 GENERAL
 We design and market Skechers-branded lifestyle footwear for men, women and children, and performance footwear for men and women under the Skechers Performance brand name. We also design and market men’s and women’s Skechers branded lifestyle apparel, and license the Skechers brand to others for accessories, pet accessories, leather goods, eyewear and scrub manufacturers, among others. Skechers footwear reflects a combination of innovation, style, comfort, quality and value that appeals to a broad range of consumers. Our product offering is sold through department and specialty stores, athletic and independent retailers, boutiques and online retailers. In addition to wholesale distribution, our footwear is available on our direct-to-consumer websites and in our own retail stores. Our objective is to profitably grow our operations worldwide while leveraging our recognizable Skechers brand through our diversified product lines, innovative advertising and diversified distribution channels.
 We seek to offer consumers a vast array of footwear that satisfies their active, casual, dress casual and athletic footwear needs. Our core consumers are attracted to our relevant brand image, fashion-forward designs, affordable and comfortable product, as well as athletes and fitness enthusiasts attracted to our performance footwear. Many of our best-selling and core styles are also developed for children with colors and materials that reflect a playful image appropriate for this demographic. Further, we offer children a unique collection of footwear designed just for them, including those with innovative light technology.
 We believe that brand recognition is an important element for success in the footwear business. We have aggressively marketed our brands through comprehensive marketing campaigns for men, women and children. During 2020, the Skechers brand was supported by print, television, digital, radio and outdoor campaigns as well as donation events for BOBS from Skechers. To further drive recognition, we have enlisted numerous celebrities, former and current athletes, and influencers to appear in our campaigns. In 2020, our brand ambassadors included Sugar Ray Leonard, Tony Romo, Howie Long, and Brooke Burke, along with athletes Edward Cheserek, Meb Keflezighi, Matt Kuchar and Brooke Henderson.
 Since 1992, when we introduced our first line, Skechers USA Sport Utility Footwear, we have expanded our product offering and grown our sales while substantially increasing the breadth and penetration of our account base. Our men’s, women’s and children’s product lines benefit from the Skechers reputation for style, quality, comfort, innovation and affordability. Our Performance lines benefit from our marketing, product development, technology, and feedback from athletes and wear testers. To promote innovation and brand relevance, we manage our product lines through separate dedicated sales and design teams. 
SKECHERS LINES
 We offer a wide array of Skechers-branded footwear lines for men, women and children, many of which have categories that have developed into well-known names. Most of these categories are marketed and packaged with unique shoe boxes, hangtags and in-store support.
 Lifestyle Brands. Our lifestyle offering includes multiple categories such as Skechers USA, Skechers Sport, Skechers Active, Modern Comfort, Skechers Street, Mark Nason, the charity-minded BOBS from Skechers collection, among others. Comfort, style and value are at the cornerstone of our vast lifestyle collections. Types of footwear sold under this division include casual, casual athletic, sport athletic, trail, sandals, boots, and retro fashion. Innovation is also important within our lifestyle offering and select styles across many lines include a patented Arch Fit insole design for podiatrist-certified arch support and Goodyear Performance Outsoles for enhanced traction, stability and durability. Also within our lifestyle collections are collaborations with known brands and properties—including street artists, influential boutiques and manga characters.

Performance Brands. Skechers Performance encompasses several technical footwear lines, each designed with a focus on specific activities to maximize performance and promote comfort. The Skechers Performance division designs footwear to utilize the latest advancements in materials and innovative design, including lightweight ULTRA GO and HYPER BURST midsole compounds for comfort and responsive feedback. Skechers Performance includes the lines of Skechers GOrun, Skechers GOwalk, Skechers GOtrain, Skechers GOtrail, and Skechers GO Golf. Additional features found in select styles across multiple categories include Arch Fit insoles, Goodyear Performance Outsoles, and Max Cushioning designs.
 Skechers Kids. Skechers Kids is comprised of a wide range of sneakers, casuals, boots, and sandals for boys and girls of all ages – pairing the latest trends with innovative comfort technology. The Skechers Kids offering includes its namesake collection; Skechers Mega-Craft; S-Lights; SKECH-AIR; Foamies, Twinkle Toes; Z-Strap; Skechers Stretch Fit; and Skechers Street. Skechers Kids also includes shoes that are designed as “takedowns” of their adult counterparts, allowing younger consumers the opportunity to wear the same popular styles as their older siblings and schoolmates. This “takedown” strategy maintains the product’s integrity by offering premium leathers, hardware and outsoles without the costs involved in designing and developing new products. In addition, we adapt current fashions from our men’s and women’s lines by modifying designs and choosing colors and materials that are more suitable for the playful image that we have established in the children’s footwear market.
 Skechers Work. Skechers Work offers a complete line of men’s and women’s slip-resistant and safety-toe casuals, boots, hikers and athletic shoes for professionals who use protective footwear across a wide range of work environments. Skechers Work styles include safety features such as steel, composite and lightweight safety toes; puncture resistance; waterproofing and electrostatic-dissipative technology, as well as Skechers’ comfort technologies such as Relaxed Fit construction; Max Cushioning; Skechers Memory Foam insoles and Arch Fit insoles. Designed for men and women working in jobs with certain safety requirements, these durable styles are constructed on high-abrasion, long-wearing soles for prolonged durability.
 In addition, Skechers designs and markets a collection of lifestyle apparel for men, women and kids. The collection features the same Skechers characteristics that consumers around the world have come to expect from the brand. The activewear garments are designed to directly coordinate with the brand’s footwear initiatives. The Skechers apparel collection is sold at Skechers retail stores, to our domestic wholesale accounts and select international partners.
 PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
 Our principal goal in product design is to develop innovative, comfortable, stylish, quality footwear at a reasonable price for the entire family. Our footwear is designed for active lifestyles and consumers needing comfort in their footwear from fashionable 18- to 34-year-olds, to a broader base of 5- to 50-year-olds, and even an exclusive selection for infants and toddlers. Designed by the Skechers Performance Division, our performance products are for professional and recreational athletes who want a technical shoe that performs under the demands of competition. 
 We believe that our products’ success is related to our ability to recognize trends in the footwear markets and to design products that anticipate and accommodate consumers’ ever-evolving preferences. Lifestyle trend information is compiled and analyzed by our designers in various ways, including reviewing and analyzing pop culture, clothing, and trend-setting media; traveling to domestic and international fashion markets to identify and confirm current trends; consulting with our customers for information on current retail selling trends; participating in major footwear trade shows to stay abreast of popular brands, fashions and styles; and subscribing to various fashion and color information services. In addition, a key component of our design philosophy is to continually reinterpret and develop our successful styles in our brands’ images.
 SOURCING
 Factories. Our products are produced by independent contract manufacturers located primarily in Asia. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We believe that the use of independent manufacturers substantially increases our production flexibility and capacity, while reducing capital expenditures and avoiding the costs of managing a large production work force.
 When possible, we seek to use manufacturers that have previously produced our footwear, which we believe enhances continuity and quality while controlling production costs. To help avoid disruption of our product supply due to political instability, civil unrest, economic instability, changes in government policies or regulations, natural and manmade disasters, and other risks, we source product from multiple facilities across multiple countries. We believe that the existing production capacity at our third-party manufacturers’ facilities is sufficient to handle expected volume in the foreseeable future.
 We finance our production activities in part through the use of interest-bearing open purchase arrangements with certain of our contract manufacturers. These facilities currently bear interest at a rate between 0.0% and 0.4% for 30- to 60-day financing, depending on the factory. We believe that the use of these arrangements affords us additional liquidity and flexibility. We do not have any long-term contracts with any of our manufacturers. However, we have long-standing relationships with many of our contract manufacturers and believe our relationships to be good.

Production Oversight. To safeguard product quality and consistency, we oversee the key aspects of production from initial prototype manufacture, through initial production runs, to final manufacture. Monitoring of all production is performed in the U.S. by our in-house production department and in Asia through staff working from our offices in China and Vietnam. We believe that our Asia presence allows us to negotiate supplier and manufacturer arrangements more effectively, decrease product turnaround time, and ensure timely delivery of finished footwear. In addition, we require our manufacturers to operate in a manner consistent with the Skechers Supplier Code of Conduct posted on our corporate website. We partner with factories that ensure humane conditions for their employees and we engage in routine auditing and monitoring procedures to ensure that those who contribute to our product are treated with the civility and respect they deserve.
 Quality Control. We believe that quality control is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products. Our quality control program is designed to ensure that not only finished goods meet our established design specifications, but also that all goods bearing our trademarks meet our standards for quality. Our quality control personnel located in China and Vietnam perform an array of inspection procedures at various stages of the production process, including examination and testing of prototypes of key raw materials prior to manufacture, samples and materials at various stages of production and final products prior to shipment. Our employees are on-site at each of our major manufacturers to oversee production. For some of our lower volume manufacturers, our staff is on-site during significant production runs, or we will perform unannounced visits to their manufacturing sites to further monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications.
 Sustainability. We believe that sustainability is an important responsibility in managing our business. We have worked to make our packaging more sustainable for the more-than-150 million pairs of Skechers that consumers purchase every year. Since 2016, we’ve reduced our products’ packaging plastics by 85% down to 10% of our foot forms, and have made remaining plastics completely recyclable. Many facilities can now recycle 93% of Skechers-branded shoeboxes, and all of our foot forms and tissue paper packaging is also recyclable and printed with soy-or water-based ink. We are proud to have 99% of our shoes packaged in shoeboxes that meet the FSC® standard for responsible resources, and we are continually looking out for new ways to improve with green materials, regular assessments, and assurance that our items are FSC-certified, recycled or ethically harvested.
 Our shipping methods reflect our green-minded approach to sustainability: master cartons are printed with soy-or-water-based ink and are 100% recyclable, and at the distribution centers managing more than 90% of our business, our outbound shipping cartons are made with 96%-100% recyclable materials and are 100% recyclable.
 Many of our facilities are designed and operated with sustainability in mind, including America’s largest LEED Gold certified distribution facility in Rancho Belago, California. Our new corporate headquarters in Manhattan Beach, California are also being designed and developed to qualify for LEED certification.
 Product Styles. We closely monitor sales activity after initial introduction of a product in our concept stores and on-line to determine whether there is substantial demand for a style, thereby aiding us in our sourcing decisions. Styles that have substantial consumer appeal are highlighted in upcoming collections or offered as part of our periodic style offerings, while less popular styles can be discontinued after a limited production run. We believe that sales in our concept stores can also help forecast sales in national retail stores, and we share this sales information with our wholesale customers. Sales, merchandising, production and allocations management analyze historical and current sales along with market data from our wholesale account base and our own retail stores to develop an internal product quantity forecast that allows us to manage our future production and inventory levels. For those styles with high sell-through percentages, we maintain an in-stock position to minimize the time necessary to fill customer orders by placing orders with our manufacturers prior to the time we receive customers’ orders for such footwear.
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
 With a marketing philosophy of “Unseen, Untold, Unsold,” we take a targeted approach to marketing to drive traffic, build brand recognition and properly position our diverse lines within the marketplace. Senior management is directly involved in shaping our image and the conception, development and implementation of our advertising and marketing activities. Our marketing plan has an omni-channel approach, and we utilize print, outdoor, television, radio, and digital, along with public relations, influencers and social media, promotions, and in-store events. In addition, we utilize celebrity endorsers in some of our advertisements. We also believe our websites are effective marketing tools to consumers. We have historically budgeted advertising as a percentage of projected sales. 
PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS 
 We have three reportable segments: Domestic Wholesale, International Wholesale, and Direct-to-Consumer. In the U.S., our products are available through a network of wholesale customers comprised of department, athletic and specialty stores and online retailers. Internationally, our products are available through wholesale customers in more than 170 countries and territories via our global network of distributors as well as through our subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, Canada, Central America and South America. Skechers owns and operates retail stores both domestically and internationally through three integrated retail formats—concept, factory outlet and warehouse outlet stores. Each of these channels serves an integral function in the global distribution of our products.

In addition, 18 distributors and 51 licensees have opened and operate 799 distributor-owned or -licensed Skechers retail stores and 1,771 licensee-owned Skechers retail stores, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.
 Domestic Wholesale. We distribute our footwear through the following domestic wholesale distribution channels: big-box footwear stores, department stores, wholesale clubs, specialty stores, athletic specialty shoe stores, independent retailers, and internet retailers. Skechers footwear is available in a variety of wholesale customers, many of whom may operate stores within the same retail location due to our distinct product lines, variety of styles and the price criteria of their specific customers. Management has a clearly defined growth strategy for each of our channels of distribution. An integral component of our strategy is to offer our accounts the highest level of customer service so that our products will be fully represented in existing and new customer retail locations.
 In an effort to provide knowledgeable and personalized service to our wholesale customers, the sales force is segregated by product line, each of which is headed by a vice president or national sales manager. Reporting to each sales manager are knowledgeable account executives and territory managers. The vice presidents and national sales managers report to our senior vice president of sales. All of our vice presidents and national sales managers are compensated on a salary basis, while our account executives and territory managers are compensated on a commission basis. None of our domestic sales personnel sells competing products.
 International Wholesale. Our products are sold in more than 170 countries and territories throughout the world. We generate revenues from outside the U.S. from three principal sources: (i) sales to department stores and specialty retail stores through our joint ventures in Mexico, Asia and the Middle East, as well as through our subsidiaries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia; (ii) sales to international distributors who deliver our footwear to department stores, specialty retail stores and third-party-owned Skechers stores in select countries and territories across Asia, South America, Africa, the Middle East and Australia; and (iii) to a lesser extent, royalties from licensees who manufacture and distribute our non-footwear products abroad.
 We believe that international distribution of our products represents a significant opportunity to increase sales and profits. We intend to further increase our share of the international footwear market by heightening our marketing in those countries in which we currently have a presence through our international advertising campaigns, which are designed to establish Skechers as a global lifestyle and performance brand.

• | Distributors and Licensees
--+---------------------------

 Where we do not sell directly through our international subsidiaries and joint ventures, our footwear is distributed through a network of more than 23 distributors who sell our products to department, athletic and specialty stores. As of December 31, 2020, we also had agreements with 18 of these distributors and 51 licensees regarding 799 distributor-owned or licensed Skechers retail stores and 1,771 licensee-owned Skechers retail stores. Our distributors, licensees and franchisees own and operate the following retail stores in more than 170 countries around the world:
 
 
 | Number of Store Locations at December 31, 2019 | | Opened during 2020 | | Closed during 2020 | Number of Store Locations at December 31, 2020 |

South America | | 35 | | 2 | | — | | 37 
Total distributor, licensee and franchise stores | | 2,393 | | 430 | | (253 | ) | 2,570

 Distributors and licensees are responsible for their respective stores’ operations, have ownership of their respective stores’ assets, and select the broad collection of our products to sell to consumers in their regions. In order to maintain a globally consistent image, we provide architectural, graphic and visual guidance and materials for the design of the stores, and we train the local staff on our products and corporate culture. We intend to expand our international presence and global recognition of the Skechers brand name by continuing to sell our footwear to foreign distributors and by opening retail stores with distributors that have local market expertise. 
 Direct-to-Consumer. We pursue our direct-to-consumer strategy through our integrated retail formats: e-commerce, concept stores, factory outlet and warehouse outlet stores. Our formats enable us to promote the full Skechers product offering in an attractive environment that appeals to a broad group of consumers. 
  
• | E-commerce – Our company-owned e-commerce business enable consumers to shop, browse, find store locations, socially interact, post a shoe review, and immerse themselves in our brands. Additionally, the e-commerce business provides an efficient and effective retail distribution channel, which has improved our customer service and brand experience.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Concept Stores – Our concept stores are located at high street locations, major tourist areas or in key shopping malls in metropolitan cities. Our concept stores have a threefold purpose in our operating strategy. First, concept stores serve as a showcase for a wide range of our product offering for the current season, as we estimate that our average wholesale customer carries no more than 5% of the complete Skechers line in any one location. Our concept stores showcase our products in an attractive, easy-to-shop open-floor setting, providing the consumer with the complete Skechers story. Second, retail locations are generally chosen to generate maximum marketing value for the Skechers brand name through signage, store front presentation and interior design. Domestic locations include concept stores at Times Square, and 34th Street, in New York; Powell Street in San Francisco: Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade; Ala Moana Center in

Hawaii; South Beach Miami’s Lincoln Road and Las Vegas’ Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian. International locations include Oxford Street and Covent Garden in London; Rue de Rivoli in Paris; Via del Corso in Rome; Kaufingerstraße in Munich; Toronto’s Eaton Centre; and the Shinsaibashi shopping district of Osaka, Harajuku and Shibuya in Tokyo. The stores are typically designed to create a distinctive Skechers look and feel, and enhance customer association of the Skechers brand name with current youthful lifestyle trends and styles. Third, the concept stores serve as marketing and product testing venues. We believe that product sell-through information and rapid customer feedback derived from our concept stores enables our design, sales, merchandising and production staff to respond to market changes and new product introductions. Such responses serve to augment sales and limit our inventory markdowns and customer returns.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The typical Skechers concept store is approximately 3,000 square feet, although in certain markets we have concept stores ranging from 600 square feet to 14,300 square feet. When deciding where to open concept stores, we identify top geographic markets in larger metropolitan cities around the world. 
  
• | Factory Outlet Stores – Our factory outlet stores are generally located in manufacturers’ direct outlet centers in the U.S. and in select international markets. Our factory outlet stores provide opportunities for us to sell discontinued and excess merchandise, thereby reducing the need to sell such merchandise to discounters at excessively low prices and potentially compromise the Skechers brand image. Skechers’ factory outlet stores range in size from approximately 850 to 24,100 square feet. Unlike our warehouse outlet stores, inventory in these stores is supplemented by certain first-line styles sold at full retail price points.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Warehouse Outlet Stores – Our free-standing and attached warehouse outlet stores, which are primarily located throughout the U.S. and Canada, enable us to liquidate excess merchandise, discontinued lines and odd-size inventory that would otherwise typically be sold to discounters at excessively low prices, which could compromise the Skechers brand image. Skechers’ warehouse outlet stores are typically larger than our factory outlet stores ranging in size from approximately 4,000 to 30,600 square feet. We seek to open our warehouse outlet stores in areas that are in close proximity to our concept stores to facilitate the timely transfer of inventory that we want to liquidate as soon as practicable.

LICENSING
 We believe that selective licensing of the Skechers brand name and our product line names to manufacturers may broaden and enhance the individual brands without requiring significant capital investments or additional incremental operating expenses. Our multiple product lines plus additional subcategories present many potential licensing opportunities on terms with licensees that we believe will provide more effective manufacturing, distribution or marketing of non-footwear products. We believe that the reputation of Skechers and its history in launching brands has also enabled us to partner with reputable non-footwear brands to design and market their footwear.

As of December 31, 2020, we had 23 active domestic and international licensing agreements in which we are the licensor. These include Skechers-branded kids’ apparel; bags, backpacks and lunch boxes; belts, wallets and travel accessories, and watches for adults and kids; headwear, socks and shoe care; prescription and sunglass eyewear; outerwear, swimwear, underwear, sleepwear and medical scrubs; fitness and yoga accessories; headwear; and cold weather products. Additional category-specific collections include Skechers Sport apparel, bags, backpacks and headwear; Twinkle Toes backpacks and lunchboxes; Skechers Work socks and Skechers Go Golf apparel for men and women. We also have BOBS from Skechers pet accessories in Petco. We have international licensing agreements for the design and distribution of prescription and sunglass eyewear globally; men’s, women’s and kids’ apparel in the United Kingdom; kids’ apparel in Europe; socks and watches throughout Europe; bags and backpacks in the Philippines, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Europe Russia, Scandinavia and the Middle East; medical scrubs in the Middle East, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand; apparel, socks, headwear, bags, and backpacks in Indonesia; apparel, socks, and bags in Mexico; bags, backpacks, luggage, wallets, watches, medical scrubs and accessories in Latin America; apparel, bags, and backpacks, headwear, socks, and shoe care Turkey; socks in Japan and watches in the Philippines.
 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
 We believe that strong distribution support is a critical factor in our operations. Once manufactured, our products are packaged in shoe boxes bearing bar codes that are shipped either: (i) to our approximate 2.8 million square-foot North American distribution center located in California, (ii) to our approximate 1.8 million square-foot European Distribution Center located in Belgium, (iii) to our company-operated distribution centers or third-party distribution centers in Central America, South America and Asia, or (vi) directly from third-party manufacturers to our other international customers and other international third-party distribution centers. Upon receipt at either of the distribution centers, merchandise is inspected and recorded in our management information system and packaged according to customers’ orders for delivery. Merchandise is shipped to customers by whatever means each customer requests, which is usually by common carrier. The distribution centers have multi-access docks, enabling us to receive and ship simultaneously, and to pack separate trailers for shipments to different customers at the same time. We have an electronic data interchange system which is linked to some of our larger customers. This system allows these customers to automatically place orders with us, thereby eliminating the time involved in transmitting and inputting orders, and it includes direct billing and shipping information.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 We own and utilize a variety of trademarks, including the Skechers trademark. We have a significant number of both registrations and pending applications for our U.S. trademarks. In addition, we have trademark registrations and trademark applications in approximately 155 foreign countries. We also have design patents and pending design and utility patent applications in both the U.S. and approximately 39 foreign countries. We continuously look to increase the number of our patents and trademarks both domestically and internationally, where necessary to protect valuable intellectual property. We regard our trademarks and other intellectual property as valuable assets, and believe that they have significant value in marketing our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, including through the use of cease and desist letters, administrative proceedings and lawsuits.
COMPETITION
 The global footwear industry is a competitive business. Although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company with respect to its entire range of products, our products compete with other branded products within their product category as well as with private label products sold by retailers, including some of our customers. Our footwear competes with footwear offered by companies such as Columbia Sportswear Company, Nike, Inc., Crocs, Inc., Deckers Outdoor Corporation, Kenneth Cole Productions Inc., Steven Madden, Ltd., V.F. Corporation, Adidas AG, Reebok International, Puma SE, ASICS America Corporation, New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., Under Armor Inc. and Wolverine World Wide, Inc. These and other competitors pose challenges to our market share in domestic and international markets. We also compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of footwear for the limited shelf space available for displaying such products to the consumer. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing capacity allows ease of access by new market entrants. Some of our competitors are larger, have been in existence for a longer period of time, have strong brand recognition, have captured greater market share and/or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. 
EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 11,700 persons, of whom approximately 5,900 were employed on a full-time basis and approximately 5,800 were employed on a part-time basis, primarily in our retail stores. As a family-focused brand, Skechers was founded on the philosophy of putting people first – offering comfort and care to its employees and customers, and supporting both with dignity and respect. Human rights is a core value at the heart of how we conduct our business, at every level of our company – from our factories to our suppliers.
