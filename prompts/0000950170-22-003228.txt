 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing next-generation, systemically active viral immunotherapies to transform outcomes for cancer patients. Using our two proprietary platforms, we are developing a pipeline of intratumorally and intravenously administered product candidates designed to selectively attack and kill tumor cells and deliver transgenes to stimulate multiple arms of the immune system against tumors. We believe the therapies that we are developing will bring significant benefit to many patients who are currently underserved by approved immuno-oncology therapies, including other viral immunotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Our lead product candidate, ONCR-177, is an intratumorally, or iTu, administered viral immunotherapy based on our oncolytic HSV-1 platform, referred to as our HSV Platform, which leverages the Herpes Simplex Virus type 1, or HSV-1, a virus which has been clinically proven to effectively treat certain cancers. We are also developing a broad pipeline of product candidates that leverages our second platform, our selectively self-amplifying viral RNA, or vRNA, immunotherapy platform, referred to as our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform, which aims to enable repeat intravenous, or IV, administration of viral immunotherapies to treat cancers that are less amenable to intratumoral injection due to safety and feasibility reasons, such as cancers of the lung.
Viral immunotherapies cause immunogenic cell death by way of viral oncolysis, which has the added benefit of exposing all the tumor’s neoantigens to the immune system. These therapies can also be engineered to express multiple transgenes to further stimulate robust and durable patient-specific anti-tumor immune responses. Using our HSV Platform, we engineered ONCR-177 to overcome the limitations of existing viral immunotherapies by enhancing potency and driving strong systemic anti-tumor immune responses at injected as well as distant non-injected tumor sites, or abscopal activity. ONCR-177 is armed with five immunostimulatory transgenes—IL-12, CCL4, FLT3LG, a PD-1 antagonist nanobody and a CTLA-4 antagonist monoclonal antibody (which has the same amino acid sequence as ipilimumab)—a greater number of transgenes than viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development. In multiple preclinical cancer models, immune cells activated by ONCR-177 and its encoded payloads have been shown to drive both anti-tumor responses in injected tumors and abscopal activity. Product candidates from our HSV Platform, including ONCR-177, are designed to maintain full viral replication competency in tumors and are designed to be selectively attenuated in healthy tissues, meaning they replicate and express transgenes only in tumor cells while disabling potentially harmful effects on healthy tissues. In multiple preclinical cancer models, we observed that these attributes of ONCR-177 were achieved without either the systemic release of cytokines that can be associated with toxicity or significant presence of the virus in non-injected tumors or in circulation, in addition to favorable tolerability when administered via intravenous and intratumoral injection in a validated murine model of HSV-1 infection. We believe this combination of features allows our HSV Platform to overcome the safety versus potency trade-off that has generally limited the viral immunotherapy field to date. Based on safety and tolerability profile observed to date and its ability to stimulate multiple arms of the immune system to attack cancer systemically, we also believe that ONCR-177 has potential in pre-surgical, or neoadjuvant, settings.
In June 2020, we initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177 in patients with several different types of solid tumors, including breast cancers and cutaneous tumors. We presented our preliminary findings from the Phase 1 clinical trial in November 2021 via a poster presentation at the 36th annual meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC. The presentation included data from 14 patients in the fully enrolled and completed dose escalation cohorts of the trial and five patients enrolled in the dose expansion monotherapy portion of the trial. In the fully enrolled and completed surface lesion dose escalation portion of the trial, ONCR-177 administered to heavily pretreated patients with advanced, injectable solid tumors was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. No treatment-related adverse events exceeded Grade 2, and the most common Grade 1 and 2 adverse events were fatigue, chills, nausea, and mild, dose-dependent cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. No infectious virions were detected in skin swabs, consistent with our expectations with respect to ONCR-177's safety profile. As of November 8, 2021, after four weeks of monotherapy treatment with ONCR-177 at the recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, of 4x108 PFU in 4 mL (receiving two doses of ONCR-177), three of eight evaluable patients (one with cutaneous melanoma, one with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN, and one with mucosal melanoma) had demonstrated clinical benefit. These consisted of one partial response in the patient with cutaneous melanoma as measured by calipers per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST; one investigator-reported clinical response in the SCCHN patient in their injected lymph node; and one reported stable disease in the patient with mucosal melanoma as measured by RECIST 1.1 with additional improvement in cancer-related symptoms. Several findings from this trial suggest immune stimulation of the tumor microenvironment following administration of ONCR-177, including mild, dose-dependent CRS in association with increased interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and T-cell proliferation in blood, as well evidence of tumor PD-L1 expression and immune cell infiltration.

We have initiated enrollment in the surface lesion dose combination expansion portion of the clinical trial. Patients in the trial will receive ONCR-177 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor. In addition, we are enrolling and currently dosing separate cohorts of patients with visceral tumors in the liver with the goal of showing additional safety data. We plan to report additional surface lesion monotherapy expansion data as well as initial surface lesion combination expansion data in the second half of 2022.
In addition to ONCR-177, we also have additional preclinical stage programs within our HSV Platform addressing both intratumoral and intravenous solutions to other unmet medical needs, including ONCR-GBM, our program designed to target brain cancer through intratumoral injection.
 We are also pioneering viral immunotherapy programs for repeat intravenous administration through our selectively self-amplifying vRNA Immunotherapy Platform. Our IV-administered approach involves encapbsulating in a lipid nanoparticle, or LNP, the genomes of RNA viruses known to kill cancer cells, creating a selectively self-amplifying vRNA immunotherapy. We believe this approach will avoid the rapid immune clearance from circulation caused by neutralizing antibodies otherwise observed to date with IV-administered oncolytic viruses and thought to limit their effectiveness in the clinic. Once inside the tumor, the synthetic viral genome from our synthetic viruses is first amplified and then instructs tumor cells to synthesize actual infectious virions, which can cause tumor lysis before infecting nearby tumor cells while stimulating immune cell recruitment and activity.
Our two product candidates from our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform are ONCR-021 and ONCR-788. ONCR-021 encodes an optimized strain of Coxsackievirus A21, or CVA21, and ONCR-788 encodes for a modified version of the Seneca Valley Virus, or SVV. Both CVA21 and SVV have extensive clinical experience and favorable safety profiles when administered IV. We believe our selectively self-amplifying vRNA Immunotherapy Platform holds the potential for IV administration and avoids the challenge of neutralizing antibodies seen in previous approaches with IV-administered oncolytic viruses. We plan to investigate our novel vRNA immunotherapies in multiple histologies, including cancers of the lung, both as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments. We plan to submit an IND to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for ONCR-021 in mid-2023 to enable clinical development for non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Following the IND submission for ONCR-021 and pending further resources, we plan to submit an IND for ONCR-788 to enable its development in small cell lung cancer, neuroendocrine prostate and other neuroendocrine cancers, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments. In the process of developing our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform, we also developed a proprietary LNP platform intended to efficiently deliver large nucleic acids with minimal endosomal escape.
 We plan to manufacture our product candidates at our approximately 105,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts, 41,000 of which is specifically dedicated to processes that are compliant with good manufacturing practices, or GMP. We began process development activities at the facility in 2021 and we anticipate this facility will be operational in late 2022.

Traditional cancer therapy, immunotherapy and the need for new options for cancer patients
 The treatment of certain cancers has improved markedly over the past decade. Whereas many cancer treatments were historically limited to surgical removal, cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation, recent advances target specific genetic changes in individual tumors or redirect the patient’s immune system, particularly T cells, to eliminate tumors and improve outcomes. Unfortunately, most patients are either not eligible for or do not respond to these therapies. For example, the efficacy of immune-based approaches in patients who qualify for this type of therapy is limited to around 12 percent. While these therapies have advanced the treatment of cancer for some patients, many are still underserved and therapies with improved clinical outcomes are still desperately needed.
The goal of immuno-oncology is to harness an individual’s immune system and better enable it to identify, attack and kill tumor cells and to form long-term immunologic memory against such tumors. We believe that the best way to significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients is to stimulate not only T cells, as has been the focus of approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, but also additional key immune cells within the innate and adaptive immune systems.
The immune system is generally divided into two arms, the innate and the adaptive, which are responsible for driving immediate and lasting anti-tumor responses. The innate immune system involves a diverse set of cells, including Natural-Killer, or NK, cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, all of which generate a rapid response to any foreign body, pathogen or tumor cell. The adaptive immune system is a second line of defense that is specific to a pathogen or antigen and is triggered when the innate immune system releases signals to activate and recruit cells from the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is composed of T cells and B cells that can form immunologic memory, activating upon reintroduction of the initial antigen or pathogen. Many of the recent advances in immuno-oncology, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have focused on improving the function of T cells, which are a key cell type within a patient’s adaptive immune system.
We see a vast opportunity for therapies that can stimulate robust anti-tumor responses by activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems that also influence both the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and systemic immune responses. We believe that virus-based immunotherapies offer this potential benefit by delivering potent immune stimulating agents to tumors, including not only T cells, but also NK cells and dendritic cells, and, to inhibit immune suppression within tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Our focus—unlocking the full potential of viral immunotherapies to engage multiple arms of the immune system to transform outcomes for cancer patients
We believe that viral immunotherapies are the most promising modality available today to activate multiple arms of the immune system and improve outcomes for cancer patients. Viral immunotherapy selectively infects and destroys tumor cells and leverages key cell types from the patient’s innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in a robust and durable anti-tumor response. In the process of directly killing the tumor, tumor-specific antigens and danger signaling molecules are released. These molecules recruit and activate the innate and adaptive immune responses to identify, attack and destroy tumors and to develop long-term immunity against such tumors. Viral immunotherapies can also be engineered to express transgenes to further stimulate and prevent downregulation of the immune system. Viral immunotherapies have several properties that differentiate them from other anti-tumor therapies, which make them particularly attractive additions to today’s anti-cancer arsenal, including the ability to:
▪Selectively kill tumor cells. Viral immunotherapies can be designed to selectively kill tumor cells while sparing healthy cells. Tumor cells are often more vulnerable to killing by viruses than healthy cells because tumors often have diminished antiviral defenses, such as a downregulated interferon pathway, creating an environment conducive to viral replication. 


▪Create an inflammatory state that turns cold tumors hot. When tumor cells die following viral replication, the cells release tumor specific antigens and danger signals, which activate the innate immune system through multiple pattern recognition receptors, including TLRs, RIG-I and STING, and promote inflammation within the tumor microenvironment. This in turn attracts both innate and adaptive immune cells to the area. Viral immunotherapies have been shown in the clinic to transform so-called cold tumors with low numbers of infiltrated immune cells into hot tumors with high numbers of infiltrated immune cells, which are more likely to respond to checkpoint inhibitors. 
 ▪Cause the release and presentation of tumor-specific antigens. The breadth of tumor antigens that are presented by viral immunotherapy-induced tumor cell lysis is far greater than that of other anti-tumor vaccine approaches that rely on single antigens or small collections of neoantigens. Viruses kill tumor cells by way of an immunogenic, rather than apoptotic, cell death, which not only alerts and activates the immune system, but also causes the entire contents of the tumor cell to spill out. Tumor cell contents, including tumor-specific antigens or neoantigens, are thereby exposed to the immune system. These antigens can then be presented by the recruited innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, to cells of the adaptive immune system to stimulate highly effective antigen-specific immunity. By activating the adaptive immune response, anti-tumor T cells can then identify and attack all tumors in the body in addition to forming immunologic memory, which can provide patients with durable protective immunity. 
 ▪Express transgenes within the tumor microenvironment that encode for immunostimulatory proteins. Viruses can be engineered to carry transgenes into tumors where they can be expressed in high concentrations. These transgenes have the ability to encode immunostimulatory cytokines, immune checkpoint antibodies and other proteins that can further amplify anti-tumor immune responses. The ability of viral immunotherapies to deliver potent immunostimulatory factors directly to tumors with minimal systemic exposure represents a powerful method of amplifying the initial immune response by both stimulating the infiltrating immune cells and preventing their suppression in tumors, leading to improved outcomes for cancer patients. 
 These properties have been clinically validated by viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development. For example, talimogene laherparepvec, or T-VEC, was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment of recurrent melanoma and is marketed as Imlygic® by Amgen. T-VEC is an attenuated oncolytic virus based on HSV-1, engineered to deliver a single transgene encoding for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, or GM-CSF. In a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with metastatic melanoma, patients treated intratumorally with T-VEC monotherapy had a 26 percent objective response rate compared to 6 percent for the control arm, which was GM-CSF. Notably, responses to T-VEC occurred in only 34 percent of non-injected non-visceral lesions and 15 percent of non-injected visceral lesions (lesions that are not cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal), compared to 64 percent of injected lesions, suggesting that, despite encouraging validation that this early-generation oncolytic virus can generate an immune response against a non-injected tumor, increased abscopal activity is needed to improve outcomes for patients.
Our HSV Platform—developing the next generation of oncolytic HSV-1-based viral immunotherapy
HSV-1 has emerged as the leading viral vector for immunotherapy due to its potency at killing tumor cells, its large and well-studied genome, its overall safety and sensitivity to acyclovir, and the regulatory approval pathway established by T-VEC. We designed our HSV Platform to develop improved viral immunotherapies that overcome the limitations in potency and in the ability to stimulate anti-tumor immunity that have both been encountered by previous viral immunotherapies and other immuno-oncology therapies. We also intend to develop therapies derived from this platform that will address multiple types of tumors, including our ONCR-GBM program designed to target brain cancer.
Our HSV Platform improves upon three basic characteristics of viral immunotherapies:
▪Greater capacity to encode transgenes to drive systemic immunostimulatory activity. Using our proprietary technology, we are developing HSV-1-based product candidates with the ability to carry greater numbers of transgenes than viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development. The ability to deliver a combination of rationally and experimentally selected transgenes directly into tumors enables the promotion of greater systemic immunostimulatory activity than could otherwise be achieved. It also enables the delivery of multiple immunostimulatory agents directly to tumors, including those that cannot be safely dosed in patients due to systemic toxicities, such as IL-12. 
 ▪Retention of full replication competency to enable high tumor-killing potency. Using our proprietary HSV Platform, we are developing product candidates that retain their full ability to replicate in tumor cells. In contrast, current HSV-1-based viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development have introduced mutations which attenuate their replication competency in both normal and tumor tissues in order to limit toxicity. We believe this has the effect of lowering the potency of the virus in tumor cells and trading off potency for safety.
 ▪Orthogonal safety strategies to allow tumor-specific replication. Our HSV Platform incorporates two highly innovative approaches to restrict viral activity to tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues. The first approach involves the insertion of gene regulatory elements known as microRNA target sequences within the genomes of viruses. The microRNAs complementary to these target sequences are primarily found only in healthy tissues and not in tumor tissues. The second 


approach involves a proprietary mutation in an HSV-1 protein known as UL37, which eliminates the virus’ ability to transport, replicate and establish latency inside neurons.
Our lead product candidate—ONCR-177
We are developing ONCR-177 for the treatment of multiple cancers. ONCR-177 is a replication-competent oncolytic HSV-1 viral immunotherapy for intratumoral injection carrying five transgenes designed to stimulate multiple arms of the immune system in order to maximize anti-tumor immune responses and abscopal responses in non-injected tumors. In preclinical experiments, we observed durable virus and immune system driven anti-tumor activity in injected tumors as well as abscopal activity. Our Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177 in patients with several different types of solid tumors, including breast cancers and cutaneous tumors is ongoing. In November 2021, we reported data from the fully enrolled and completed surface lesion dose escalation part of the Phase 1 trial suggesting that ONCR-177 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. We completed enrollment in the dose expansion portion of the trial and continue to enroll patients in the combination cohort, with future data readouts to include both additional surface lesion monotherapy expansion data and initial surface lesion expansion data in the second half of 2022.
ONCR-177 has broad application for multiple solid tumor indications
Each year in the United States, approximately 1.5 million patients are diagnosed with solid tumor cancers, and approximately 550,000 die from these diseases. Potentially any patient with a solid tumor can be treated by intratumoral injection, so there is a large unmet medical need for effective intratumoral therapy. Cancers potentially most addressable by intratumoral therapy include breast cancers, including triple negative and hormone receptor positive breast cancers, SCCHN, both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, and injectable visceral tumors that have spread to the liver. There are several advantages of administering potential therapies by intratumoral injection, including the ability to directly target the tumor, resulting in high local concentrations of therapeutic agent as well as lower systemic exposure to the therapy, which we believe could potentially limit systemic toxicities.
Key features of ONCR-177
We have designed ONCR-177 to achieve both oncolytic anti-tumor activity and potent immune system stimulation. We have applied our technologies to ONCR-177 to improve upon current HSV-1-based viral immunotherapies by engineering the virus to deliver directly into the tumor a greater number of transgenes than the viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development, as well as to retain its full replication competency while broadening tumor infectivity and preventing replication in healthy tissues.
Delivery of five immunostimulatory transgenes to stimulate systemic anti-tumor responses in both injected and non-injected tumors
Fundamental to our engineering of ONCR-177 is our proprietary deletion of the joint region in HSV-1, creating 25kb of additional payload capacity and enabling us to include a rationally and experimentally selected combination of five immunostimulatory transgenes. Our goal was to include a diverse set of transgenes that increase the overall potency of ONCR-177 in a broad range of potential tumors and, in particular, improve abscopal activity. In our selection process, we evaluated 15 potential transgenes, including GM-CSF, the transgene included in T-VEC, and prioritized transgenes for inclusion in ONCR-177 based on their ability to enhance systemic anti-tumor immune responses in cancer models. We chose transgenes with the expectation that ONCR-177 would lead to their expression within these tumors with very limited systemic exposure. This feature allowed us to consider transgenes with promising anti-tumor activity that are challenging to deliver intravenously as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, due to their inherent toxicities. We prioritized combinations of transgenes that work through complimentary, but not overlapping, mechanisms to stimulate multiple arms of the immune system. Our evaluations suggest that the optimal combination of transgenes within ONCR-177 is:
▪Interleukin-12, or IL-12—IL-12 is a potent stimulatory cytokine with established anti-tumoral properties. IL-12 displays multifaceted activities leading to broad immune stimulation of both innate immune cells, such as NK cells, and adaptive immune cells, such as T cells. Intravenous administration of IL-12 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical cancer models; however, its clinical development as a systemic agent has been limited by its toxicity profile. Intratumoral delivery of IL-12 by ONCR-177 strongly stimulated abscopal activity in preclinical cancer models without causing systemic toxicity. 
 ▪C-C motif chemokine 4, or CCL4—CCL4 is an inflammatory chemokine that recruits T cells, monocytes and classical dendritic cells to sites of tissue injury or viral infection. Classical dendritic cells have been shown to be particularly important for the presentation of tumor antigens and response to immune therapy. Low CCL4 levels in tumors are predictive of poor T cell infiltration, which is characteristic of cold tumors. The inclusion of CCL4 in ONCR-177 may therefore enhance the recruitment of T cells and dendritic cells within a cold tumor to enhance response to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. 
 ▪Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, or FLT3LG—FLT3LG is a major growth factor that stimulates the proliferation and commitment of classical tumor antigen cross presenting dendritic cells, which are critical for anti-tumor immune responses. We have also shown that the addition of FLT3LG enhanced the abscopal anti-tumor activity of a virus expressing IL-12 in preclinical models. 


▪PD-1 antagonist nanobody—PD-1 is an immune checkpoint that prevents activation of cytotoxic T cells. Its blockade has been clinically validated as an oncology target with the approval of multiple therapies that inhibit the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand, PD-L1. PD-L1 upregulation is a major mechanism of acquired resistance in response to high levels of interferon gamma that are the result of productive anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses. Inclusion of a PD-1 antagonist nanobody in ONCR-177 is designed to overcome both the endogenous tumor-specific PD-L1 expression as well as increased PD-L1 expression induced in response to the virus, and has demonstrated abscopal benefit in preclinical studies. 
 ▪CTLA-4 antagonist monoclonal antibody; identical in sequence to ipilimumab—CTLA-4 is a clinically validated immune checkpoint inhibitor that regulates the activation of T cells independently from PD-1. Co-targeting of CTLA-4 and PD- 1 by intravenous administration of blocking antibodies has increased clinical efficacy but is associated with significantly greater toxicities. Inclusion of these two clinically validated immune checkpoint inhibitors in ONCR-177 has the potential to deliver a synergistic activation of anti-tumor immunity with improved tolerability, which we believe will be a result of the intratumoral route of administration. 
 The multiple mechanisms of action mediated by ONCR-177’s inherent oncolytic activity together with the immune stimulation elicited by the viral infection and the expression of these five transgenes are illustrated in the figure below.
 
Figure 1. Mechanisms of action of ONCR-177. ONCR-177 infected cells allow the production of five payloads as well as viral replication that induces cancer cell oncolysis. The oncolysis results in the release of all tumor antigens and also signals trigger inflammation. CCL4 and FLT3LG can induce the recruitment and differentiation of tumor antigen presenting dendritic cells and IL-12 activates the NK cells and T cells to enhance their cytolytic activity. CTLA-4 blockade promotes the priming and activation of T cells while the PD-1 antagonist prevents the exhaustion of T cells. The T cells can migrate to the other tumor sites to enable abscopal responses.

Retention of full replication competency
ONCR-177 was designed as a fully replication competent HSV-1-based viral immunotherapy to allow for robust viral replication in tumor cells and generate greater tumor lysis and activation of the immune system as compared to HSV-1-based viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development. The ability of HSV-1 to infect human cells has led others to develop HSV-1-derived viral immunotherapies with genetic changes that limit replication by inactivating the γ34.5 gene in order to protect healthy tissue. Inactivation of γ34.5 makes HSV-1 more vulnerable to the normal antiviral activity of the endogenous interferon pathway, which the body uses to fight viral infections. Consequently, current HSV-1-based viral immunotherapies containing this mutation are less able to replicate in the presence of interferon alpha, or IFN-α. Unfortunately, inactivation of γ34.5 also leads to unwanted attenuation of viral replication in cancer cells, thereby limiting the potential for these therapies to impact the survival and growth of cancer cells. ONCR-177 retains an active version of the gene that encodes for γ34.5 and, therefore, is able to replicate in the presence of IFNα, as seen in the figure below.
 
Figure 2. Impact of inclusion of γ34.5 in our HSV Platform product candidates. Inclusion of γ34.5 in our HSV-1 vectors allows replication in presence of IFNα compared to a γ34.5 deleted virus for which complete suppression of replication is observed in the presence of interferon. Abbreviations: PFU=plaque-forming units.
We have chosen not to sacrifice the inherent potency of HSV-1 in cancer cells and have implemented other methods to limit the ability of our HSV-1-based product candidates to replicate in healthy cells. We believe the retention of γ34.5 enables our candidates to generate robust infections in tumor cells to drive anti-tumor activity.
Broaden tumor infectivity and increasing the rate of infection
To enhance the ability of HSV-1 to infect a broad spectrum of tumor cells, we have introduced a set of specific mutations in the HSV-1 gB protein, which is a surface glycoprotein that mediates viral entry into cells during infection. These mutations, referred to as gB:N/T mutations, have been shown to increase the range of cells that HSV-1 can infect in addition to increasing the rate of infection. Studies published by one of our co-founders, Professor Glorioso in the Journal of Virology in 2012, showed that introduction of these mutations into otherwise identical copies of HSV-1 viruses lead to greatly enhanced infectivity of cell lines, including those lacking the normal receptors for HSV-1. We believe gB:N/T mutations enable our HSV-1-based product candidates to generate robust infections in a broad spectrum of tumor cells and increase the rate of infection.

Tissue-specific safety controls
 We balanced the native viral replication competency and increased infectivity in the development of ONCR-177 with a set of specific genetic safety switches that prevent ONCR-177 from replicating in non-tumor cells and also causing latent infections in neuronal cells using two orthogonal safety strategies. First, we implemented a series of conditional genetic switches in the genetic sequence of ONCR-177 that limit the ability of ONCR-177 to replicate in non-tumor cells. These switches are controlled by the presence of RNA molecules, referred to as microRNAs or miRs, and selectively disable key viral genes responsible for HSV-1 replication and pathogenicity in healthy tissues by targeted RNA silencing via the RNA-induced silencing complex. The microRNAs we selected for ONCR-177 attenuation are differentially expressed in tumors versus healthy tissues as detailed below.
 
Figure 3. Principle for microRNA, or miR, dependent attenuation of ONCR-177 in healthy tissues. microRNA target sequences, or miR-T, engineered into our HSV product candidates function as conditional switches to control viral replication based on the expression of their complementary microRNAs that were selected to be absent or expressed at low level in tumors versus to normal healthy tissues.

Our attenuation strategy is based on the differential expression of this subset of microRNAs in cancer compared to healthy tissues
To identify these microRNAs, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 800 regulatory microRNAs in normal and tumor cells. As triggers for the shutdown of ONCR-177 in healthy cells, we chose a set of ten microRNAs from this analysis that are highly expressed in tissues such as those of the nervous system, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and organs such as the liver and pancreas and not expressed in the tumors we intend to treat with ONCR-177.
 
Figure 4. The heatmap above shows the differential expression of the microRNAs selected for ONCR-177 attenuation in cancer compared to healthy tissues. Abbreviations: Mal.=malignant.
We introduced microRNA target sequences into four critical HSV-1 genes such that the presence of the corresponding microRNAs in healthy tissues would prevent viral replication and disease development. These genes include infected-cell polypeptide 4, or ICP4, and infected-cell polypeptide 27, or ICP27, both of which are transcriptional regulatory proteins essential for viral growth; UL8, a component of the viral replication complex, which we identified as an essential gene for viral replication; and γ34.5, which is required for inhibition of host cells’ antiviral response. This microRNA attenuation strategy for ONCR-177 is reflected in the figure below.
    

Figure 5. Overview of ONCR-177 microRNA attenuation strategy. Four cassettes, each containing three microRNA target sequences (miR-T), are inserted in the non-coding region of the HSV-1 gene to control its replication.
Attenuation of multiple viral genes by microRNAs found in normal cells prevent viral replication in these tissues
We have shown that the microRNA responsive sequences that we introduced into these key HSV-1 genes lead to the suppression of ONCR-177 replication in cells expressing any of the corresponding microRNAs. Only when all ten microRNAs are absent, a condition which we have found to only occur in tumor cells, can ONCR-177 replication proceed unimpeded.
We also introduced a set of mutations in the gene coding for UL37 that are intended to prevent HSV-1 transport in neurons and to inhibit replication and latency in this cell type. In published in vitro and animal model preclinical studies, HSV-1 containing these mutations was unable to infect the nervous system. In addition, although dosing of unmodified HSV-1 in mice causes neuronal toxicity and hind limb paralysis, as described below, we have demonstrated that our attenuated viruses are well tolerated with no signs of neuronal toxicity.
Designed to optimize the manufacturing of clinical and commercial material
We are focused on developing a manufacturing process for ONCR-177 that is designed to optimize production of clinical-grade material at scale. We have developed a closed, serum-free process with the potential to lead to a high yield and overall low cost of goods. While we currently leverage a commercial CMO for production of our initial batches of clinical material, our process development activities at our approximately 105,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts (41,000 of which is specifically dedicated to processes that are compliant with GMP) are ongoing in an effort to support ONCR-177 and our advancing pipeline of product candidates.
 Preclinical data supporting our clinical development plan
We intend to develop ONCR-177 for patients who have injectable tumors, including patients with tumors that are not typically responsive to immunotherapy, and patients with tumors that do typically respond to immunotherapy but for whom the clinical benefit rate remains low, such as SCCHN and triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC. We dosed our first patient in the Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177 in June 2021 and released preliminary safety and tolerability data in November 2021. Our clinical development plan for ONCR-177 in metastatic tumors includes our ongoing monotherapy evaluation of safety and activity, as well as combination studies to evaluate any additional benefits from PD-1 inhibitors, in addition to evaluation in neoadjuvant settings. These strategies are supported by the preclinical data described below.
mONCR-177 activity in multiple tumor models regardless of sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors or immunotherapy
We assessed anti-tumor activity of mONCR-177 across five syngeneic mouse tumor models representing a diverse range of permissivity to HSV-1 and baseline T cell tumor infiltration. In addition to mONCR-177, many of these studies included ONCR-159, the base vector for ONCR-177 that lacks payloads, as a comparator. In these preclinical experiments, mONCR-177 exhibited greater activity in both the injected tumor and non-injected tumors compared to the same dose of ONCR-159, suggesting that mONCR-177 activity is related, at least in part, to its immunostimulatory payloads.
We tested the following models, which are listed in order of decreasing response to existing immunotherapy approaches, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 antagonists:
▪MC38, a colon carcinoma cell line originally derived from a strain of mouse that is poorly sensitive to HSV-mediated oncolysis. This tumor model represents a T cell infiltrated inflamed hot tumor that responds to systemic PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; however, it represents a higher bar for HSV therapy compared to the A20 model described below. 
 ▪A20, a B cell lymphoma cell line that is moderately to poorly infiltrated with T cells and marginally responsive to single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 or CTLA-4. 
 ▪CT26, a colon carcinoma cell line that grows robustly as syngeneic allografts in mice. The immune contexture of CT26 tumors suggests a heterogeneous assortment of immune cells arrayed in largely balanced proportions of effector and suppressive phenotypes. Importantly, these tumors are resistant to the murine version of T-VEC and are insensitive to anti-PD-L but responsive to CTLA-4 antagonists. 
 ▪B16F10N1, a mouse melanoma model representing an aggressive tumor type characterized as an ‘immune desert’, with a low degree of infiltration of immune cells, most notably T cells. B16F10 tumors or the variant of B16F10 expressing HSV-1 entry receptor Nectin-1, or B16F10N1, do not respond to many forms of immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. Importantly, these tumors are also resistant to the murine version of T-VEC. 
 ▪4T1, a mouse breast carcinoma cancer cell line that when implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically spontaneously metastasizes to internal organs, most notably to the lungs. 4T1 is representative of an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment and is resistant to many types of immunotherapies, including antagonists to immune checkpoints, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, and viral immunotherapies, including HSV. 


As illustrated in the four figures below, MC38, A20, CT26 and B16F10N1 subcutaneous tumors responded to mONCR-177, demonstrating decreased tumor growth and significant regression. In these bilateral flank tumor models, one tumor is typically injected with a viral immunotherapy or placebo, while the tumor on the opposite flank is not injected. In these models, significant tumor growth inhibition and regressions were observed in injected tumors as well as non-injected tumors demonstrating that mONCR-177 has strong abscopal activity. The low levels of abscopal activity in ONCR-159 treated tumors indicate that the abscopal activity of mONCR-177 is dependent on its immunostimulatory payloads. In the 4T1 model of breast cancer, mONCR-177 injection in the subcutaneous tumor led to a significant inhibition of lung metastasis. We believe that the ability to suppress the development of non-injected rapidly growing tumors or metastatic disease is a critical attribute of mONCR-177 indicating the potential to produce systemic anti-tumor immunity. If this activity is also seen in patients, we believe it could provide two noteworthy benefits: not only could it allow patients with known metastatic disease to be treated without requiring metastases to be specifically identified and injected, but it may also lead to the suppression of metastases that are still too small to detect in patients with earlier-stage cancers.
 
Figures 6-9. Activity of mONCR-177 in the A20, MC38, CT26 and B16F10N1 models. Error bars indicate group mean +/- standard error of the mean of tumor volumes for both the right and left flank tumors after intratumoral administration of phosphate-buffered saline, or PBS, control or mONCR-177 into the right flank tumor or the injected tumor. Dosing was repeated every third day for a total number of three doses. Tumors were measured bi-weekly (n=10 in A20, MC38 and B16F10N1 and n=12 in CT26).
We believe these data support the broad development of ONCR-177 as monotherapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors.
mONCR-177 triggers immune activation, a key driver for anti-tumor activity
Through a series of experiments in mice, we observed that most of the anti-tumor effect generated by mONCR-177 is due to its ability to stimulate the immune system. We also observed a contribution to the shrinkage of tumors from mONCR-177’s oncolytic viral activity in injected tumors. These experiments demonstrated increased tumor cell infiltration involving T, NK and dendritic cells and that anti-tumor activity was dependent on T cell and NK cell activity.
We conducted in vivo pharmacology studies in immune competent mice to investigate immune-mediated mechanisms of action of mONCR-177. These studies included histologic (immunohistochemistry), molecular (transcriptional profiling), or cellular (flow cytometry) profiling of injected and non-injected tumors.

As shown in the figure below, significant CD3 T cell infiltration was observed in the oHSV-sensitive A20 tumor model in the injected and non-injected tumors after mONCR-177 treatment compared to PBS control.

Figure 10. T cell infiltration are recruited in injected and non-injected tumors after mONCR-177 intratumoral administration (n=5 per group).
These histology data suggest that mONCR-177 can promote a robust T cell influx into both the injected and non-injected tumors. Additional analysis of transcriptional profile and flow cytometry expanded on this data by showing the recruitment and activation of T cells, NK cells, and classical dendritic cells and the development by transcriptional analysis of a gene signature associated with cytolytic T cells, interferon response and antigen presentation.
Therapeutic efficacy of other viral immunotherapies, including oHSVs, has been shown to be critically dependent upon CD8 T cell and NK cell immune responses. As shown in the figure below, we conducted immune subset depletion studies that demonstrated the dependency of the anti-tumor activity of mONCR-177 in the A20 tumor model on the presence of CD8 T cells and NK cells. When CD8 cells were depleted from mONCR-177-treated animals, the survival benefit in mONCR-177 mice was lost and the outcome of the treated mice became indistinguishable of those of placebo-treated controls. This suggests that mONCR-177-induced CD8 cytotoxic T and NK cells drive most of the anti-tumor activity. The ability of mONCR-177 to lead to stimulation of both the NK cells from the innate immune system and the CD8 T cells from the adaptive immune system is a strong driver for its potential across multiple tumor models.
 

Figure 11. mONCR-177 survival benefit was shown to be dependent on both CD8 T cells and NK cells in the A20 bilateral flank tumor model (n=10 per group).
mONCR-177 treatment leads to the development of immunologic memory and to the development of protective anti-tumor activity as shown in rechallenge studies
Immunologic memory is a central tenet of the adaptive immune response, which is the ability to swiftly, potently, and specifically mount a response against a previously encountered antigen. The memory response is primarily mediated by CD8 and CD4 T cells, a small subset of which differentiate to a long-lived memory cell phenotype after resolution of the initial immune response to particular tumor antigen(s). These memory T cells patrol the body and quickly differentiate to effector cells upon re-encounter with cognate antigen, to mediate efficient eradication of the tumor. Preclinical reports have shown that successful viral immunotherapy can provide long-term protection from tumor rechallenge.
We assessed the ability of mONCR-177 therapy to elicit a long-term protective anti-tumor immunologic memory response in the A20 tumor model. Mice bearing established single flank subcutaneous A20 tumors were dosed intratumorally with either placebo control or mONCR-177. Of the 40 mice treated with mONCR-177, 37 achieved complete tumor regressions followed by significantly prolonged survival compared to placebo control-treated mice (p<0.0001), as shown in the figure below. Subsequently, mice cured of either single or dual flank tumors were observed for three to five months for signs of tumor recurrence and resolution of the primary anti-tumor immune responses, and then rechallenged with A20 tumor cells. Upon challenge in naïve age-matched mice, A20 tumors cells formed rapidly growing tumors whereas mice that had prior complete tumor regressions uniformly rejected A20 cells and survived tumor-free until the end of the monitoring period as shown below.
 
Figure 12. mONCR-177 treatment shown to elicit specific and durable protective immunologic memory in mice bearing A20 with tumors previously completely regressed by mONCR-177 administration (mouse model on left, n=40, mONCR-177 treated group, n=10, PBS group; mouse model on right, n=10 per group).
We observed similar results in mice bearing CT26 tumors that received intratumoral injection of mONCR-177 and that were then subject to similar rechallenge studies involving the CT26 tumor model, as shown below.
 
Figure 13. Treatment with mONCR-177 is shown to lead to long-term survival in the CT26 bilateral mouse model (left) (n=12 per group) and to development of protective immunity as demonstrated by tumor rejection and survival in mice that completely regressed CT26 tumors and were rechallenged by the same tumor (right) (n=5 per group).
We believe these results demonstrate that intratumoral mONCR-177 monotherapy can elicit anti-tumor activity that is accompanied by the development of a specific and durable protective immunologic memory response. Based on these data, we plan to develop ONCR-177 as monotherapy in settings where immune checkpoint inhibitors have little impact.
mONCR-177 activity with systemic anti-PD-1 blocking supports combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors Intratumoral therapy of mONCR-177 enhanced the ability of systemic anti-PD-1 therapy to promote inhibition of tumor growth in the MC38 tumor

model. The inflammatory microenvironment set up by mONCR-177, a replicating oHSV expressing IL-12, FLT3LG, and CCL4, is anticipated to result in compensatory upregulation of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 and CTLA-4. IFN-γ -mediated upregulation of PD-L1 provides a potential mechanism for immune evasion by the tumor that can in turn be circumvented by blockade of the PD-1 pathway, which in the case of ONCR-177 is mediated in the injected tumor via the anti-PD-1 nanobody and in non-injected tumors via systemically administered anti-PD-1 antibody.
As shown in the figure below, systemic anti-PD-1 therapy in the MC38 tumor model resulted in response rates for both the right and left flank tumors, significantly (p<0.0001) different from its isotype control, or lgG2a, confirming the sensitivity of the model to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy. In addition, when administered in combination, mONCR-177 and anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in a significantly enhanced response rate on the non-injected tumor compared to either mONCR-177 (p=0.002) or anti- PD-1 (p=0.003) monotherapy. For the injected tumor, most of the activity was due to mONCR-177 treatment with a trend (p=0.09) of slightly greater activity with combination treatment.
 
Figure 14. Activity of mONCR-177 and anti-PD-1 combination therapy in the MC38 tumor model. CR=complete response (n=10 per group). ns: non-significant; *p<0.05; *** p<0.0001, 2-way ANOVA on Day 18.
These results suggest that whereas mONCR-177 single agent treatment was sufficient to drive most of the observed activity in the injected tumor, the addition of systemic anti-PD-1 therapy augmented activity in tumors that are sensitive to anti-PD-1 therapy. These data support our plans to develop ONCR-177 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with tumors that are sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

mONCR-177 activity in suppressing micro-metastases in the 4T1 model of metastatic breast cancer supports the potential for neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment
We assessed the potential for ONCR-177 to treat micro-metastases in 4T1 based breast carcinoma cancer cell line that when orthotopically implanted spontaneously metastasizes to internal organs, most notably to the lungs. 4T1 is representative of an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment and is resistant to many types of immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and viral immunotherapies, including oHSV-1. As shown in the figure below, treatment with mONCR-177 resulted in a lower number of lung tumor nodules as compared to control PBS or the unarmed ONCR-159.
   
Figure 15. Activity of mONCR-177 in the 4T1 tumor model (n=10 per group).
These results suggest that ONCR-177 may be promising in the setting of neoadjuvant therapy for triple negative breast cancer and perhaps other histologies as well.
mONCR-177 activity is not affected by pre-existing immunity to HSV-1
Intratumoral administration of viral immunotherapies allows large amounts of active agent within the target tumor tissue, while limiting systemic exposure and potential toxicity. This dosing strategy allows efficient viral replication, oncolysis and payload expression within the tumor tissue, thereby increasing the chance to nucleate a potent local and systemic anti-tumor immune response. However, anti-tumor activity after intratumoral administration may potentially be limited by the anti-viral antibody response. Pre-existing exposure to HSV-1 has potential clinical implications since the majority of the world population has been exposed to HSV-1 and presumably has circulating neutralizing antibodies. Clinical data attained with T-VEC suggests that efficacy from intratumoral administration of viral immunotherapies may be unaffected by the anti-viral humoral response.
To examine this issue as it relates to our ONCR-177 program, we evaluated the effects of pre-exposure to HSV-1 and the presence of circulating anti-HSV-1 antibodies on the activity of mONCR-177. As illustrated in the figure below, anti-tumor activity was shown to be similar for mONCR-177 treated naïve and immunized groups.
 
Figure 16. Pre-existing immunity to HSV-1 is shown not to change the anti-tumor activity of mONCR-177 (n=10 per group). CR=Complete response.

Together, these results show that pre-existing immunity to HSV-1 has no apparent effect on either the in situ or abscopal anti-tumor activity of mONCR-177 and further supports the development of ONCR-177 in patients with solid tumors across multiple histologies.
Preliminary data from ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177
 On November 12, 2021, we delivered a poster presentation at SITC’s 36th Annual Meeting, which included preliminary findings from Part 1 of our Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177, including data from 14 patients in the fully enrolled and completed dose escalation cohorts and five patients enrolled in the dose expansion monotherapy portion of the trial, as of November 1, 2021, the cut-off date for the SITC poster submission, in addition to incremental patient data as of November 8, 2021 that was presented live at SITC.
 In the fully enrolled and completed surface lesion dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, ONCR-177 administered to heavily pretreated patients with advanced, injectable solid tumors was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. No treatment-related adverse events exceeded Grade 2, and the most common Grade 1 and 2 adverse events were fatigue, chills, nausea, and mild, dose-dependent cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. No infectious virions were detected in skin swabs, consistent with our expectations with respect to ONCR-177’s safety profile. As summary of treatment-related adverse events experienced by this patient population at the RP2D is shown in the table below.

As of November 1, 2021, seven heavily pretreated patients had been enrolled in the ongoing surface lesion, histology-specific monotherapy expansion cohorts of the trial. As of such date, four of these patients were evaluable, one patient went off study after a single dose and is not evaluable, and two were too early in their treatment course to be evaluable.
 The four evaluable monotherapy expansion patients referred to above are in addition to four evaluable monotherapy escalation patients treated at the RP2D. As of November 8, 2021, after four weeks of monotherapy treatment with ONCR-177 at the RP2D, 4x108 PFU in 4 mL (two doses), three of eight evaluable patients (one with cutaneous melanoma, one with SCCHN, and one with mucosal melanoma) demonstrated clinical benefit as follows:
 •Partial response in a patient with cutaneous melanoma as measured by calipers per RECIST 1.1 (the surface tumor was not measurable by CT scan);
 •Investigator-reported clinical response in a SCCHN patient in injected lymph node after four weeks; and
 •Stable disease in a patient with mucosal melanoma as measured by RECIST 1.1 with improvement in cancer-related symptoms.
 As summary of the data observed for these eight evaluable patients dosed at the RP2D as of November 1, 2021 is shown in the plot below.

CR = complete response; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease; PD = progressive disease
 Several findings from the study thus far suggest immune stimulation of the tumor microenvironment, including mild, dose-dependent CRS in association with increased interferon-g (IFN-g) and T-cell proliferation in blood, as well evidence of tumor PD-L1 expression and immune cell infiltration.
 ONCR-177 clinical development plans
In June 2020, we began enrolling patients in an ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation basket trial of ONCR-177. In November 2021, we presented preliminary findings from Part 1 of the trial, including data from 14 patients enrolled in the completed dose escalation cohorts and five patients enrolled in the dose expansion monotherapy cohorts as of the relevant data cut-off date.
 Our Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177 is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and initial efficacy of ONCR-177 administered alone and in combination with Merck’s KEYTRUDA in patients with advanced and/or refractory cutaneous, subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors or with liver metastases of solid tumors. The primary endpoints in the trial are safety and tolerability both as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA. Secondary endpoints include anti-tumor responses and markers of immune activation. The trial is composed of two primary parts:
 •Part A—Surface lesion dose escalation (to determine RP2D) and tumor-specific dose expansion monotherapy, including in patients with breast cancer, melanoma and head and neck cancer expansion cohorts.
 •Part B—Surface lesion dose expansion combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA, including in patients with third-line TNBC, second-line melanoma and second-line head and neck cohorts.
 The near-term objectives of Part A of the trial are to establish ONCR-177's safety and tolerability and RP2D, as well as to demonstrate monotherapy activity indicative of ONCR-177's anticipated efficacy profile. In addition, we are enrolling and currently dosing separate cohorts of patients with visceral tumors in the liver with the goal of showing additional safety data. We dosed the first patients in the combination arm of the trial (Part B) in late 2021, with the goal of identifying tumor types that are suitable for dosing in randomized registration-directed trials in combination with KEYTRUDA. We plan to report additional surface lesion monotherapy expansion data from Part A and initial surface lesion combination expansion data from Part B in the second half of 2022.
Our Phase 1 trial and early clinical development plan is summarized in the figure below.



Figure 17. Clinical development plan for ONCR-177 in advanced solid tumors. Our dose escalation included four dose levels starting at 1x106 PFU/dose in 1 mL, escalating in log increments up to 1x108 PFU/dose in 1 mL, with the final dose level at 4x108 PFU/dose in 4 mL, which was determined to be the RP2D. We intend to treat tumors with a concentration of 1x108 PFU/mL, up to 4 mL, with volume dependent on tumor size, similar to how talimogene laherparepvec is used today. *Basket study including breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and melanoma.
 Key safety and exploratory biomarkers our Phase 1 trial include ONCR-177 detection in skin swabs, anti-HSV-1 antibodies, ONCR-177 payloads in blood, peripheral inflammatory cytokines, immune infiltration of the tumor and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, or IHC, expression.
 We are also investigating potential clinical trials to assess the ability of ONCR-177 to demonstrate therapeutic benefit in neoadjuvant settings. We believe that the potential ability to induce immune responses without the consequences of systemic toxicities may represent an important mechanism to control tumor growth, prevent the spread of tumors, improve the ability to surgically remove tumors and perhaps reduce the need for surgery. For example, women who present with localized breast cancer suitable for resection, particularly women with TNBC, may be suitable candidates for ONCR-177 therapy. A clinical trial in this treatment setting reported recently by researchers at the Moffit Cancer Center demonstrated complete pathologic responses in five out of nine non-metastatic TNBC patients treated with T-VEC (NCT02779855). We plan to initiate a separate trial or cohort in our Phase 1 trial with ONCR-177 in such neoadjuvant settings, pending the results of our dose expansion trial in patients with advanced tumors, including those with TNBC.
 Potential market opportunity for ONCR-177
Data from the combination arm of our Phase 1 clinical trial (Part B) will inform the indications that we plan to target for registration-directed trials, which are likely to take the form of randomized Phase 2/3 trials designed to demonstrate clinical benefit in high unmet need disease settings, including second and third-line melanoma, third-line TNBC and second and third-line SCCHN.
 We believe that ONCR-177 has the potential to have anti-tumor activity in the broad spectrum of superficial, subcutaneous, and visceral tumors that can be treated by intratumoral injection. Our clinical development plan is focused on two strategies to address unmet medical needs: treatment of refractory patients with advanced diseases that have some but incomplete benefit from existing immunotherapies, beginning with cancers including TNBC and SCCHN, and treatment of tumors typically resistant to immunotherapy, using ONCR-177 to overcome lack of response. We will first focus development on later stage patients with fewer treatment options. Assuming we are able to demonstrate clinical proof of concept, we will then seek to address the problems of early-stage patients in, for instance, newly diagnosed, non-metastatic TNBC and neoadjuvant settings.
 We believe that, because ONCR-177 combines six immunotherapy approaches in one viral immunotherapy while retaining full replication competency and an anticipated favorable safety profile, we should be able to generate robust clinical data, such as durable response rate and survival data. In addition, we believe that if ONCR-177 is approved, its commercial acceptance could benefit from the pioneering efforts of previous oncolytic viruses in that many centers now have experience administering infectious therapeutic agents directly into tumors. We also believe that the commercial acceptance of ONCR-177 could be enhanced by a clinical development plan that will focus on cancers that are unmet medical needs and have been difficult to treat such as SCCHN and TNBC, not primarily on melanoma. We believe that our data also suggest a role for ONCR-177 as both monotherapy and as part of combination therapy.
SCCHN disease background
SCCHN is the sixth most common form of cancer representing a broad category of cancers including tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx that have been grouped anatomically. Each year, SCCHN is diagnosed in more than 900,000 people worldwide, with over 65,000 new cases and more than 14,600 deaths occurring in the United States alone. Five-year survival

for newly diagnosed patients is 65 percent, however, approximately 20 percent patients present with metastatic disease where less than 40 percent of patients survive five years.
Currently available treatments for SCCHN involve combinations of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. These treatments are associated with acute and long-term effects including swallowing dysfunction, dry mouth, and dental problems. Although immunotherapy is active in SCCHN, most patients who are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors will eventually progress and will need additional treatment options. Both nivolumab and pembrolizumab were approved for patients with SCCHN that has progressed on prior platinum therapy in 2016, based on improved ORR. Pembrolizumab was recently approved in 2019 as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent SCCHN. Pembrolizumab in combination with platinum and 5-FU is indicated for all SCCHN patients, whereas pembrolizumab as a single agent is indicated for SCCHN patients whose tumors express PD-L1 combined positive score, or CPS, of greater than or equal to 1. This first line approval is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 trial, where pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival, or OS, compared with the EXTREME regimen (cetuximab with carboplatin or cisplatin plus FU), a standard treatment, as monotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS of greater than or equal to 1) and in combination with chemotherapy in the total study population. Given that the progression free survival, or PFS, for all patients treated in this study was approximately five months, there is still clearly a substantial unmet medical need to bolster immunotherapy after progression from front line therapy in recurrent, unresectable or metastatic non-nasopharyngeal SCCHN. While T-VEC has also been studied in SCCHN, including in combination with pembrolizumab and safety has been manageable, to date activity has been modest compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy. The ONCR-177 trial will provide the opportunity to study a viral immunotherapy in patients eligible for second line therapies for whom pembrolizumab is no longer working, both as monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor such as pembrolizumab.
Breast cancer disease background
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States and worldwide. Approximately 281,550 women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer and approximately 43,600 die from this disease each year. Approximately 31,000 of these women will develop triple-negative breast cancer, and of these approximately 9,000 will progress to stage 3 TNBC. There is significant unmet need, especially in aggressive and relapsed forms of the disease. For example, TNBC tends to grow, spread and recur faster than most other types. Women with TNBC are also more likely to develop metastasis, and these women typically have a poorer prognosis than women with other types of breast cancer due to the lack of available therapies. Meeting the unmet medical needs in TNBC will require both more effective treatment in the non-metastatic setting, and more effective treatment for patients who already have metastases at diagnosis. Immunotherapy is showing promise in both settings, although there remains need for improvement. Additionally, while survival rates are better for hormone receptor positive disease, the subtype which the majority of patients with breast cancer have, for those who recur after standard treatments, new options to improve the immune response are also needed as such patients comprise the majority of poor outcomes in breast cancer.
In March 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval to the first immunotherapy regimen in breast cancer, a combination of nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, for the treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic PD- L1-positive TNBC. The addition of atezolizumab to nab-paclitaxel was shown by Schmid and colleagues to have increased the PFS from 5.5 to 7.2 months for patients whose tumors were PD-L1 positive, although there was no improvement in PFS for patients whose tumors were PD-L1 negative. Similarly, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy was associated with an improvement in PFS of 9.7 months versus 5.6 for chemotherapy alone in patients whose tumors expressed high PD-L1. Pembrolizumab was granted accelerated approval by FDA in November 2020, in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with PD-L1 positive TNBC. The accelerated approval for pembrolizumab in mTNBC was changed to full approval in July of 2021, and pembrolizumab was granted full approval for the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC. While the accelerated approval of atezolizumab for mTNBC has been retracted due to lack of a confirmatory trial, pembrolizumab remains as standard of care for early TNBC (i.e., neoadjuvant) and for mTNBC. We believe that the immunostimulatory activity associated with ONCR-177 has the potential to further enhance this benefit, and may extend the benefit of immunotherapy to PD-L1 negative patients, who are the majority of metastatic TNBC patients, by virtue of increasing inflammation in the tumor microenvironment and upregulating PD-L1.
Up to 95 percent of cases present at an early-stage, and such patients are typically treated with surgery to remove the tumor(s) and possibly some of the lymph nodes. About 25 percent receive a course of chemotherapy prior to surgery in order to shrink a tumor and make it more amenable to resection. This pre-surgical treatment is known as neoadjuvant therapy. Pre-treating patients in the neoadjuvant setting who have early, localized but high risk breast cancer, such as TNBC, with chemotherapy makes tumors smaller, decreases the invasiveness of the surgical resection, and improves long-term outcomes. Neoadjuvant treatment has been established in downstaging large or locally advanced tumors allowing breast-conserving surgery, thereby avoiding mastectomy and has also been shown to improve survival outcomes.

Additional product candidates being developed based on our HSV Platform
We are applying our HSV Platform technology towards the development of a portfolio of other viral immunotherapy product candidates, leveraging the knowledge and experience gained through the development of ONCR-177 and our other programs.
A second program utilizing our HSV platform will specifically target brain cancer, including glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, the most frequent and aggressive form of brain cancer. We intend to leverage our knowledge of microRNA expression to engineer a microRNA attenuation strategy designed to protect healthy brain tissue and select a combination of payloads that address the specific drivers of immune suppression in brain cancer. We have initiated studies to select payloads and micro-RNA targets specific for brain cancer and anticipate candidate nomination in the second half of 2021.
Glioblastoma Multiforme background
GBM, with its typically poor prognosis, represents a particularly acute unmet medical need. In the United States, it is estimated that there are approximately 18,000 newly diagnosed patients each year and 13,000 deaths annually. Newly diagnosed high-grade patients have a median overall survival of 15 to 17 months; the 5-year-overall survival rate is only 5.6%. For patients in which disease recurred the prognosis is much worse, with a median overall survival of 6 to 8 months, while in patients who failed treatment with temozolomide and bevacizumab, or equivalent salvage chemotherapy, overall survival is reported being as short as 3 to 4 months. The current FDA-approved therapies bevacizumab, carmustine wafer, NovoTTF-100A, and lomustine are only marginally effective in extending overall survival in patients with recurrent GBM. The initial results from other companies’ clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 antibodies have been disappointing in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.
Our selectively self-amplifying vRNA Immunotherapy Platform—enabling the repeat intravenous administration of viral immunotherapies
The intravenous administration of viral immunotherapies is an attractive approach for improving the standard of care for many oncology patients because it allows for all tumors in a patient to be treated directly, including micro-metastases that are sometimes difficult to detect and treat. In addition, it allows for potential treatment of certain tumors, such as those of the lung, that are less amenable to repeat intratumoral injection of anti-cancer therapies for safety and feasibility reasons. While multiple viruses have been administered intravenously to treat tumors, they have all been challenged by limited efficacy, likely due to the rapid development of neutralizing antibodies. If neutralizing antibodies could be avoided by virtue of a LNP, which is less immunogenic, this would, in turn, allow the administered therapy to reach tumors and enable repeat intravenous administration of viral immunotherapies.
Our selectively self-amplifying vRNA Immunotherapy Platform is focused on designing and developing viral immunotherapy candidates that can infect tumors while avoiding neutralizing antibodies thereby allowing for repeat intravenous administration. To overcome the limitations caused by neutralizing antibodies, we have developed a novel delivery strategy, in which we engineer a selectively self-amplifying vRNA immunotherapy comprised of a synthetic viral genome encapsulated within an LNP that is intended to be less immunogenic than a natural viral capsid.
 
Figure 18. Diagram comparing a native RNA virus to our selectively self-amplifying vRNA encapsulated in an LNP. vRNA selectively self amplifies in immunosuppressed environments (tumors), producing oncolytic virions that further self amplify.


Once inside the tumor cells, and as is the case with other viral immunotherapies, these genomes replicate and generate a burst of infectious virions that then spread locally and lyse adjacent tumor cells, as illustrated in the figure below.
 
Figure 19. Schematic representation of the mode of action of our synthetic viruses.
Current programs from our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform are based on coxsackievirus A21, or CVA21, and Seneca Valley Virus, or SVV, which have both demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability in early clinical trials conducted by others when virions have been administered intravenously, but where the efficacy was likely limited by the subsequent development of neutralizing antibodies.
We have demonstrated proof of concept of this approach in preclinical models showing that synthetic viral immunotherapies based on both CVA21 and SVV, when administered intravenously, are able to successfully deliver a synthetic viral genome to tumors leading to production of replication competent viruses within the tumors and to tumor growth inhibition. Product candidates to be developed from our selectively self-amplifying vRNA Immunotherapy Platform will utilize shared formulation, regulatory and manufacturing strategies, allowing us to be more efficient in the development of subsequent product candidates.
Our vRNA immunotherapy product candidate selection criteria
In May 2021, we announced the nomination of our first product candidates from our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform, ONCR-021 and ONCR-788. We selected viral genomes for development for our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform based upon two factors, clinical experience with these viruses and technical feasibility:
▪Clinical experience. The foremost factor which drives our selection of viruses for our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform has been clinical experience with these viruses demonstrating their tolerability after intravenous dosing in cancer patients as well as their ability to replicate in tumors. For example, both CVA21 and SVV have been well tolerated in clinical trials after intravenous dosing. Furthermore, these viruses were shown to replicate in patients’ tumors expanding on preclinical observation made for both CVA21 and SVV in animal models indicating that these viruses can lyse tumor cells. We believe these early viral immunotherapy product candidates would likely be further advanced in the clinic if not for the emergence of neutralizing antibodies in the first one to two doses, which limit the ability of subsequent doses to reach tumor sites. 
 ▪Technical feasibility. The identification of, and clinical utility of LNPs, has been driven by the need to intravenously deliver other therapeutics, typically nucleic acids such as RNA, to patients. The recent approval of patisiran, marketed as ONPATTRO® by Alnylam, provides validation that LNPs can be used to safely and effectively deliver nucleic acid therapies to patients through repeat intravenous administration. The synthesis of LNPs for tumor distribution requires the selection of viruses with genome sizes compatible with the loading capacity of an LNP. This has steered our selection of synthetic viruses for product development to oncolytic RNA viruses such as CVA21 and SVV. 


ONCR-021—Our Lead vRNA Immunotherapy Leveraging Synthetic CVA21
 We are developing ONCR-021, a vRNA immunotherapy product candidate for repeat intravenous administration based on CVA21. We selected CVA21 for our first vRNA immunotherapy program based on a number of attractive properties such as clinical safety and tolerability after intravenous dosing in patients, ability to replicate in solid tumors, and its inability to insert into the host chromosome, eliminating the potential of insertional mutagenesis. CVA21 is a picornavirus that has broad tumor tropism, in particular for non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, melanoma, kidney and other solid tumors. We intend to develop ONCR-021 for these indications. In preclinical studies conducted by us and others, treatment with CVA21 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in mouse tumor models including SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells.
We plan to submit an IND for ONCR-021 in mid-2023 to enable clinical development for NSCLC and other cancers such clear cell renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21)
Coxsackievirus A21 is a naturally occurring RNA virus that normally causes mild upper respiratory tract infections in humans. Most studies on coxsackievirus focus on the CVA21 kuykendall strain which is currently in clinical development for NSCLC by Merck as CAVATAK.
In early clinical trials, CAVATAK was well-tolerated when dosed either intratumorally or intravenously and associated with both local and distant tumor responses. In a Phase 2 trial, intratumoral injections of CAVATAK in patients with late-stage melanoma showed durable objective responses in 19.3 percent of patients. Tumor biopsies of treated patients demonstrated the presence of virions and increased infiltration of immune cells in tumors. Clinical trials of intravenously administered CAVATAK also found that neutralizing antibodies developed against the virus after approximately seven days resulting in a limited window in which repeat intravenous doses could potentially be effectively delivered.
ONCR-021 preclinical data
We selected a CVA21 viral strain, referred to as ONCR-CVA21 prior to candidate nomination, that demonstrates more potent oncolytic activity in cancer cell lines including in cells derived from NSCLC than the Kuykendall strain developed by Merck as CAVATAK. In preclinical studies, intravenous dosing of ONCR-021 resulted in tumor shrinkage in two xenograft models of NSCLC, including in the NCI-H1299 as shown in the figure below, which provides preclinical validation for our ONCR-021 program.
 
Figure 20. ONCR-021 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in an NCI-H1299 NSCLC tumor model when dosed intravenously twice every 7 days. ONCR-021 is more active than Synthetic CVA21 based on the Kuykendall (CAVATAK) strain (n=8 per group; p<0.0001 for Synthetic ONCR CVA21 versus PBS control or Synthetic Kuykendall CVA21).
Further preclinical studies of ONCR-021 demonstrated that ONCR-021 was well tolerated in hulCAM-1 transgenic mouse models and in non-human primates with no adverse pathology after single or repeat administration, including no effects on body weight, no adverse elevation of liver enzymes and no pathological findings at exposures above those required for antitumor activity. In addition, ONCR-021 exhibited minimal replication in normal tissues.
 We plan to submit an IND with the FDA for ONCR-021 in mid-2023 to enable clinical development for non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

ONCR-788—Our Lead Viral Immunotherapy Leveraging Synthetic SVV
 In addition to ONCR-021, we are developing ONCR-788 based on Seneca Valley Virus, or SVV, derived from our selectively self-amplifying vRNA Immunotherapy Platform. In this synthetic viral program, we encapsulate the SVV genome into LNPs and are investigating both an unarmed synthetic virus as well as a synthetic virus armed with immunostimulatory transgenes. Following the IND submission for ONCR-021 and pending further resources, we plan to submit an IND for ONCR-788 to enable its development in small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, neuroendocrine prostate and other neuroendocrine cancers, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments.
 We selected SVV based on a number of attractive properties such as clinical safety and tolerability after intravenous dosing in patients, ability to replicate solid tumors, and its inability to insert into the host chromosome, eliminating the potential of insertional mutagenesis. SVV is a picornavirus that has tropism for several human tumor cell lines, in particular those with neuroendocrine features. Cancers with neuroendocrine features include SCLC and treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, or t-NEPC. In preclinical studies led by others, SVV was shown to result in complete and durable eradication of tumors in multiple mouse tumor models including NCI-H446 cells, and in a mouse model of medulloblastoma, SVV was shown to lead to increases in long term survival.
Past attempts at developing SVV monotherapy as a treatment for cancer have demonstrated increases in viral titers and no dose limiting toxicities in patients treated with low doses of virus in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. In these trials there was also evidence of selective viral replication in tumor tissue but not adjacent healthy tissue. These observations are consistent with the ability of SVV to specifically target and replicate in tumor cells and to be well-tolerated after intravenous dosing. In these trials, patients who received SVV also developed neutralizing antibodies, resulting in rapid clearance of the virus from circulation, limiting the ability to deliver repeat doses effectively, which we believe has hampered the therapeutic potential of prior SVV candidates.
ONCR-788 preclinical data
In a preclinical study, an LNP-encapsulated synthetic SVV genome was administered intravenously in a mouse NCI-H446 model of human SCLC. As shown in the first figure below, this synthetic viral immunotherapy led to a significant reduction in tumor growth as compared to PBS and, as shown in the second figure below, the presence of neutralizing antibodies did not have a significant effect on the observed reduction in tumor growth.
 
Figure 21. Synthetic SVV led to tumor growth inhibition in the NCI-H446 SCLC tumor model when dosed intravenously twice every 7 days (n=8 per group). p< 0.0001 SVV versus PBS.


Figure 22. Efficacy of Synthetic SVV is not inhibited by SVV neutralizing antibodies. Synthetic SVV leads to tumor growth inhibition in the NCI-H446 SCLC model when dosed intravenously in presence of either control or neutralizing SVV antibodies (Ab). By contrast, the efficacy of SVV virions (SVV) dosed intravenously is inhibited by SVV neutralizing antibodies (n= 10 per group, p<0.0001 for Synthetic SVV + control Ab, Synthetic SVV + neutralizing Ab and SVV + control Ab vs. PBS or SVV + neutralizing Ab).
After intravenously dosing our LNP-encapsulated synthetic SVV genome, we examined multiple tissues from treated animals for the presence of negative-strand SVV RNA to assess the replication of our synthetic SVV in these tissues. Testing for the presence of negative-strand SVV RNA is a sensitive way of assessing the replication of our synthetic SVV that is based on the fact that SVV is a positive-strand RNA virus that requires a negative-strand RNA as a replication intermediate. As illustrated in the figure below, we found negative-strand RNA only in tumor tissue and not in the liver, demonstrating that the synthetic genomes were delivered to the tumor cells and resulted in the generation of fully infectious virions within the tumor, but did not replicate in tissues outside the tumor.
 Detection of SVV Replicating Genomes

Figure 23. Replicative SVV intermediates, negative-strand RNA, are found in the tumors but not in liver. Each histogram represents a dosed animal. PBS = phosphate-buffered saline control; Neg = non-replicating SVV control; SVV = active, synthetic SVV; cDNA = complementary DNA; (-)ssRNA = negative single strand RNA.
We believe that the ability of SVV to target neuroendocrine tumors as a monotherapy, as well as the potential for adding benefit in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy, could allow us to bring therapeutic benefit to patients for whom there are limited treatment options.

Following the IND submission for ONCR-021 and pending further resources, we plan to submit an IND for ONCR-788 to enable its development in small cell lung cancer, neuroendocrine prostate and other neuroendocrine cancers, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments.
 Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary rights. We compete in the highly competitive markets that address cancer and face significant competition from many sources, including pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and private and public research institutions.
Any viral immunotherapies that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We are focused on developing next-generation viral immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.
We are aware of other companies either marketing or focused on developing competing therapies for the treatment of cancer which generally fall into the following treatment groups:
▪oncolytic viral immunotherapies, including Amgen’s T-VEC, the only FDA-approved oncolytic immunotherapy, which is approved for treating advanced melanoma and is in development for several other indications, and Daiichi Sankyo's DELYTACT, which was approved in Japan for treating malignant glioma;
 ▪other oncolytic viruses that are currently in development by companies such as AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Regeneron, Vyriad, Replimune, Turnstone Therapeutics, Candel Therapeutics and PsiOxus Therapeutics; 
 ▪approved immunotherapy antibodies and immunotherapy agents in clinical development, including antibody agents, bispecific T cell engagers, including those in development by Amgen, and immuno-oncology companies focused on IL-12, such as Ziopharm Oncology, AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb; 
 ▪cancer vaccines, including personalized vaccines and those targeting tumor neoantigens, including neoantigen therapies in development by companies such as BioNTech, Gritstone Oncology and Moderna Therapeutics; 
 ▪cell-based therapies, including CAR T cell therapies, T cell receptor and NK cell therapies; and 
 ▪traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and targeted therapies. 
 With respect to our HSV Platform, we are aware of several other companies developing therapies based on HSV-1. Replimune has advanced assets based on HSV-1 in clinical development in the United States. Additionally, both ImmVira and Candel Therapeutics are advancing HSV-based product candidates in ongoing Phase 1 clinical studies. We have designed ONCR-177 to carry greater numbers of immunostimulatory transgenes than viral immunotherapies that are either currently approved or in clinical development. We have also designed ONCR-177 to maintain full viral replication competency in tumors and to be selectively attenuated in only normal tissues as opposed to both normal and tumor tissues.
With respect to our selectively self-amplifying vRNA Immunotherapy Platform, we are aware that Merck is developing CAVATAK (V937) based on coxsackievirus A21, and we are aware that Seneca Therapeutics is developing therapies based on the Seneca Valley Virus. Additionally, we are aware of other companies that are leveraging self-amplifying RNA in the development of their oncology therapeutics, including Gritstone Bio, Replicate Bioscience, Strand Therapeutics and Chimeron Bio.
 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, are easier to administer or are less expensive alone or in combination with other therapies than any products that we may develop alone or in combination with other therapies, especially if these get to market sooner than our products. These and other third parties also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.
Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Our viral immunotherapy product candidates, if and when marketed, will compete with a number of therapies that are currently marketed or in development that also target cancer but that utilize different mechanisms of action. To compete effectively with these agents, our product candidates will need to demonstrate advantages that lead to improved clinical efficacy and safety compared with these competitive agents. While we believe that our current and future product candidates have the potential to provide potent clinical

antitumor activity as monotherapies, we also plan to test them in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy agents. As such, if and when ultimately marketed, our product candidates may be in combination with checkpoint therapies in addition to other existing cancer therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other biological therapies such as antibodies targeting particular surface receptors. We, therefore, believe that our product candidates, if and when marketed, may in some instances complement rather than compete directly with these existing treatment options.
We expect to face direct and increasing competition from a number of companies that are also seeking to develop cancer therapies based on viral immunotherapies and other ways to stimulate the immune system. We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend, among other things, on our ability to:
▪expeditiously advance the development of our product candidates; 
 ▪design, enroll patients in and successfully complete appropriate clinical trials in a timely fashion; 
 ▪gain regulatory approval for our product candidates in their first indications as well as further indications; 
 ▪establish collaborations and partnerships for the development and marketing of our product candidates; 
 ▪commercialize our product candidates successfully, including convincing physicians, insurers and third-party payors of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates over currently approved therapies; 
 ▪secure and protect intellectual property rights based on our innovations; and 
 ▪manufacture or otherwise obtain and sell commercial quantities of future products to the market. 
 Manufacturing
We have strong in-house process development capabilities for HSV and are currently leveraging external CMOs to implement our in-house developed processes to produce drug substance and drug product. We require that our CMOs produce drug substance and finished drug product in accordance with cGMPs and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. We do not have long-term supply arrangements in place with our CMOs.
We have transferred our processes to commercial CMOs based in the United States for production, labeling, packaging and distribution of our initial batches of clinical material for our ongoing clinical trial of ONCR-177. Through the development of ONCR-177, we have focused on developing a full-scale manufacturing process intended to optimize production of clinical grade material. To this end, we have developed a closed, serum-free process that we expect will result in a high yield and lower overall cost of goods.
We continue to invest in our internal development capabilities to establish in-house manufacturing expertise to support our pipeline. We expect to continue to invest to build proprietary processes that will enable us to be at a competitive advantage when manufacturing product candidates for our HSV and vRNA Immunotherapy Platform programs, and expect that that our product candidates and their components from our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform will be manufactured in-house with minimal reliance on third-party CMOs. In the near term, we intend to continue to rely on third party CMOs from time to time while establishing our own cGMP manufacturing facilities and thereafter for the production of cGMP-grade material in order to secure our supply chain for future production needs. In December 2020, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 88,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space in Andover, Massachusetts to support our advancing pipeline of product candidates. In November 2021, we entered into an amendment to our lease to increase the existing footprint of the facility to a total of approximately 105,000 square feet. We began process development activities at the facility in the second half of 2021 and we expect the facility to be operational in late 2022.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field and other fields that are or may be important for the development of our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
As of February 18, 2022, our patent portfolio consisted of 12 issued U.S. patents, 22 pending U.S. patent applications, and 28 issued foreign patents and approximately 141 pending foreign applications. These patents and patent applications include claims related to our platforms, products, methods, manufacturing processes, and potential future products and developments, with expected expiry dates not earlier than between 2026 and 2042.
HSV Platform
As of February 18, 2022, our patent portfolio related to our HSV Platform includes 14 owned or licensed patent families, which relate generally to the composition of our current and potential future products, and their methods of use.

We solely own seven patent families, which include three issued U.S. patents, four issued foreign patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications, and pending foreign counterparts in Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, and Central and South America. One issued patent, which expires on January 27, 2037, includes claims directed at particular microRNA-attenuated HSV vectors, expression of certain therapeutic payloads, and their methods of use in the treatment of cancer. The other two issued U.S. patents, which expire on June 30, 2037, include claims directed at HSV vectors comprising particular combinations of certain therapeutic payloads. The pending applications include additional claims for microRNA-attenuated HSV vectors including the HSV vector utilized in our ONCR-177 product candidate, HSV vectors encoding particular therapeutic payloads, and their methods of use in the treatment of cancer. Patent applications are pending in these families in more than 17 jurisdictions worldwide, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. Any patents that may issue from these pending applications are expected to expire between 2037 and 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
We have exclusively licensed from the University of Pittsburgh rights in three patent families related to HSV Platform vectors, including certain glycoprotein modifications, a deletion of repeated HSV genes, certain micro-RNA-attenuated HSV vectors, and expression of certain therapeutic proteins from HSV vectors, and their methods of use. These patent families include six issued U.S. patents, 14 issued patents in jurisdictions including Australia, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Singapore and South Africa, three pending U.S. patent applications and 20 pending foreign applications pending in various jurisdictions worldwide, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore. Patents in these families are expected to expire between 2031 and 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also exclusively licensed from Ospedale San Raffaele S.r.l. and Fondazione Telethon rights in one patent family related to micro-RNA attenuation of therapeutic payloads. This family includes six issued patents and seven pending applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2026, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have exclusively licensed from Northwestern University rights in one patent family related to mutations in the UL37 HSV gene. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also exclusively licensed from WuXi Biologics Ireland Limited rights in one patent family related to novel PD-1 antagonist sequences. This family includes seven pending applications in the United States, China, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Europe and Japan. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Finally, we have also exclusively licensed from Gaeta Therapeutics Ltd. rights in one patent family related to local delivery or expression of IL-12 with a systemic checkpoint inhibitor. This family includes five issued patents and six pending applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2032, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Selectively Self-Amplifying vRNA Immunotherapy Platform
As of February 18, 2022, our patent portfolio related to our vRNA Immunotherapy Platform includes eight patent families, which relate generally to synthetic virus compositions and methods of use in the treatment of various cancers.
We solely own these eight patent families. One is a pending provisional application that will convert in December 2022. Three families currently have applications pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. Four families have pending PCT applications that will enter national stages between November 2022 and August 2023. These applications cover the compositions related to polynucleotides, expression of therapeutic payloads, nanoparticle formulations, bispecific payload molecules, diagnostic biomarkers and methods related to their manufacturing and use. We intend to file national phase applications in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. Any patents that may issue from these pending applications are expected to expire between 2039 and 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship

with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future product candidates may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

The obligation to pay royalties under the Northwestern Agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the later of expiry of the last valid claim of the licensed patents that cover such licensed product in such country and the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. The royalty rate is subject to reduction for lack of any valid claim covering such product in a country. We are also obligated to pay certain amounts in the event we grant a sublicense of commercial rights to a third party, which payments vary from a fixed amount in the upper five figures to a low double digit percentage of non-royalty related payments received by us.
The Northwestern Agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon expiry of the applicable royalty obligation for such licensed product in such country. Under the Northwestern Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party. We may terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to Northwestern. Northwestern may terminate the agreement in the event of our insolvency. Additionally, in the event of our failure to use efforts to meet certain diligence milestones, Northwestern may after a specified cure period, elect to either terminate the agreement or render the license non-exclusive. If Northwestern elects to render our license non-exclusive, then all our payment obligations under the agreement will be reduced by a specified percentage.
MPM/UBS Royalty Transfer Agreement
 In March 2016, in connection with the sale of Series A convertible preferred stock, we entered into a royalty transfer agreement with MPM Oncology Charitable Foundation, Inc. and UBS Optimus Foundation, or the Royalty Transfer Agreement. We have agreed to pay a royalty of 1%, in the aggregate, of net sales of our products. Our obligation to pay a royalty expires on a product-by-product and

country-by-country basis upon the later of the 12th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country and expiration of the last valid claim in such country covering such product. The royalty rate is subject to a specified reduction for lack of any valid claim covering such product in a country. The obligation to pay royalties under the Royalty Transfer Agreement shall not apply to any product that would only infringe our intellectual property rights or to any product of an acquirer, assignee of the agreement or merger partner of the company so long as such product does not incorporate any of our pre-acquisition intellectual property.
 WuXi Agreement
In July 2019, we entered into a license agreement with WuXi Biologics Ireland Limited, or WuXi. Under the license agreement with WuXi, or the WuXi Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patents and technology of WuXi to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products for the treatment and prevention of human or animal diseases. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products.
Under the terms of the WuXi Agreement, we made an initial license payment of $0.3 million. Additionally, we are required to pay certain clinical milestone payments for the first product developed in an aggregate amount of $8.0 million and certain commercial milestone payments for the first three products developed in an aggregate amount of $27.0 million per product. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging in the low-single digits. The obligation to pay royalties under the WuXi Agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon expiry of the last valid claim of the licensed patents that cover such licensed product in such country.
The WuXi Agreement expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon expiry of the last valid claim of the licensed patents that cover such licensed product in such country. Under the WuXi Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to WuXi. WuXi may terminate the agreement for any challenge brought by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of the validity, scope, enforceability or patentability of the licensed patents, unless we abandon such challenge, or in the case of our sublicensees, terminate the applicable sublicense.
Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with MSD International GmbH
In July 2020, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement, or the MSD Agreement, with MSD International GmbH, an affiliate of Merck & Co., Inc. (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ONCR-177 combined with Merck’s cancer immunotherapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), a humanized anti-human PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in our Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors. Under the MSD Agreement, we will conduct the trial at our own cost and MSD will contribute its compound for use in the clinical trial without financial obligation to us, except that we may be required to reimburse MSD for the cost of its compound upon certain early termination events. The parties will equally own the clinical data and inventions arising from the combination study, with the exception of inventions relating solely to each party’s compound class. The MSD Agreement will expire upon the delivery of a written report on the results of the study, unless earlier terminated or agreed by the parties.
Each party has the right to terminate the MSD Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. In addition, each party may terminate the agreement upon its own good faith determination that the study may unreasonably affect patient safety or that termination is required for medical, scientific, legal or regulatory reasons, or if an applicable regulatory authority takes any action that prevents the supply of its respective compound for use in the trial. In addition, MSD may terminate the agreement and its supply of KEYTRUDA if MSD believes in good faith that its compound is being used in an unsafe manner in the trial and we fail to promptly incorporate any requested changes into the trial protocol.
Gaeta Agreement
 In November 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Gaeta Therapeutics Ltd., or Gaeta, pursuant to which Gaeta has granted us an exclusive, worldwide sublicense under certain patent rights related to the local delivery or expression of IL-12 with a systemic checkpoint inhibitor to make and have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, export and import any products developed by the Company that would otherwise infringe upon such patent rights when administered in combination with a checkpoint blockade agent in the field of oncolytic viral therapy. Gaeta is the licensee of these patent rights under a separate license agreement with the University of Zurich, or UZH, pursuant to which Gaeta is entitled to sublicense the patent rights and has agreed not to enter into (and to ensure that UZH not enter into) any further sublicense with respect to the patent rights in the field.
 In connection with our entry into the license agreement with Gaeta, we have agreed to pay Gaeta an up-front fee of $0.2 million. We are obligated to make certain additional milestone payments to Gaeta, including a low six-figure payment related to the achievement of a certain patent-related milestone in the United States, and certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments on a product-by-product and indication-by-indication basis, which milestone payments amount to $7.5 million in the aggregate for a given product or indication, with an additional annual payment in the low single-digit millions following regulatory approval of each product. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties on cumulative net sales of all products ranging from the low to mid single-digit millions, up to

$2.5 million in the aggregate for cumulative net sales in excess of a mid-nine digit threshold with additional payments in the mid single-digit millions thereafter upon the achievement of additional net sales milestones.
The license agreement with Gaeta will terminate upon the last to expire of any patent included in the applicable patent rights. Additionally, Gaeta may terminate the agreement for cause upon written notice to us if (i) we directly or indirectly oppose or dispute the grant of letters patent or any patent application within the patent rights, (ii) we are in material breach of the license agreement with Gaeta and fail to remedy such breach within sixty days of Gaeta providing notice thereof in writing, or (iii) we are deemed bankrupt or insolvent or become subject to similar proceedings. We may terminate the license agreement with Gaeta with or without cause upon sixty days’ prior written notice to Gaeta. In the event that UZH terminates the head license with Gaeta, we have the right to become a direct licensee of UZH with substantially the same rights and obligations as it is entitled to under the license agreement with Gaeta, subject to certain qualifications.
 Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Clearance from the FDA is required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. FDA licensure also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biologic Products Development Process
Any biologic product must be licensed by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 ▪submission to the FDA of an application for an IND exemption, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days; 
 ▪approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use; 
 ▪preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 ▪review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; 
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity; 
 ▪potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 ▪payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
Human Clinical Trials Under an IND
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
▪Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 ▪Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 ▪Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA.
Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.

The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Compliance with cGMP Requirements
Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and an annual establishment license fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA.
The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in ten months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Post-approval Requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products.
A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”). The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Violations relating to the promotion of off-label uses may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. Companies, however, may generally share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of a clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources, including healthcare providers, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers conduct clinical research, market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
▪the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other individuals and entities on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation; 
 ▪the federal civil and criminal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, or the FCA, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. 
 ▪the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or the CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and their immediate family members which will be expanded beginning in 2022, to require applicable manufacturers to report such information regarding transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; 
 ▪the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability, among other things, for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 ▪HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information by entities subject to HIPAA, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their respective business associates and their covered subcontractors that access protected health information; and 
 ▪state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to 


healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and drug pricing and/or marketing expenditures; and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if a person becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. New metrics frequently are used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, it may be necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
Health Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the healthcare industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our business are:
▪an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 ▪an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; 
 ▪a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 ▪extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 ▪expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 ▪a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 ▪expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and 
 ▪a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, effective January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. In addition, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case. The United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in this case on November 10, 2020, and is expected to issue a decision sometime this year. Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in

April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 There also has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives.
 For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, individual states in the United States have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that these initiatives, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign government official, government staff member, official or employee of a public international organization, or a political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with healthcare professionals of foreign state-owned or affiliated hospitals, universities, or research institutions. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
