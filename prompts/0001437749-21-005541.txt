Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel treatments for neurological and kidney diseases. Our goal is to use our patented and in-licensed technologies to establish our Company as a leader in the development and commercialization of therapeutic treatments from novel recombinant proteins. Our current focus is on the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We plan to advance DM199, our lead drug candidate, through required clinical trials to create shareholder value by establishing its clinical and commercial potential as a therapy for AIS and CKD.
 
AIS and CKD patients suffer from impaired blood flow in the brain and kidneys, respectively. These patients also tend to exhibit lower than normal levels of endogenous (produced by the body) kallikrein-1 (KLK1), which is a protein produced primarily in the kidneys, pancreas and salivary glands. We believe treatment with DM199 could replenish levels of KLK1, thereby allowing the natural function of kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) to release bradykinin (BK) in the body where and when needed, generating beneficial nitric oxide and prostacyclin, setting in motion metabolic pathways that can improve blood flow (through vasoregulation), dampen inflammation and protect tissues and end-organs from ischemic damage, supporting structural integrity and normal functioning.
 
In the case of AIS, low KLK1 levels are associated with increased risk of stroke and a predictor of stroke recurrence. Our ReMEDy Phase 2 trial in AIS was completed in the first half of 2020 and, in addition to meeting its primary safety and tolerability endpoints, showed a 13.4% absolute decrease in severe recurrent strokes (p=0.03) over the 90-day treatment period. Related to CKD, we completed a Phase 1b single dose, pharmacokinetic (PK) study of DM199 in subjects with moderate CKD during 2019. Subjects received a single dose in the study, after which short-term improvements in the biomarkers Nitric Oxide (NO) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) of 27.2% and 40.6%, respectively, were observed at approximately 24 hours after DM199 administration. Increases in these biomarkers are consistent with the expected mechanism of action for DM199. We believe DM199 has the potential to treat a variety of diseases where restoring healthy function requires sufficient activity of KLK1 and its system, KKS.
 
Today, forms of KLK1 derived from human urine and pancreas of a pig (porcine pancreas) are approved and sold in Japan, China and Korea to treat AIS, CKD, retinopathy, hypertension and related vascular diseases. We believe millions of patients have been treated with these KLK1 therapies and the data from more than 200 published papers and studies support their clinical benefit. However, there are numerous regulatory, commercial and clinical drawbacks associated with KLK1 derived from human urine and porcine pancreas which can be overcome by developing a synthetic version of KLK1 such as DM199. We believe higher regulatory standards and antibody reactions are the primary reasons why KLK1 derived from human urine and porcine pancreas are not currently available and used in the United State or Europe. We are not aware of any synthetic version of KLK1 with regulatory approval for human use in any country, nor are we aware of any synthetic version in development other than our drug candidate, DM199.
 
Kallikrein-Kinin System
 
KLK1 is a serine protease, or protein, produced primarily in the kidneys, pancreas and salivary glands. KLK1 plays a critical role in the regulation of local blood flow and vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels, which decreases vascular resistance) in the body, as well as an important role in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress (an imbalance between potentially damaging reactive oxygen species, or free radicals, and antioxidants in the body).



 
   3

  

KLK1 is involved in multiple biochemical processes. The most well-characterized activity of KLK1 is enzymatic cleavage of low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) to produce bradykinin (BK)-like peptides, collectively known as kinins, which activate BK receptors (primarily BK2R with some BK1R). Activation of BK receptors by kinins sets in motion metabolic pathways that can improve blood flow (through vasodilation), dampen inflammation, and protect tissues and end-organs from ischemic damage. Scientific literature, including publications in Circulation Research, Immunopharmacology and Kidney International, suggests that lower endogenous KLK1 levels in patients are associated with diseases related to vascular disorders, such as kidney diseases, stroke and hypertension. DM199, as a protein replacement therapy, may replenish KLK1 levels to properly activate the KKS to locally produce nitric oxide, prostaglandin and other anti-inflammatory mediators that protect the brain and kidney from damage. By providing additional supply of the KLK1 protein, DM199 treatment could potentially improve blood flow to and reduce inflammation in damaged end-organs, such as the brain and the kidneys, supporting their structural integrity and normal functioning.
 
DM199 (KLK1) and Our Therapeutic Hypothesis
 

We have conducted numerous internal and third-party analyses to demonstrate that DM199 is structurally and functionally equivalent to KLK1 derived from human urine. Specifically, the amino acid structure of DM199 is identical to the human urine form, and the enzymatic and pharmacokinetic profiles are substantially similar to both human urine and porcine derived KLK1. The physiological effects of DM199 on blood pressure, from our completed studies, is similar to that of human urine and porcine-derived forms of KLK1. We believe that the results of this work suggest that the therapeutic action of DM199 will be the same or, potentially, better than that of the forms marketed in Asia.
 
We believe DM199 may provide new treatment options with significant benefits over the current standards of care by offering a therapeutic treatment option to a greater number of patients with the potential for fewer side effects.

Summary of Clinical Results
 
To date, clinical trials have been and/or are being conducted in the United States, Europe and Australia. We believe the clinical data generated to date by DM199 supports the continued development of DM199 as a treatment for AIS and CKD.

● | Our Phase 2 ReMEDy study of DM199 in the treatment of AIS (n=91) met our primary safety and tolerability end points and further demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of participants with severe recurrent stroke was noted in the active treatment group: 1 (2%) patient treated with DM199 vs. 7 (16%) on placebo (p=0.028), with 4 of the 7 resulting in participant death (p=0.28).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additionally, in our Phase 2 ReMEDy study, in a subset of participants (n=46) most closely aligned with the target treatment population for DM199 in our proposed ReMEDy II Phase 2/3 study, participants treated with DM199 (n=25) vs. standard of care supportive therapies and/or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (n=21), the results showed that 36% of participants receiving DM199 progressed to a full or nearly full recovery at 90 days (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS): 0-1), compared to 14% of participants in the placebo group. This represents a 22% absolute increase in the proportion of participants achieving a full or nearly full recovery.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Phase 2 REDUX trial of DM199 in the treatment of CKD caused by rare or significant unmet diseases is ongoing. As of the date of the report 68 participants have been enrolled and no results have been released.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In July 2019, we completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of DM199 in participants with moderate or severe CKD caused by Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The study was performed mainly to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of three dose levels of DM199 (3, 5 and 8 µg/kg), administered in a single subcutaneous (SC) dose. In August 2019, we announced the successful completion of this study including positive pharmacodynamic (PD) results which were consistent with the proposed mechanism of action for DM199.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In all studies, DM199 was shown to be safe and well tolerated with no DM199 related serious adverse events or study discontinuations. The primary adverse events noted in our studies include constipation, nausea and headache, all of which resolved without medical intervention.

For patients with chronic kidney disease, studies have shown that KLK1 excretion, or levels of KLK1 in the urine, were significantly decreased. This decrease was more pronounced in patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis, as illustrated in the graph below.

Our Strategy
 
Our long-term goal is to become a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of recombinant proteins for the treatment of severe and life-threatening diseases. We seek to identify and select, for development and partnership, recombinant proteins with novel mechanisms that have biological properties with broad applicability. Once we have selected a class of recombinant proteins, we apply their biological properties to clinical settings with unmet needs. We evaluate opportunities based on the estimated development timeline, cost, regulatory pathway and commercial opportunity. After identifying suitable molecules for clinical development, we intend to mitigate development risk by maintaining a diversified and broad clinical pipeline, analyzing data to determine the potential of each program and entering into development collaborations with industry-leading companies.

AIS Background and Disease Pathology
 
Acute Ischemic Stroke Background
 
Stroke is characterized by the rapidly developing loss of brain function due to a blockage of blood flow in the brain. As a result, the affected tissues of the brain becomes inactive and may eventually die. Strokes can be classified into two major categories: AIS and hemorrhagic stroke. AIS is characterized by interruption of the blood supply by a blood clot (ischemia), while a hemorrhagic stroke results from rupture, or bleeding, of a blood vessel in the brain. Risk factors for stroke include, among other things, advanced age, hypertension (high blood pressure), previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, atrial fibrillation, physical inactivity and obesity.
 
More specifically, with respect to an ischemic stroke, at the site of a blood flow blockage in the brain, there exist two major ischemic zones - the core ischemic zone with nearly complete loss of blood flow (blood flow below 10% to 25%), and the surrounding ischemic penumbra, a rim of mild to moderately ischemic tissue surrounding the core ischemic zone. Within minutes, the significant lack of blood flow in the core ischemic zone deprives these cells of glucose and oxygen which rapidly depletes energy stores and triggers the loss of ion gradients, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death, or apoptosis. The ischemic penumbra zone, however, may remain viable for several hours via collateral arteries that branch from the main occluded artery in the core ischemic zone. Unfortunately, the penumbra is at great risk of delayed tissue damage due to inflammation which may also lead to neuronal cell death. As time goes on, a lack of blood flow in the core ischemic zone (infarct) may lead to fluid buildup (edema) and swelling which creates intracranial pressure. This pressure on the brain leads to tissue compression resulting in additional ischemia. Additional events in AIS include vascular damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium, loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels and inflammation. A stroke can lead to permanent damage with memory loss, speech problems, reading and comprehension difficulties, physical disabilities and emotional/behavioral problems. The long-term costs of stroke are substantial, with many patients requiring extended hospitalization, extended physical therapy or rehabilitation and/or long-term institutional or family care. However, provided the extended window of viability in the penumbra, next generation stroke therapies are being developed to protect valuable brain tissue during the hours to a week after a stroke.

Unmet Medical Need in AIS
 
According to the World Health Organization, each year approximately 1.7 million in the U.S., Europe and Japan and approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, of which 5.0 million will die and 5.0 million will be permanently disabled. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approximately 87% of all strokes are ischemic in nature, a blockage of blood flow in/to the brain. We believe that stroke represents an area of significant unmet medical need and a KLK1 therapy (such as DM199) could provide a significant patient benefit, in particular given its proposed treatment window of up to 24 hours after the first sign of symptoms. Currently, the only FDA-approved pharmacological intervention for AIS is tPA, which must be given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Treating patients with tPA during this time window can be challenging because it is difficult to determine precisely when symptoms began and a patient must undergo complex brain imaging before treatment to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, a ruptured blood vessel causing bleeding within the brain. Mechanical thrombectomy, a procedure in which the clot is removed using catheter-based tools, is also available to certain patients. Despite the availability of these treatments, we believe they are relevant to approximately 10% of ischemic stroke patients due to the location of the clot, the elapsed time after the stroke occurred or other safety considerations. Thus, we believe DM199 may offer significant advantages over the current treatment options in that it fills a serious, unmet need for patients who cannot receive tPA or mechanical thrombectomy. Additionally, we believe DM199 may also offer a complimentary follow-on treatment for patients who initially receive tPA or mechanical thrombectomy treatments by enabling sustained blood flow improvements to the brain during the critical weeks and months after a stroke, reducing the risk of stroke recurrence.
 
Specifically with respect to the United States, and according to the CDC:
 

● | Every year in the United States, approximately 795,000 people experience a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Approximately 610,000 of these are first events and approximately 25%, or 185,000, are recurrent stroke events.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately one of every 20 deaths in the United States is caused by stroke and is the fifth leading cause of death. On average, someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds and someone dies from a stroke every four minutes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability and reduces mobility in more than half of stroke survivors age 65 and over.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Risk of having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for African Americans as for Caucasians, and African Americans have the highest rate of death due to stroke.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Stroke costs in the United States, as reported by the American Heart Association, averaged nearly $46 billion in 2014 and 2015, including the cost of health care services, medications and lost productivity.

Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment Options
 
DM199 – Our Novel Solution for the Treatment of AIS
 
We believe DM199 has the potential to preserve “at risk” brain tissue by increasing cerebral blood flow, establishing better collateral circulation, decreasing inflammation, reducing cell death, or apoptosis, and facilitating improved blood flow to at-risk brain tissue in the ischemic penumbra. Immediate actions include activation of the KKS to release nitric oxide and improve microcirculation in ischemic tissue along with improvements in the balance between blood flow and brain activity (neurovascular coupling). Longer term (days following the stroke) actions include the restoration of the blood brain barrier through increases in regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subpopulation of regulatory T cells that modulate the immune system and prevent pathologic autoimmune response, and inhibition of neuronal cell death, or apoptosis.
DM199 Acute Ischemic Stroke: Proposed Mechanism
 

In January 2019, we published a paper titled “Human Tissue Kallikrein in the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke” in the peer reviewed journal, Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders. The paper reviews the scientific literature covering the biochemical role of KLK1 and presents the mechanistic rationale for using KLK1 as an additional pharmacological treatment for AIS. In addition to the biochemical mechanism of KLK1, the review highlights supporting results from human genetics and preclinical animal models of brain ischemia. It also reviews published clinical results for treatment of AIS by a form of KLK1 that is isolated from human urine. This form has been approved for post-infarct treatment of AIS in China and data has been published from clinical trials involving over 4,000 patients. The paper offers a series of testable therapeutic hypotheses for demonstrating the long-term beneficial effect of KLK1 treatment in AIS patients and the reasons for this action.
 
   10

  

We are developing DM199 to treat AIS patients with a therapeutic window of up to 24 hours after the first sign of symptoms, well beyond the current window of up to 4.5 hours for tPA, thereby filling a large unmet need for those patients who cannot receive tPA under the currently available treatment window of tPA. This important attribute could potentially make therapy available to the millions of patients worldwide who currently have limited treatment options.
 
Supporting Data from the Use of Urine-derived KLK1 for the Treatment of AIS in China
 
In China, Kailikang is approved and marketed by Techpool Bio-Pharma Inc., a company controlled by Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. Ltd. Kailikang has been approved for the treatment of AIS in China. We believe the initial treatment window is up to 48 hours after stroke symptom onset. Based on IQVIA data, other publications and our own internal analysis, we estimate that over 600,000 stroke patients have been treated with Kailikang in China since its approval in 2005. More than 50 published clinical studies, covering over 4,000 stroke patients, have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Kailikang treatment in AIS including improvements in standard stroke scores, blood flow and biomarkers of inflammation. According to a publication in the China Journal of Neurology, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 446 patients treated with either Kailikang or a placebo with initial treatment administered up to 48 hours after symptom onset showed significantly better scores on the European Stroke Scale and Activities of Daily Living at three weeks post-treatment and after three months using the Barthel Index:
 

Additionally, a comprehensive meta-analysis covering 24 clinical studies involving 2,433 patients published in the Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine concluded that human urinary KLK1 appears to ameliorate neurological deficits for patients with AIS and improves long-term outcomes, though a few treated patients suffered from transient hypotension.
 
Furthermore, in a retrospective study covering 300 consecutive AIS patients, published in Brain and Behavior March 2018, patients treated with human urinary KLK1 experienced 39% (p=0.009) fewer recurrent strokes within one year.

CKD Background and Disease Pathology
 
Chronic Kidney Disease Background
 
CKD is characterized by a progressive decline in overall kidney function as measured by the eGFR, a test used to evaluate blood flow through the kidneys, and albuminuria, a marker for glomerular injury which is a measure of the amount of albumin protein excreted in your urine and an indicator for how well the kidneys are filtering excess fluid and waste products out of your blood. As glomerular filtration decreases, the body’s ability to continue to regulate its many functions, including the elimination of metabolic waste, is lost and ultimately, may result in severe physiologic consequences. Among multiple underlying causes, CKD often begins with an increase in blood glucose which leads to the thickening of the glomerular membrane, known as fibrosis. As the kidney function becomes impaired, eGFR decreases and albuminuria increases. Increased albuminuria means that abnormal amounts of protein are released into the urine collecting tubules of the kidney through damaged capillary pores in the glomerular floor. Additionally, increased blood glucose leads to increased blood pressure, elevated reactive oxygen species, advanced glycation end product formation (harmful compounds that are formed when protein or fat combine with sugar in the bloodstream) and inflammation. As these continue, structural components of the kidney begin to collapse, resulting in cell ischemia and cell death. As the renal damage continues, a progressive thickening of the glomerular basement membrane is seen along with continued pathological changes in the cells and inflammation. Early stages of CKD are characterized as microalbuminuria (small amounts of protein leak into the urine). Late stages are characterized as macroalbuminuria (large amounts of protein leak into the urine). The rate of decline depends on a number of factors including the type of diabetes, genetic predisposition, glycemic controls and blood pressure. At the final stages of CKD, the kidneys fail completely and dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.
 
Unmet Medical Need in CKD
 
CKD is a widespread health problem that generates significant economic burden throughout the world:
 

● | According to the National Kidney Foundation, 37 million Americans have CKD and millions of others are at increased risk.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary causes of CKD are diabetes (Type 2 and Type 1) and hypertension. The Medical Clinics of North America estimates that over 40% of those with Type 2 diabetes and 20% of those with Type 1 diabetes will eventually develop CKD, making it one of the more common risks for diabetics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients with CKD are at greater risk for hypertension and heart disease.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently, there is no cure for CKD and treatment primarily involves management of the symptoms of the disease. Blood pressure medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), are often prescribed to control hypertension, and hopefully, slow the progression of CKD. Recently sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) have received approval to expand their label to treat diabetic kidney disease to reduce the rate of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, according to the National Kidney Foundation, many of these patients continue to show declining kidney function and 3.6% of the overall population has a lifetime risk of developing ESRD, where dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed. We believe DM199 offers a potentially novel approach for the treatment of CKD because KLK1 protein plays a vital role in normal kidney function. Since patients with moderate to severe CKD often excrete abnormally low levels of KLK1 in their urine, we believe that DM199 may potentially prevent or reduce further kidney damage by increasing levels of KLK1 and restoring the protective KKS to regulate the production and release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin.
 
   12

  

DM199 – Our Novel Solution for the Treatment of CKD
 
We believe DM199 has the potential to offer meaningful therapeutic benefits for CKD patients. We believe that the KLK1 protein plays a vital role in maintaining normal kidney function, promoting the production of nitric oxide, prostacyclin and other anti-inflammatory mediators which are important for kidney health and integrity. Patients with moderate to severe CKD often excrete abnormally low levels of KLK1 in their urine, leading to the hypothesis that a KLK1 deficit contributes to disease progression. We believe that DM199, as a protein replacement therapy, can potentially replenish KLK1 levels and properly activate the KKS enabling or improving the production of nitric oxide, prostacyclin and other anti-inflammatory mediators which may protect the kidney from damage and possibly restore normal kidney function. In related preclinical testing, DM199 treatment in an animal model of Type 1 diabetes, a known cause of CKD, delayed the onset of the disease, attenuated the degree of insulitis (inflammation in the insulin producing islet cells of the pancreas) and improved pancreatic beta cell mass in a dose-dependent manner by increasing Tregs.
 
By providing additional KLK1, DM199 has the potential to:
 

● | Improve blood flow through the kidney by restoring proper regulation of blood flow through veins, arteries and especially capillaries (vasoregulation);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support the structural integrity of the kidney by reducing scar tissue formation (fibrosis), oxidative stress, and inflammation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Activate mechanisms that upregulate Tregs, improve insulin sensitization, glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, and lower blood pressure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Further supporting the hypothesis that an intact KKS is critical for normal kidney function, a series of observational studies published in Immunopharmacology showed the amount of KLK1 released into the urine appears to be inversely correlated with the severity of disease in patients with CKD. Urinary KLK1 excretion was decreased in patients with both mild (not requiring dialysis) and severe (kidney failure/hemodialysis) renal disease compared to controls. Decreases in urinary KLK1 activity were seen especially when the reduction was associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate.
 
DM199 treatment is intended to directly replenish KLK1 levels to maintain, or possibly restore, kidney function. Current treatment options, especially ACEi drugs, primarily slow the rate of decline in kidney function and are associated with side effects. Importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that part of the beneficial effect of ACEi drugs involves preventing the normal breakdown of BK leading to substantial increases in BK levels throughout the body. However, these effects can be unregulated and ACEi drugs therefore can generate excessive BK where it is not needed, potentially leading to side effects such as persistent cough, angioedema (swelling of skin and tissue) and hyperkalemia (abnormally high potassium levels that can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death). We believe DM199 treatment could potentially restore normal KLK1 levels allowing the KKS to perform its normal physiological processes and release BK when and where it is needed, avoiding these side effects.
 
   13

  

We intend to seek approval for use of DM199 as a novel and ground-breaking therapy for CKD. Protein replacement therapy with DM199, through the activation of the KKS, may complement the renin-angiotensin system, primarily targeted by ACEis and ARBs, and may potentially improve the function of the diseased renal system by improving blood flow and vasodilation, as well as reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.
 
Supporting Data from the Use of Porcine-Derived KLK1 for the Treatment of CKD in Japan, China and Korea
 
KLK1 derived from porcine pancreas is currently used to treat CKD in Japan, China and Korea. Specifically, porcine KLK1 is also used to treat hypertension and retinopathy. Based on data published by the data analytics company IQVIA and our own internal analysis, we estimate that millions of patients have been treated with porcine KLK1 for these and other vascular diseases. We have identified 17 clinical papers, published in China and Germany supporting the therapeutic activity of porcine KLK1 in CKD patients, whether given alone or in combination with an ARB or an ACEi. These unblinded studies involve treatment durations ranging from a few weeks up to six months and report improvement in kidney disease based on decreased urinary albumin excretion rates and other clinical endpoints of kidney disease.
 

We also identified one 90-patient study in which porcine KLK1 given in combination with an ARB restored normal kidney function.

Our Competition and Current Treatments for Acute Ischemic Stroke and Chronic Kidney Disease 
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapidly advancing technologies that focus on rapid development of proprietary drugs. We believe that our DM199 product candidate, development capabilities, experience and scientific knowledge provide us with certain competitive advantages. However, we face significant potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for competitive products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effectively marketed and sold than any products we may commercialize, thus limiting our market share and resulting in a longer period before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our DM199 product candidate.
 
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These activities may lead to consolidated efforts that allow for more rapid development of competitive product candidates.
 
We also compete for staff, development and clinical resources. These competitors may impair our ability to recruit or retain qualified scientific and management personnel, our ability to work with specific advisors, or our ability to work with clinical contract organizations due to conflicts of interest or capacity constraints, and may also delay recruitment of clinical study sites and study volunteers, impeding progress in our development programs.
 
   15

  

We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government or other third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more effective or less expensive than any products that we may develop.
 
Acute Ischemic Stroke
 
Currently, there is one approved pharmaceutical treatment for AIS. That treatment is tPA (marketed under the brand name Activase®), and its therapeutic window is limited to up to 4.5 hours after the AIS. There are, however, a number of companies that are actively pursuing a variety of approaches to develop pharmaceutical products for the treatment of AIS including, among others:

● | Stem cells (Athersys, Inc.)
--+----------------------------


● | tPA extended treatment window (Genentech)
--+------------------------------------------


● | Cerebral edema (Biogen Inc.)
--+-----------------------------


● | Anti-inflammatory and clot dissolving (Biogen Inc.)
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Cell protection and anti-inflammation (ZZ Biotech LLC)
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Inhibiting platelet aggregation (Acticor Biotech SAS)
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
There is a large unmet therapeutic need for AIS treatments that can be administered beyond the 4.5-hour time window of tPA. With this large unmet therapeutic need, there is significant competition to develop new therapeutic options. New therapeutic options in development include tissue protection focused therapies (deliverable from hours to days after the stroke) that preserve and protect brain cells beyond the tPA therapeutic window. Currently, the most advanced treatments involve the mechanical removal of blood clots in arteries supplying blood to the brain through sophisticated catheter-based approaches, or mechanical thrombectomy. According to published research, use of mechanical thrombectomy is growing and the window of time after a stroke where the procedure can be used is widening. The goal is to provide treatment options for the vast majority of AIS patients who do not receive hospital care early enough to qualify for tPA therapy. We believe there is a very significant market opportunity for a drug that has a therapeutic window beyond that of tPA and is able to obtain regulatory approval.
 
Chronic Kidney Disease
 
CKD is primarily associated with diabetes and hypertension along with other disease states. In the United States, we are aware of only two currently approved treatments for CKD. These treatments include an ACEi (marketed under the brand name Captopril®) which is approved for the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Type 1 diabetes and a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (marketed under the brand name INVOKANA® and Farxiga®) which is approved for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a type of CKD, in adults with mild to moderate Type 2 diabetes and macroalbuminuria.
 
There are several pharmaceutical products for the treatment of CKD currently in clinical development, some of which include:
 

● | Mineralcorticortisteroid receptor agonist (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals LLC)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Chymase inhibitor (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals LLC)
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Transient receptor potential canonical channel 5 (Goldfinch Bio)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | CCR2 receptor antagonists (ChemoCentryx, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Oxidative stress, cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors (Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   16

  


● | Glycosylation inhibitors (Glycadia, Inc. aka Glycadia Pharmaceuticals)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Endothelin A receptor antagonists (Chinook therapeutics, Inc.)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cyclin nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Pfizer Inc.)
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aldosterone receptor antagonists (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nitric oxide enzyme inhibitor (GenKyoTex SA)
--+---------------------------------------------


● | Nitric oxide (Cyclerion/Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, there are several pharmaceutical products specifically for the treatment of IgAN currently in clinical development, some of which include:
 

● | Local corticoid steroid gut immune system (Calliditas Therapeutics AB)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dual acting ARB and endothelin receptor antagonist (Travere Therapeutics, Inc.)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Antibody MASP-2 inhibitor (Omeros Corporation)
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Small-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B (Novartis AG)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Small-molecule inhibitor Nrf2 activator/NFkB inhibitor (Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Current treatment strategies for CKD include the strict control of high blood pressure and high blood sugar. The ACEi drug Captopril® is approved for use in patients with CKD due to Type 1 diabetes and both ACEi and ARBs are widely prescribed to slow the progression of CKD. Furthermore, the treatment with ACEi has been linked to hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium levels), which increases the risk for abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death. In fact, two clinical trials investigating the use of ACEi and ARB combination therapy in kidney disease were stopped prematurely because participants developed hyperkalemia. The added complication of hyperkalemia results in patients receiving smaller, or suboptimal, doses or patients being untreated because they cannot tolerate the treatment. Additional side effects with ACEi treatment are angioedema (swelling of skin tissue) and persistent cough.
 
INVOKANA® (canagliflozin) is approved for use in patients to reduce the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with Type 2 diabetes and DKD with a certain amount of protein in the urine. Potential side effects of INVOKANA include lower limb amputations, dehydration, diabetic ketoacidosis and genital mycotic infections. Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is approved for use in patients to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Potential side effects of INVOKANA include dehydration, diabetic ketoacidosis and genital mycotic infections.
 
DM199 treatment is intended to directly replenish KLK1 levels, maintaining or potentially restoring kidney function. Current treatment options, especially ACEi drugs, only partially restore kidney function and are associated with high-risk side effects. ACEi drugs can generate excessive BK where it is not needed, potentially leading to side effects such as cough and angioedema. DM199 treatment may potentially allow KLK1 to follow its normal physiological processes and release BK when and where it is needed, avoiding these side effects.
 
DM199 Clinical Studies
 
AIS Phase 2/3 ReMEDy 2 Study
 
In December 2020, we received written responses from the FDA following a Type B Pre-IND meeting request that we submitted in October 2020 regarding our development plan for DM199 in the treatment of AIS. In the FDA’s written responses to the questions we provided, the FDA agreed with our proposals regarding key elements of a Phase 2/3 trial for DM199 in patients with AIS, including plans for an adaptive trial design with a primary endpoint based upon the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90 and acknowledged that, provided the study results qualify, a single trial may support a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission. Additionally, based upon the clinical and preclinical testing performed to date and currently in process, the FDA did not recommend any additional studies in preparation for an IND submission and initiation of our planned Phase 2/3 trial. We intend to file an IND for this study by the end of the first quarter of 2021.
 
   17

  

We believe that the feedback received from the FDA provides us a well-defined regulatory pathway and we are preparing an IND submission to initiate an adaptive Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This study is intended to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of DM199 in patients with mild to moderate AIS. The study is expected to enroll approximately 300 to 350 male and female subjects age 18 and over. Enrolled participants must have a diagnosis of mild to moderate AIS (NIHSS scores between 5 and 20), and present within 24 hours of symptom onset. Current plans for the study are to exclude patients with large vessel occlusions, which are eligible for treatment with mechanical thrombectomy, and/or patients eligible for tPA. We believe that our targeted study population represents approximately 80% of all AIS patients. As currently planned, study participants will be dosed with either DM199 or placebo over 21 days with the primary endpoint measured at day 90. In order to increase the probability of a successful outcome, we also intend to propose conducting an interim analysis with the potential to adjust the study sample size to ensure proper statistical powering, if necessary. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2/3 trial will be the modified Rankin Scale. Secondary endpoints are anticipated to include stroke recurrence and standard stroke measures, including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index.
 
AIS Phase 2 ReMEDy Study
 
Enrollment in the ReMEDy study began in February 2018 and concluded in October 2019. We enrolled 92 participants to assess DM199 in the treatment of participants who experienced an AIS. The study drug (DM199 or placebo) was administered as an IV infusion within 24 hours of stroke symptom onset, followed by subcutaneous injections later that day and once every 3 days for 21 days. The study was designed to measure safety and tolerability along with multiple tests designed to investigate DM199’s therapeutic potential including standard functional stroke measures and stroke recurrence assessed at 90 days post-stroke and certain plasma-based biomarkers. Standard functional stroke measurements include the Modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the Barthel Index and C-reactive protein, a measure of inflammation. Positive top-line results, including the achievement of primary safety and tolerability endpoints and no DM199-related serious adverse events, were announced in May 2020. In addition to meeting its primary safety and tolerability endpoints, a statistically significant 86% (P=0.028) relative reduction in the number of participants with severe recurrent strokes was observed in the active treatment group (N=1, 2.2%) compared to placebo (N=7, 15.6%), a potentially transformative outcome given that approximately 25% of the 795,000 strokes occurring each year in the United States are recurrent strokes.
 
When participants treated with mechanical thrombectomy are excluded from the study data set, representing the group of participants most closely aligned with the target treatment population for DM199 in our proposed Phase 2/3 ReMEDy II study, a positive therapeutic effect was demonstrated. As shown in the table below, when evaluating the participants treated with DM199 (n=25) vs. standard of care supportive therapies and/or tPA (n=21), the results showed that 36% of participants receiving DM199 progressed to a full or nearly full recovery at 90 days (NIHSS: 0-1), compared to 14% of participants in the placebo group. This represents a 22% absolute increase in the proportion of participants achieving a full or nearly full recovery. Additionally, subject deaths decreased from 24% in the placebo group to 12% in the active therapy group, a 50% relative reduction. Note that the number of subjects in these subsets was insufficient for statistical significance.

DM199 vs. Standard of Care Supportive Therapies and/or tPA
 

 | NIHSS Outcomes at 90 Days
---------------+--------------------------
 | 0-1 | 2-8 | ≥ 9 | Death
Placebo (n=21) | 14% | 57% | 5% | 24% 
DM199 (n=24) | 36% | 36% | 16% | 12% 

 
Further, in reviewing evaluable participants (n=91), improvements in the following biomarkers were observed in participants treated with DM199, which we believe are consistent with the DM199 mechanism of action:
 

● | Increased NO (+105%) and PGE2 (+54%) were observed at day 22 vs. baseline (p<0.05). Placebo group was not statistically significant vs. baseline (p>0.05). These changes noted in the active treatment group did not reach statistical significance compared to placebo.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) of (-70%), a blood marker of inflammation, at 90 days. CRP decreased significantly vs. baseline (p<0.05), but was not statistically significant vs. placebo. The change in the placebo group was not statistically significant vs. baseline (p>0.05).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction in elevated glucose levels in participants with Type 2 diabetes (n=30), as defined by a blood glucose level >7 mmol/l (n=14), an average decrease of 1.9 mmol/l (p=0.06) in blood glucose levels of participants on active therapy was observed at day 22. In comparison, participants in the placebo group (n=16) showed an average increase of 0.08 mmol/l (p=0.94) at day 22.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Changes in the eGFR, a measure of kidney function, were also analyzed in participants with eGFR <70 mL/Min/1.732 at baseline, which indicates the presence of CKD. Participants receiving DM199 exhibited a marked increase in eGFR at days 22 (last dose) and 56 (34 days post-treatment), as shown in the table below. eGFR at day 22 increased by at least 2 mL/Min in 77% of DM199 participants compared to 20% in placebo (p=0.007).
 

 | eGFR Mean Δ from Baseline (mL/Min/1.732)
------------------+-----------------------------------------
 | Day 22 (Last Dose) | Day 56 (Off Treatment)
Placebo | +0.84 (n=15) | -0.24 (n=12) 
DM199 | +7.5 (n=13) | +5.8 (n=12) 
Group Difference | +6.6 | +6.1 

 
We believe these findings from our Phase 2 ReMEDy trial,which are consistent with Chinese data on the urine-derived form of KLK1, provide a signal that DM199 appears safe and well tolerated and may have promise as a new tool for physicians who have limited options for the treatment of patients suffering AIS and may also mitigate the adverse impact of ischemic stroke on kidney function.

CKD Phase 2 REDUX Study
 
In October 2019, the FDA accepted our Phase 2 clinical trial protocol for the treatment of CKD caused by rare or significant unmet diseases. The trial named REDUX, Latin for restore, is a multi-center, open-label investigation of approximately 90 participants with mild or moderate CKD (Stage II or III) and albuminuria, who are being enrolled in three cohorts (30 participants per cohort). The study is being conducted in the United States at 14 sites and is focused on participants with CKD: Cohort I is focused on non-diabetic, hypertensive African Americans with Stage II or III CKD. African Americans are at greater risk for CKD than Caucasians, and those African Americans who have the APOL1 gene mutation are at an even higher risk. The study is designed to capture the APOL1 gene mutation as an exploratory biomarker in this cohort. Cohort II is focused on participants with IgAN. Cohort III, which was added after the completion of our August 2020 public offering, is focused on participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with CKD, hypertension and albuminuria. The study will evaluate two dose levels of DM199 within each cohort. Study participants will receive DM199 by subcutaneous injection twice weekly for 95 days. The primary study endpoints include safety, tolerability, blood pressure, albuminuria and kidney function, which will be evaluated by changes from baseline in eGFR and albuminuria, as measured by the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio. Participant enrollment and dosing for this study commenced in December 2019.
 
As of March 1, 2021, we had enrolled 68 subjects, including 15 African American subjects into Cohort I, 21 subjects with IgAN into Cohort II and 32 subjects with Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and albuminuria into Cohort III of the REDUX study.  Due to actions implemented at our clinical study sites to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to experience slower than expected enrollment in the first two cohorts of the REDUX trial.  We believe this is due to the reduction or suspension of activities at our clinical study sites as they address staff and patient safety concerns and patient concerns related to visiting clinical study sites in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, with the significant declines in new COVID-19 cases and the anticipated availability and effectiveness of vaccines, we currently anticipate completion of Cohort I and Cohort II in the second half of 2021.  The enrollment of Cohort III was much more rapid completing in December 2020, which is likely due to the large population of potential subjects.  We currently expect topline results from Cohort III to be available in the second quarter of 2021.
 
CKD Phase 1b
 
In July 2019, we completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of DM199 in participants with moderate or severe CKD caused by Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. We initiated dosing patients in this study in February 2019. The study was performed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of three dose levels of DM199 (3, 5 and 8 µg/kg), administered in a single subcutaneous dose, as well as the evaluation of safety, tolerability and secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. The study results demonstrated that at the 3µg/kg dose level, the PK profiles were similar between moderate and severe CKD patients, and consistent with healthy subjects (normal kidney function) tested previously. Additionally, DM199 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting tolerability observed. There were no deaths, no discontinuations due to a treatment-related adverse event (AE) and no treatment-related significant adverse events (SAEs). AEs were minor and consistent with standard treatment(s) in the CKD patient population. We announced favorable overall interim PD results from the first 28 subjects that included short-term improvements in NO, average increase of 35.2%, PGE2, average increase of 41.2%, eGFR, average increase of 4.08 mL/min/1732, and the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) excluding subjects with normal UACR levels, average decrease of 18.7%. PD results appeared to be drug related in that the greatest improvements occurred approximately 24 hours after DM199 administration and subsequently declined.

Other Clinical Studies
 
In 2017, we completed and published, in the International Journal of Clinical Trials, results from, a Phase 1b study with DM199 designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers. This study compared multiple dose levels of DM199, administered via IV and SC routes to identify a dose and delivery route that most closely compared to, or improved upon, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profile of the approved urinary KLK1 (Kailikang) in China. We found that a dose of DM199 administered via IV infusion mimicked the drug profile of IV-administered Kailikang. This study also identified a dose of DM199, administered via SC injection, which had a superior pharmacokinetic profile and that maintained more normal KLK1 levels throughout the day. Below are results from our clinical trial showing the pharmacokinetic profile of subcutaneously administered DM199 observed in study subjects as compared to what we believe is normal range in healthy subjects.
 


During 2013 and 2014, five clinical trials were completed with DM199 in over 120 volunteers, including multiple Phase 1 single dose ascending and multiple dose ascending studies in healthy volunteers and patients with Type 2 diabetes. Chronic dosing studies over 16 to 28 days were also conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with Type 2 diabetes (see below). As is generally the case for early phase clinical trials, the primary endpoints for all studies were safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. The Phase 2 (Part D) study also investigated a series of secondary endpoints that included blood glucose concentration, insulin levels, glucose tolerance testing and a variety of experimental biomarkers evaluating the potential efficacy of DM199 in treating Type 2 diabetes patients.
 
DM199 Trial Design Overview
 

Trial | Participants (N) | Design | Doses (µg/kg) | Route | Length 
-----------------+----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+----------+----------------------
Phase-1 Part A | Healthy (32) | Single ascending dose | 5, 15, 30, 50 | SC | 1 week 
Phase-1 Part B | Type 2 diabetes (10) | Single ascending dose | 0.3, 1.5, 15 | SC | 1 week 
Phase-1 Part C | Healthy (18) | Multiple ascending dose | 3, 15, 25 | SC | 6 doses over 16 days 
Phase-2A Part D | Type 2 diabetes (36) | Blinded multiple dose | Placebo, 3, 15 | SC | 10 doses over 28 days
Phase 1 Bridging | Healthy (36) | Single ascending dose | 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 1.0 3.0 | IV IV SC | 1 week 

 
In combination, these studies showed that DM199 was well tolerated and demonstrated clear physiological activity. After SC injection, DM199 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with extended half-life (i.e., the time required to reduce concentration of the drug in the body by one-half), supporting potential dosing intervals of up to one week. The dose-limiting tolerability issue in healthy volunteers was orthostatic hypotension (a condition in which blood pressure falls significantly when a person stands) observed largely at the 50 µg/kg dose level, which is much greater than the dose level anticipated to be efficacious in patients. In each trial, observed treatment emergent side-effects were mild to moderate in severity and resolved. The most common treatment-emergent side effects included headache, dizziness, nausea and injection site pain, the majority of which were observed in the highest dose group of the Phase 1-Part A trial.
 
   21

  

Two of these clinical studies focused on patients with Type 2 diabetes. The first study enrolled 10 Type 2 diabetic patients. The patients were dosed with either DM199, at three single ascending dose levels or placebo. DM199 was well-tolerated at all three dose levels by the diabetic patients with no dose limiting side effects. The second study in patients with Type 2 diabetes enrolled 36 patients treated with one of two SC dose levels of DM199 or placebo over 28 days. This study achieved its primary endpoints and demonstrated that DM199 was well-tolerated. The secondary endpoints for this study, however, were not met. The secondary efficacy endpoints were confounded due to what we believe were significant execution errors caused by protocol deviations occurring at the clinical trial site that were unable to be reconciled. See “Part I. Item 1. Business—Legal Proceedings” for more information on this study.
 
Potential DM199 Commercial Advantages
 
Several researchers have studied the structural and functional properties of KLK1. This deep body of knowledge has revealed the potential clinical benefits of KLK1 treatments. Today, forms of KLK1 derived from human urine and porcine pancreas are sold in Japan, China and Korea to treat AIS, CKD, retinopathy, hypertension and related diseases. We are not aware of any synthetic version of KLK1 with regulatory approval for human use in any country, nor any synthetic version in development besides our drug candidate DM199 (recombinant human KLK1). We believe at least five companies have attempted, unsuccessfully, to create a synthetic version of KLK1.
 
The growing understanding of the role of KLK1 in human health and its use in Asia as an approved therapeutic highlight two important potential commercial advantages for DM199:
 

● | KLK1 treatment is sold in Japan, China and Korea. Research has shown that patients with low levels of KLK1 are associated with a variety of diseases related to vascular dysfunction, such as CKD, AIS, retinopathy and hypertension. Clinical trial data with human urine and porcine derived KLK1 has demonstrated statistically significant clinical benefits in treating a variety of patients with KLK1 compared to placebo. These efficacy results are further substantiated by established markets in Japan, China and Korea for pharmaceutical sales of KLK1 derived from human urine and porcine pancreas. We estimate that millions of patients have been treated with these forms of KLK1 in Asia. Altogether, we believe this supports a strong market opportunity for a synthetic version of KLK1 such as DM199.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | KLK1 treatment has had limited side effects and has been well tolerated in studies to date. KLK1 is naturally produced by the human body; and, therefore, the body’s own control mechanisms act to limit potential side effects. The only notable side effect observed in our clinical trials was orthostatic hypotension, or a sudden drop in blood pressure, which was only seen at doses 10 to 20 times higher than our anticipated therapeutic dose levels. Moreover, routine clinical use of KLK1 treatment in Asia we understand has been well-tolerated by patients for several decades. In 2017, we completed a clinical trial comparing the pharmacokinetic profile of DM199 to the human urinary form of KLK1 (Kailikang), which showed DM199, when administered in intravenous form, had a similar pharmacokinetic profile. Further, when DM199 was administered subcutaneously, DM199 demonstrated a longer acting pharmacokinetic profile, superior to the intravenously administered Kailikang and DM199.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   22

  

In addition, we believe that there are also significant formulation, manufacturing, regulatory and other advantages for synthetic human KLK1 drug candidate DM199:
 

● | Potency and Impurity Considerations. KLK1 produced from human urine or porcine pancreas presents risks related to preventing impurities, endotoxins, and chemical byproducts due to the inherent variability of the isolation and purification process. We believe that this creates the risk of inconsistencies in potency and impurities from one production run to the next. However, we expect to produce a consistent formulation of KLK1 that is free of endotoxins and other impurities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost and Scalability. Large quantities of human urine and porcine pancreas must be obtained to derive a small amount of KLK1. This creates potential procurement, cost and logistical challenges to source the necessary raw material, particularly for human urine sourced KLK1. Once sourced, the raw material is processed using chemicals and costly capital equipment and produces a significant amount of byproduct waste. Our novel recombinant manufacturing process utilizes widely available raw materials and can be readily scaled for commercial production. Accordingly, we believe our manufacturing process will have significant cost and scalability advantages.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regulatory. We are not aware of any attempts by manufacturers of the urine or porcine based KLK1 products to pursue regulatory approvals in the United States. We believe that this is related to challenges presented by using inconsistent and potentially hazardous biomaterials, such as human urine and porcine pancreas, and their resulting ability to produce a consistent drug product. Our novel recombinant manufacturing process utilizes widely available raw materials which we believe provides a significant regulatory advantage, particularly in regions such as the United States, Europe and Canada, where safety standards are high. In addition, we believe that DM199 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

From a strategic perspective, we continue to believe that strategic alternatives with respect to our DM199 product candidate, including licenses and business collaborations, with other regional and global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be important in advancing the clinical development of DM199. Therefore, as a matter of course and from time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding these matters.
 
Regulatory Approval
 
Securing regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products in the United States, Europe, Canada and other commercial territories is a long and costly process that is controlled by that particular territory’s national regulatory agency. The national regulatory agency in the United States is the FDA, in Europe it is the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and in Canada it is Health Canada. Other national regulatory agencies have similar regulatory approval processes, but each national regulatory agency has its own approval processes. Approval in the United States, Europe or Canada does not assure approval by other national regulatory agencies, although often test results from one country may be used in applications for regulatory approval in another country.
 
Prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a drug product, every national regulatory agency has a variety of statutes and regulations which govern the principal development activities. These laws require controlled research and testing of products, governmental review, and approval of a submission containing preclinical and clinical data establishing the safety and efficacy of the product for each use sought, approval of manufacturing facilities including adherence to good manufacturing practices (GMP) during production and storage, and control of marketing activities, including advertising, labeling and pricing approval.
 
   23

  

None of our product candidates have been completely developed or tested; and, therefore, we are not yet in a position to seek regulatory approval in any territory to market any of our product candidates.
 
The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
U.S. Approval Process
 
In the United States, the FDA is responsible for the drug approval process. The FDA’s mission is to ensure that all medications on the market are safe and effective. The FDA’s approval process examines and thoroughly reviews potential new drugs; only those that are in compliance with the Code of Regulations, 21 CFR 312 and 21 CFR 314 are approved.
 
The U.S. food and drug regulations require licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and approval of test results prior to marketing of therapeutic products, and adherence to GMP, as defined by each licensing jurisdiction, during production.
 
A description of the different stages in the drug approval process in the United States follows.
 
Stage 1: Preclinical Research. After an experimental drug is discovered, research is conducted to help determine its potential for treating or curing an illness. This is called preclinical research. Animal and/or bench studies are conducted to determine if there are any harmful effects of the drug and to help understand how the drug works. Information from these experiments is submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The FDA reviews the information in the IND and decides if the drug is safe to study in humans.
Stage 2: Clinical Research. The experimental drug is studied in humans. The studies are known as clinical trials. Clinical trials are carefully designed and controlled experiments in which the experimental drug is administered to patients to test its safety and to determine the effectiveness of an experimental drug. The four general phases of clinical research are described below.

● | Phase 1 Clinical Studies. Phase 1 clinical studies are generally conducted with healthy volunteers who are not taking other medicines; patients with the illness that the drug is intended to treat are not tested at this stage. Ultimately, Phase 1 studies demonstrate how an experimental drug affects the body of a healthy individual. Phase 1 consists of a series of small studies consisting of “tens” of volunteers. Tests are done on each volunteer throughout the study to see how the person’s body processes, responds to, and is affected by the drug. Low doses and high doses of the drug are usually studied, resulting in the determination of the safe dosage range in volunteers by the end of Phase 1. This information will determine whether the drug proceeds to Phase 2.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   24

  


● | Phase 2 Clinical Studies. Phase 2 clinical studies are conducted in order to determine how an experimental drug affects people who have the disease to be treated. Phase 2 usually consists of a limited number of studies that help determine the drug’s short-term safety, side effects, and general effectiveness. The studies in Phase 2 often are controlled investigations involving comparison between the experimental drug and a placebo, or between the experimental drug and an existing drug. Information gathered in Phase 2 studies will determine whether the drug proceeds to Phase 3.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 Clinical Studies. Phase 3 clinical studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials that are used to more fully investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. These trials differ from Phase 2 trials because a larger number of patients are studied (sometimes in the thousands) and because the studies are usually double blinded, placebo controlled and of longer duration. As well, Phase 3 studies can include patients who have more than one illness and are taking medications in addition to the experimental drug used in the study. Therefore, the patients in Phase 3 studies more closely reflect the general population. The information from Phase 3 forms the basis for most of the drug’s initial labeling, which will guide physicians on how to use the drug.

● | Phase 4 Clinical Studies. Phase 4 clinical studies are conducted after a drug is approved. Phase 4 studies may be required by the FDA or conducted by companies to more fully understand how their drug compares to other drugs. FDA-required Phase 4 studies often investigate the drug in specific types of patients that may not have been included in the Phase 3 studies and can involve very large numbers of patients to further assess the drug’s safety.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Stage 3: FDA Review for Approval. Following the completion of Phase 3 clinical studies, the pharmaceutical company prepares an electronic common technical document reporting all clinical nonclinical and chemistry, manufacturing and control studies conducted on the drug that is transmitted to the FDA as a New Drug Application (NDA). The FDA reviews the information in the NDA to determine if the drug is safe and effective for its intended use. An advisory panel meeting is scheduled for a new drug allowing the FDA to gain feedback from experts. If the FDA determines that the drug is safe and effective, the drug will be approved.
 
Stage 4: Marketing. After the FDA has approved the experimental drug, the pharmaceutical company can make it available to physicians and their patients. A company also may continue to conduct research to discover new uses for the drug. Each time a new use for a drug is discovered, the drug once again is subject to the entire FDA approval process before it can be marketed for that purpose.
 
Any FDA approved pharmaceutical products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements is likely to have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.

DM199 may qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product (BLA) cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA.
 
European Approval Process
 
The EMA is roughly parallel to the FDA in terms of the drug approval process and the strict requirements for approval. The EMA was set up in 1995 in an attempt to harmonize, but not replace, the work of existing national medicine regulatory bodies in individual European countries. As with the FDA, the EMA drug review and approval process follows similar stages from preclinical testing through clinical testing in Phase 1, 2, and 3. There are some differences between the FDA and EMA review process, specifically the review process in individual European countries. Such differences may allow certain drug products to be tested in patients at an earlier stage of development.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other divisions of the U.S. government, including, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.  For example, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs, a company, including its sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act as it relates to advertising and promotion of drugs, the federal False Claims Act, as amended, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and similar state laws.  If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA), and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.  Among other things, OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products being lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.  Additionally, the ACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers.  There may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, in the future, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products.  If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements may apply.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy; and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
   26

  

The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product candidate to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 
Research and Development
 
We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development (R&D) which therefore comprises the largest component of our operating costs. Our primary focus over the past approximately nine years has been our lead product candidate, DM199, which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of AIS and CKD.
 
We expect our R&D expenses will continue to increase in the future as we advance our initial product candidate, DM199, through clinical trials in AIS and CKD and seek to expand our product candidate portfolio. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming and we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be integral to our long-term success. The actual probability of success for each product candidate, clinical indication and preclinical program may be affected by a variety of factors including, among other things, the safety and efficacy data for each product candidate, amounts invested in their respective programs, competition and competitive developments, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.
 
   27

  

R&D expenses include:
 

● | expenses incurred under contract research agreements and other agreements with third parties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expenses incurred under agreements with clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | employee and consultant-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of clinical trials and non-clinical studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the cost of acquiring, developing, manufacturing, and distributing clinical trial materials; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | facilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other supply costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities such as clinical trials are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites.
 
We expect that it will be at least three to five years, if ever, before we have any product candidates ready for commercialization.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of DM199 nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We rely on Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC (Catalent), a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) with proven GMP experience in the manufacturing of recombinant proteins for clinical trials, for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients for our clinical trials. We have licensed certain gene expression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing relationship with Catalent.
Sales and Marketing
 
We have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for our initial product candidate, DM199, or any future product candidates, because it is still early in the clinical development stage. We currently expect to partner with a large pharmaceutical company for sales execution. However, our future commercial strategy may include the use of distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force, as well as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States.
Intellectual Property
 
We view patents and other means of intellectual property protection including trade secrets as an important component of our core business. We focus on translating our innovations into intangible property protecting our proprietary technology from infringement by competitors. To that end, patents are reviewed frequently and continue to be sought in relation to those components or concepts of our preclinical and clinical products to provide protection. Our strategy, where possible, is to file patent applications to protect our product candidates, as well as methods of manufacturing, administering and using a product candidate. Prior art searches of both patent and scientific databases are performed to evaluate novelty, inventiveness and freedom-to-operate. We require all employees, consultants and parties to a collaborative research agreement to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting relationships or a collaboration with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the engagement with us is to be kept confidential. We also maintain agreements with our scientific staff and all parties contracted in a scientific capacity affirming that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, using our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period covered by the agreement are the exclusive property of DiaMedica.
 
   28

  

Our DM199 patent portfolio includes three granted U.S. patents, a granted European patent and pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea and the United States. Granted or pending claims offer various forms of protection for DM199 including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific formulations and dosing levels and methods for treating a variety of diseases, including chronic kidney disease, stroke and related disorders. These U.S. patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail below.
 
Issued patents held by us cover the DM199 composition of matter based on an optimized combination of closely-related isoforms that differ in the extent of glycosylation (process by which sugars are chemically attached to proteins). Issued claims in this patent family cover the most pharmacologically active variants of DM199 and methods of using the same for treating ischemic conditions and these patents are due to expire in 2033. A second patent family includes an issued U.S. patent with claims directed to methods of treating subjects by administering a SC formulation of DM199 or related recombinant kallikrein-1 (KLK1) polypeptides and is predicted to expire in 2033. The pending applications are directed to a range of dose levels and dosing regimens of DM199 that are potentially useful for treating a wide range of diseases including, e.g. pulmonary arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, stroke and vascular dementia which, if granted, are predicted to expire in 2038.
 
As previously discussed, we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of DM199. We are contracting with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. We have licensed certain gene expression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. Under the terms of this license, certain milestone and royalty payments may become due and are dependent upon, among other factors, performing clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and ultimately the successful commercialization of a new drug, the outcome and timing of which is uncertain. The royalty term is indefinite but the license agreement may be canceled by us on 90 days’ prior written notice. The license may not be terminated by Catalent unless we fail to make required milestone and royalty payments.
 
Methods and reagents required for commercial scale manufacture of DM199 are subject to a series of patents issued to Catalent. We license these patents from Catalent, and such license is exclusive as it relates to the production of DM199 or any human KLK1 protein.
 
We believe that our proprietary technology along with trade secrets and specialized knowledge of the manufacturing process will provide substantial protection from third-party competitors. We also believe that DM199 cannot be easily reverse engineered for the production of a copycat version.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act), and we may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from December 31, 2018. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a large accelerated filer, our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, in this report, we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and have not included certain other information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
