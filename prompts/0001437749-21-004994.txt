Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” are used in this 2020 Form 10-K to refer to Northwest Pipe Company or one of our consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole. We were incorporated in the State of Oregon in 1966.
 
Overview
 
Northwest Pipe Company is a leading manufacturer for water related infrastructure products. In addition to being the largest manufacturer of engineered steel water pipeline systems in North America, we produce high-quality precast and reinforced concrete products, Permalok® steel casing pipe, bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe, as well as linings, coatings, joints, and one of the largest offerings of fittings and specialized components. Our ten manufacturing facilities are strategically positioned to meet growing water and wastewater infrastructure needs. We provide solution-based products for a wide range of markets including water transmission and infrastructure, water and wastewater plant piping, structural stormwater and sewer systems, trenchless technology, and pipeline rehabilitation. Our prominent position is based on a widely-recognized reputation for quality, service, and manufacturing to meet performance expectations in all categories including highly-corrosive environments.
 
Our water infrastructure products are sold generally to installation contractors, who include our products in their bids to federal, state, and municipal agencies, privately-owned water companies, or developers for specific projects. We believe our sales are substantially driven by spending on urban growth and new water infrastructure with a recent trend towards spending on water infrastructure replacement, repair, and upgrade. Within the total range of products, our steel pipe tends to fit the larger-diameter, higher-pressure pipeline applications, while our precast concrete products mainly serve stormwater and sanitary sewer systems.
 
With steady population growth and regional community expansion, as well as continued drought conditions, existing water sources have become stressed, and we see continued opportunities for growth in North American infrastructure.
 
Recent Strategic Actions
 
On January 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of 100% of Geneva Pipe and Precast Company (fka Geneva Pipe Company, Inc.) for a purchase price of $49.4 million. Geneva is a concrete pipe and precast concrete products manufacturer based in Utah. This acquisition expanded our water infrastructure product capabilities by adding additional reinforced concrete pipe capacity and a full line of precast concrete products including storm drains and manholes, catch basins, vaults, and curb inlets as well as innovative lined products that extend the life of concrete pipe and manholes for sewer applications. Operations have continued with Geneva's previous management and workforce at its three manufacturing facilities.
 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Consistent with national guidelines and with state and local orders to date, we currently continue to operate our manufacturing facilities in the United States as we produce critical water infrastructure products. We have taken proactive and precautionary steps to ensure the safety of our employees, customers, and suppliers, including frequent cleaning and disinfection of workspaces, providing personal protective equipment, instituting social distancing measures, and offering remote working environments for certain employees.
 
In early April 2020, we were ordered to close our water infrastructure manufacturing facility in San Luis Río Colorado, Mexico (“SLRC”) as a result of mandates made by Mexican authorities that companies that do not carry out essential activities in Mexico must suspend business operations in order to combat and eradicate the existence and transmission of COVID-19. We diverted orders on a case-by-case basis to our United States-based facilities during this closure. In early June 2020, the Mexican authorities determined our SLRC facility was essential, and allowed weekly increases to our workforce. By July 2020, operations at our SLRC facility were fully restored.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse effect on our reported results for the year ended December 31, 2020, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities to contain the pandemic or treat its impact. Furthermore, the impacts on global and domestic economic conditions, including the long-term potential to reduce or delay funding of municipal projects, and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business.
 
Our Industry
 
Much of the United States water infrastructure is antiquated and many authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), believe the United States water infrastructure is in critical need of update, repair, or replacement. In its 2015 Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment released in March 2018, the EPA estimated the nation will need to spend $473 billion in infrastructure investments by 2034 to continue to provide safe drinking water to the public. The American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”) has given poor ratings to many aspects of the United States water infrastructure in their 2017 Infrastructure Report Card for Drinking Water. In its Failure to Act: Closing the Infrastructure Investment Gap for America’s Economic Future study published in 2016, the ASCE concludes that significant portions of many municipal water systems are 40 to 50 years old and are nearing the end of their useful lives, and estimates there will be $150 billion in capital investment needs for water and wastewater infrastructure by 2025, and $204 billion in capital investment needs by 2040. The American Water Works Association concluded in their 2012 report, Buried No Longer: Confronting America’s Water Infrastructure Challenge, that from 2011 to 2035 more than $1 trillion will be needed to repair and expand drinking water infrastructure.
 
A combination of new population centers, rising demand on developed water sources, substantial underinvestment in water infrastructure over the past several decades, and increasingly stringent regulatory policies are driving demand for water infrastructure projects in the United States. These trends are intensifying the need for new water infrastructure as well as the need to upgrade, repair, and replace existing water infrastructure. While we believe this offers the potential for increased demand for our water infrastructure products and other products related to water transmission, budgetary pressures could impact governmental and public water agency projects in the near-term.
 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of the United States will increase by approximately 56 million people between 2021 and 2050. The resulting increase in demand will require substantial new infrastructure, as the existing United States water infrastructure is not equipped to provide water to millions of new residents. The development of new sources of water at greater distances from population centers will drive the demand for new water transmission lines. The 2021 Dodge Construction Outlook forecasts U.S. public works construction starts in 2021 will remain the same as 2020 levels.
 
As water systems degrade over time and cause failures, many current water supply sources are in danger of being exhausted. Much of the drinking water infrastructure in major cities was built in the mid-20th century with a lifespan of 75 to 100 years. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card for Drinking Water, the ASCE estimates there are 240,000 water main breaks per year in the United States, wasting over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water, which equates to 14% to 18% of each day’s treated water. The ASCE also reports that with utilities averaging a pipe replacement rate of 0.5% per year, it will take an estimated 200 years to replace the system – nearly double the useful life of the pipes. These aging water and wastewater systems will drive demand for future investment.
 
Finally, the increased public awareness of problems with the quality of drinking water and efficient water usage has resulted in more stringent application of federal and state environmental regulations. The need to comply with these regulations in an environment of heightened public awareness is expected to contribute to demand in the water infrastructure industry.
 
Our large-diameter, engineered welded steel pipeline systems are utilized in water, energy, structural, and plant piping applications. Our core market is the large-diameter, high-pressure portion of a water transmission pipeline that is typically at the “upper end” of a pipeline system. This is the portion of the overall water pipeline that generally transports water from the source to a treatment plant or from a treatment plant into the distribution system, rather than the small lines that deliver water directly into households. We believe the total addressable market for the engineered welded steel pipeline system products sold will be approximately $1.4 billion over the next three years.

Our high-quality precast and reinforced concrete products and bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe are typically used in non-pressure, gravity fed sewer and stormwater applications. Demand for these products is generally influenced by general economic conditions such as housing starts, population growth, and interest rates. In 2020, annual housing starts in the United States increased to 1.4 million, an increase of 7.0% from 2019, according to the United States Census Bureau.
 
Federal initiatives to improve the conditions of the aging water infrastructure include the Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center at the EPA and the Water and Environmental Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Water Resources Development Act, which was included in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act signed by the President of the United States in December 2016, authorizes new infrastructure projects around the country and contains substantive provisions in regards to drinking water infrastructure. According to its 2020 Annual Report, the EPA’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, which provides credit assistance for water infrastructure projects, closed 27 loans totaling over $4 billion in 2020. Additionally, the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, a federal-state partnership and financial assistance program to help water systems and states achieve the health protection objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act, awarded $6.1 billion in grants for Intended Use Plans during the 2019-2020 fiscal year, according to Bluefield Research’s July 2020 Data Insight State Revolving Funds: Breaking Down Project Data by Requests and Distributions.
 
In addition to the Federal initiatives, individual states are also taking action. In November 2014, the State of California approved the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act which authorizes $7.5 billion in general obligation bonds to fund state water supply infrastructure projects, such as public water system improvements, surface and groundwater storage, drinking water protection, water recycling and advanced water treatment technology, water supply management and conveyance, wastewater treatment, drought relief, emergency water supplies, and ecosystem and watershed protection and restoration. The State of Texas has earmarked $27 billion of future bond funding for state water projects over the next 50 years through their State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT). This program provides low-interest and deferred loans to state agencies making approved investments in water infrastructure projects. Our strategically located manufacturing facilities are well-positioned to take advantage of the anticipated growth in demand.
 
Backlog
 
We measure backlog as a key metric to evaluate the commercial health of our business. Backlog represents the balance of remaining performance obligations under signed contracts for water infrastructure steel pipe products for which revenue is recognized over time. Binding agreements received by us may be subject to cancelation or postponement; however, cancelation would obligate the customer to pay the contract consideration proportional to the costs we have incurred through the cancelation date. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, backlog was approximately $167 million and $199 million, respectively. Backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual operating results for any fiscal period. There can be no assurance that any amount of backlog ultimately will be realized. Separate from our backlog, we have been notified that we are the successful bidder on additional projects, but binding agreements have not been executed (“confirmed orders”). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, backlog including confirmed orders was approximately $221 million and $258 million, respectively. Projects for which a binding agreement has not been executed could be canceled.
Products
 
Water infrastructure steel pipe is used for high-pressure applications, typically requiring pipe to withstand pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Most of our water transmission products, mainly welded steel pipe and bar-wrapped cylinder pipe, are made to project specifications for fully engineered, large-diameter, high-pressure water infrastructure systems. Other uses include power generation circulating water systems, penstocks, pipe piling, and water and wastewater treatment plants. Spiral welded pipe is manufactured in diameters ranging from 24 inches to 156 inches with wall thickness of 0.135 inch to 1.00 inch. Our rolled and welded capabilities allow for manufacturing diameters greater than 156 inches or wall thicknesses exceeding 1.00 inch. Linings and coating capabilities include cement mortar, polyurethane, epoxies, polyethylene tape, and coal-tar enamel according to our customers’ project specifications. Fabrication of fittings and specials are performed at our own facilities providing installation contractors and project owners with a complete engineered system. Product is delivered to the jobsite using commercial trucks or marine transport as needed.
 
We manufacture Permalok® steel casing pipe, which is a proprietary pipe joining system that employs a press-fit interlocking connection system. The Permalok® product is generally installed in trenchless construction projects.

Additionally we manufacture high-quality precast and reinforced concrete products, bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe, as well as linings, coatings, joints, and one of the largest offerings of fittings and specialized components typically used in non-pressure, gravity fed sewer and stormwater applications. Our precast products include manholes, box culverts, vaults, catch basins, and other precast infrastructure products. Our reinforced concrete pipe is manufactured in sizes ranging from twelve inches to 96 inches in diameter and in a variety of strength classes.
 
Manufacturing
 
Water infrastructure steel pipe manufacturing begins with the preparation of engineered drawings of each unique piece of pipe in a project. These drawings are prepared on our proprietary computer-aided design system and are used as blueprints to manufacture pipe. After the drawings are completed and approved, the manufacturing of engineered steel water pipe begins by feeding a steel coil continuously at a specified angle into a spiral weld mill which cold-forms the band into a tubular configuration with a spiral seam. Automated arc welders, positioned on both the inside and the outside of the tube, are used to weld the seam. The welded pipe is then cut at the specified length. After completion of the forming and welding phases, the finished cylinder is tested and inspected in accordance with project specifications, which may include 100% radiographic analysis of the weld seam. The cylinders are then coated and lined as specified. Possible coatings include polyurethane paint, polyethylene tape, epoxies, cement mortar, coal-tar enamel, and Pritec®. The inside of the pipe cylinders can be lined with cement mortar, polyurethane, or epoxies. Following coating and lining, certain pieces may be custom fabricated as required for the project. This process is performed at our on-site fabrication facilities. Completed pipes are evaluated for structural integrity with a hydrotester prior to shipment.
 
We manufacture a wide variety of precast concrete products, including lined manhole systems, box culverts, utility vaults, manholes, catch basins and inlets, and other custom precast structures. Precast concrete products are manufactured using either a dry cast or wet cast concrete mix, depending on the size of the piece and the number of identical pieces to be manufactured. In the dry cast method, a concrete mix with low water content, known as zero-slump concrete, is poured into a mold and then densely compacted around the steel reinforcement using a variety of manufacturing methods. The concrete structure is immediately removed from the mold and allowed to cure in a high humidity environment to ensure proper hydration of the concrete. This method allows multiple pieces to be produced from the same mold each day and is most suitable for high volume, repetitive manufacturing. In the wet cast method, a concrete mix with relatively high water content is poured into a mold and allowed to cure in the mold, which can take from four to 16 hours. We also manufacture reinforced concrete pipe by producing a steel mesh cage, enclosing it in a form or mold, and then pouring concrete around it to produce the pipe.
 
Technology. Advances in technology help us produce high-quality products at competitive prices. We have invested in modern welding and inspection equipment to improve both productivity and product quality. We own interlocking pipe joining system technologies (Permalok®) that provide an alternate joint solution used for connecting steel pipes. In addition, we are licensed to manufacture a conventional reinforced concrete pipe with a high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) composite liner to protect concrete pipe from corrosion, and a lined manhole system, which integrates a precast concrete monolithic base with a plastic liner that is chemically resistant to raw sewage.
 
To stay current with technological developments in the United States and abroad, we participate in trade shows, industry associations, research projects, and vendor trials of new products. Our staff includes some of the most tenured and experienced pipe manufacturing professionals in the nation.
 
Quality Assurance. We have quality management systems in place that assure we are consistently providing products that meet or exceed customer and applicable regulatory requirements. All of our steel pipe manufacturing facilities’ quality management systems in the United States and Mexico are registered under a multi-site registration by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”). In addition to the ISO qualification, we are certified for specific steel pipe products or operations by the American Petroleum Institute. All of our steel pipe water transmission manufacturing facilities are certified by NSF International for cement lining. We are certified for specific precast and reinforced concrete products or operations by the National Precast Concrete Association and the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association. We also follow and make products to the following standards and specifications: American Institute of Steel Construction, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Welding Society, Caltrans, American Water Works Association, ASTM International, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, and the ASCE. All of our steel pipe nondestructive evaluation technicians are qualified and certified to the guidelines of the American Society for Nondestructive Testing.

Our quality assurance/quality control department is responsible for monitoring and measuring the characteristics of our products. Inspection capabilities include, but are not limited to, visual, dimensional, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, hydrostatic, ultrasonic, conventional, computed and real-time x-ray/radioscopic, base material tensile, yield and elongation, sand sieve analysis, coal-tar penetration, concrete compression, lining and coating dry film thickness, adhesion, concrete absorption, guided bend, charpy impact, hardness, metallurgical examinations, chemical analysis, spectrographic analysis, and finished product final inspection. Our products are not released for customer shipment until there is verification that all requirements have been met.
 
Product Liability. The manufacturing and use of our products involve a variety of risks. Certain losses may result, or be alleged to result, from defects in our products, thereby subjecting us to claims for damages including consequential damages. We warrant our products to be free of certain defects for one year. We maintain insurance coverage against potential product liability claims in the amount of $51 million, which we believe to be adequate. Historically, product liability claims against us have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that product liability claims exceeding our insurance coverage will not be experienced in the future or that we will be able to maintain such insurance with adequate coverage.
Product Development
 
Our product development efforts focus on innovative solutions for water infrastructure. We continually strive to improve existing products as well as develop new products to satisfy consumer needs, expand revenue opportunities, maintain or extend competitive advantages, increase market share, and reduce production costs.
 
In October 2020, we introduced our new Perfect Pipe and Perfect Lined Manhole Systems, which are constructed of reinforced concrete pipe lined with either a HDPE or plastic lining system that improves hydraulics. The smooth internal surface provides optimal flow compared to conventional concrete. Additionally, the super-strong integrated structure eliminates pipe deflection potential and minimizes the risk of long-term flow restriction. Together, these innovative products offer a lined system that can connect to any municipal wastewater system and elongates the system's life.
 
Also in 2020, we obtained a patent for our Permalok® PR joint, created specifically for pipe ramming. We teamed with pipe ramming contractors and equipment manufacturers to address the concerns of energy transfer loss during ramming a mechanical joint, which typically resulted in a jacking limitation of less than 200 linear feet depending on soil conditions. The Permalok® PR joint utilizes a proprietary negative interference fit connection to capitalize on the mechanical properties of the material to reduce energy transfer loss during ramming operations. The result is longer drives without welding, enabling teams to complete pipe ram projects faster than ever.
 
Marketing
 
Our steel pipe manufacturing facility locations in Oregon, California, Texas, West Virginia, Missouri, and Mexico allow us to efficiently serve customers throughout North America. The primary customers for our water infrastructure steel pipe products are installation contractors for projects funded by public water agencies. Our marketing strategy emphasizes early identification of potential water projects, promotion of specifications consistent with our capabilities and products, and close contact with the project designers and owners throughout the design phase. Our in-house sales force is comprised of sales representatives, engineers, and support personnel who work closely with public water agencies, contractors, and engineering firms, often years in advance of projects being bid. These relationships allow us to identify and evaluate planned projects at early stages, and pursue these projects by offering technical support and resources. After an agency completes a design, they publicize the upcoming bid for a water transmission project. We then obtain detailed plans and develop our estimate for the pipe portion of the project. We typically bid to installation contractors who include our bid in their proposals to public water agencies. A public water agency generally awards the entire project to the contractor with the lowest responsive bid.
 
Our three precast and reinforced concrete product manufacturing facilities in Utah allow us to efficiently serve customers throughout the Intermountain West region. The primary customers for our water infrastructure precast and reinforced concrete products are installation contractors for various government, residential, and non-residential projects. Our marketing strategy emphasizes our product quality and variety of offerings, competitive pricing, customer service, and technical expertise. Our in-house sales force is comprised of sales representatives, engineers, and support personnel who work closely with the customers to find the right product or solution for their specific need.

Competition
 
Most water infrastructure projects are competitively bid and price competition is vigorous. Price competition may reduce the gross margin on sales, which may adversely affect overall profitability. Other competitive factors include timely delivery, ability to meet customized specifications, and high freight costs which may limit the ability of manufacturers located in other market areas to compete with us. With water infrastructure steel pipe manufacturing facilities in Oregon, California, Texas, West Virginia, Missouri, and Mexico, we believe we can more effectively compete throughout North America. Our primary competitors in the western United States and southwestern Canada are Imperial Pipe and West Coast Pipe. East of the Rocky Mountains, our primary competitors are Thompson Pipe Group, American SpiralWeld Pipe, and Mid America Pipe Fabricating & Supply, LLC. Our three precast and reinforced concrete product manufacturing facilities in Utah have several competitors which are primarily other precast concrete manufacturers in the Intermountain West region of the United States.
 
No assurance can be given that new or existing competitors will not build new facilities or expand capacity within our market areas. In 2019, a competitor broke ground on a new spiral welded steel pipe plant in Texas that is expected to be operational in 2021. New or expanded facilities or new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to capture market share and maintain product pricing.
 
Raw Materials and Supplies
 
The main raw component in our steel pipe manufacturing process is steel. We have historically purchased hot rolled and galvanized steel coil from both domestic and foreign steel mills. Our suppliers include ArcelorMittal USA LLC, Big River Steel, Nucor Corporation, Steel Dynamics, Inc., Altos Hornos de México S.A.B de C.V., and SSAB. Steel is normally purchased after project award. Purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature and steel prices fluctuate significantly, influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, availability of raw materials, energy costs, import duties, other trade restrictions, and currency exchange rates. The main raw components in our precast and reinforced concrete products are cement and aggregate, which are widely available commodities. When possible, we source these raw materials from suppliers near our facilities. We also rely on certain suppliers of coating materials, lining materials, and certain custom fabricated items.
 
We have at least two suppliers for most of our raw materials. We believe our relationships with our suppliers are positive and have no indication that we will experience shortages of raw materials or components essential to our production processes or that we will be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. Any shortages of raw materials may result in production delays and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operations can be affected by seasonal variations and our results tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of each year due to typically milder weather in the regions in which we operate. We are more likely to be impacted by weather extremes, such as excessive rain, hurricanes, snow and ice, or frigid temperatures, which may cause temporary, short-term anomalies in our operational performance in certain localized geographic regions. However, these impacts usually have not been material to our operations as a whole. See Part I — Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion.
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to various environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations. We believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not currently believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that, in the future, we will not incur additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material.
 
    7 

  

In particular, we are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations, violations of which could lead to fines, penalties, other civil sanctions, or criminal sanctions. These environmental laws and regulations govern emissions to air; discharges to water; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste materials. We operate under numerous governmental permits and licenses relating to air emissions, stormwater runoff, and other environmental matters. We are subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties we presently own or operate and at third-party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arrange to send hazardous waste. For example, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II — Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2020 Form 10-K. Estimating liabilities for environmental investigations and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control which may change dramatically. We have no reserves for environmental investigation or cleanup, and we believe this is appropriate based on current information; however, we cannot provide assurance that our future environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not result in a material expense.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
Employees. As of December 31, 2020, we had 956 employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time. Approximately 71% of our workforce is employed on an hourly basis, while 29% is salaried. Approximately 7% of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with a single labor union. We consider our relations with our employees and the labor union to be good.
 
We offer a wide array of company-paid benefits to our employees both in the United States and Mexico. Benefits may vary between countries due to customary local practices and statutory requirements; however, we believe that they are competitive relative to others in our industry.
 
Culture. Our key values are captured in the acronym ACT, which stands for Accountability, Commitment, and Teamwork, which we seek to demonstrate in our daily actions.
 
Health and Safety. Our goal is to send each employee home safe at the end of the day. As such, safety is at the central core of our culture, and is infused at every level of our organization. More than just policy and procedure, our safety program gives equal focus to the human side of safety, integrating coaching and mentoring efforts with compliance-driven approaches. By instilling a deep commitment to safety that reaches from our CEO to an apprentice on the floor, we have achieved industry-leading safety performance. Over the last four years, our average total recordable incident rate was 2.43% and our average days away rate was 0.60%, calculated in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s record keeping requirements.
 
As a manufacturer, we work hard to eliminate hazards associated with high-risk work and have measures in place that include programs for fall protection, heavy equipment operation, and lockout/tagout. We also focus on personal safety issues, such as complacency and fatigue. We seek to keep our employees healthy during the COVID‑19 pandemic by taking proactive and precautionary steps to ensure the safety of our employees including frequent cleaning and disinfection of workspaces, providing personal protective equipment, instituting social distancing measures, and offering remote working environments for certain employees.
 
Each of our plants utilize various interactions to achieve this performance, from a toolbox meeting to cover the day’s work and any particular safety concern, to monthly Safety Plan Meetings, ‘No Days Away’ Safety Awards, and our employee-favorite, Safety Day. Each year, a plant may close for one full day to cover safety training and updates. Outside vendors demonstrate the latest safety procedures and equipment in a hands-on fun atmosphere.
 
Diversity and Inclusion. Diversity and inclusion are integral to our employee experience, and we are proud of our diverse workforce. Companies that are diverse in age, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity, and perspective are shown to be more resilient. We believe that diversity and inclusion are important in building the most effective, high performing teams as part of our ACT culture. As of December 31, 2020, 47% of our employees self-identified as belonging to one or more of the following racial/ethnic groups: American Indian or Alaskan Native, African American/Black, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. As of December 31, 2020, 10% of our employees self-identified as female.
 
Our goal is to build a skilled and strong workforce that is not only diverse in race and ethnicity, but also diverse in age, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, and perspective. Our Affirmative Action Program strives to hire, recruit, train, and promote employees in job classifications without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability, or veteran’s status. To support these efforts, the Affirmative Action Plans for our facilities in the United States are reviewed annually by a third party consultant, establishing annual hiring goals for women, minorities, veterans, and individuals with disabilities.
 
    8 

  

Ethics and Compliance. We take pride in the high standards of conduct that identifies us as a company. We have controls in place relating to compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code”), including a requirement for employees to review and understand the requirements of our Code, as well as an established whistleblower hotline and related procedures.
 
We conduct training on our Code upon hire, and in regular intervals during the employee’s life cycle with us. The most recent ethics training for all salaried employees was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2019.
