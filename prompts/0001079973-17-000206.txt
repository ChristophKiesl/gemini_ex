ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the "Annual Report") we refer to Bioptix, Inc., a Colorado corporation, as "Bioptix," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our."
 
Overview
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, BiOptix Diagnostics, Inc. ("BDI"), which we acquired in September 2016, we have developed a proprietary Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance technology platform for the detection of molecular interactions.  We acquired a Surface Plasma Resonance (SPR) platform which seeks to combine high sensitivity with microarray detection capability to allow researchers to understand whether their target molecules have functionality against the disease targeted. SPR is an advanced and highly sensitive optical technology that can measure refractive index changes on a sensor chip's gold surface due to a change in mass that occurs during a binding event. This change can be used to monitor biological interactions such as the concentration of target molecules, kinetic rates and affinity constants.
 
BDI is a life science tools company that provides an affordable solution for drug discovery scientists who require label-free, real-time detection of bio-molecular interactions.  BDI manufactures, sells and services instruments and consumables to pharmaceutical researchers allowing them to develop new drugs faster than by using older technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or "ELISA". BDI was originally established with technology developed in conjunction with Dr. John L. "Jan" Hall, Adjoint Professor, JILA (University of Colorado), who shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2005 for his work on laser-based precision spectroscopy and the optical frequency comb technique. Surface Plasma Resonance (SPR) is the core of the BDI products and intellectual property.  Dr. Hall, in conjunction with the scientists at BDI, created a common path interferometer that was commercialized to become the 404pi instrument.
 
Interferometry is one of the most sensitive optical detection techniques in existence, but its power has historically not been available in a commercial instrument.  Classic interferometry requires separate optical paths for analyzing samples and providing a reference.  The two paths can be affected differently by vibration, heat, and other noise sources. Common path interferometry solves that problem by embedding two phase states into a single beam of light.  When molecular binding occurs, one of the phase states changes while the other remains constant.  The two states are subtracted and accurately provide information about affinity constants, kinetic rates, and concentration of relevant molecules.
 
BDI's technology is an ultra-sensitive detection platform that is part of the class of Surface Plasmon Resonance instruments and combines high sensitivity with microarray detection capability allowing researchers at pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research organizations to understand much earlier in the discovery process whether their target molecules have functionality against the disease targeted. BDI sells to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations and academic research institutions to help make these drug development process more effective and productive. BDI offers an affordable solution for drug discovery scientists that require label-free real-time detection of bio molecular interactions. The BDI unique enhanced SPR instrumentation offers measurement of kinetics, affinity constants and concentration, proprietary easy-to-use analytical software, and two operating modes for higher throughput and experimental flexibility.
 
When it was acquired by the Company in September 2016, BDI was in the initial stages of rolling out its first commercial product, the 404pi system.  BDI's initial revenue was generated in 2014 with first sales to customers including sales to leading academic researchers and biotech companies. BDI did not experience any significant seasonality to its business and provided normal terms to its customers, generally 30-60 days, net. Currently there is no back-log of orders.
 
Following the September 2016 acquisition of BDI, the Company began hiring sales, marketing and operational employees, adding a total of eight employees to the twelve hired in connection with the acquisition.

The BDI products include a reader instrument (404pi) and the consumable test products consisting of test chips (cassettes) and packaging.  The instrument is assembled in-house using primarily off the shelf parts and certain customized components.  Consumable test product components are manufactured at the BDI facility using certain sub-assemblies processed by third-party contractors. Raw materials and certain sub-components are acquired from a number of suppliers.
 
Recent Developments
 
Effective January 14, 2017, we adopted a plan to exit this acquired business and commenced a significant reduction in the workforce. The decision to adopt this plan was made following an evaluation by the Company's Board of Directors in January 2017, of the estimated results of operations projected during the near to mid-term period for BDI, including consideration of product development required and updated sales forecasts, and estimated additional cash resources required.  We are reviewing possible strategic alternatives relative to the business to maximize shareholder value. The Company's continuing evaluation following adoption of the plan, estimates that it will incur charges to operations in early 2017 of approximately, $2.7 million, consisting of 1) write-down of tangible and intangible assets estimated at approximately $2.2 million, and 2) wind-down, severance and transaction expenses estimated at approximately $500,000.
 
Following the recent decision to exit the BDI business, the Company has begun evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The Company expects, in the near term, to establish the primary criteria it will consider as it evaluates its next steps and strategic path forward with the goal of maximizing value for its shareholders. Additionally it will focus on attempting to locate an acquirer or partner for the BDI operations as well as continuing to attempt to locate an interested party for the appendicitis assets.
 
In March 2017, the Company completed private placements totaling $7,000,000. Included was a common stock unit financing for $2,250,000 with certain accredited investors, $1,000,000 of which has been released to the Company, with the balance in escrow pending completion of release conditions.  The Company also closed on a convertible note financing with certain accredited investors with gross proceeds totaling $4,750,000. The convertible note financing proceeds are in escrow pending successful completion of release conditions. The common stock offering sold Units at a purchase price of $2.50 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company's Common Stock and a three-year Warrant to purchase one share of the Company's common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.50. The separate securities purchase agreements for a convertible note financing totaled $4,750,000 which is being held in escrow pending completion of defined release conditions.  Following release from escrow the notes shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $2.50 per share and Warrants to purchase 1,900,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.56, shall be exercisable on or after the six-month anniversary of closing. Pursuant to the terms of the convertible note purchase agreements, the Company has agreed to file a proxy to hold a special meeting of its shareholders to among other provisions, approve the terms of the offering and authorize preferred stock, all as specified in the agreements.
 
Historical Operations
 
We also hold an exclusive license agreement with Washington University ("WU") in St. Louis which granted us an exclusive license and right to sublicense its technology for veterinary products worldwide, subject to certain exceptions.  In July 2012, we granted Ceva Sante Animale S.A. ("Ceva") an exclusive royalty-bearing license to our intellectual property and other assets, relating to recombinant single chain reproductive hormone technology for use in non-human mammals.  This license includes a sublicense of the technology licensed to us by WU.  Ceva continues to advance development of the bovine rFSH product and cumulative cash payments received to date by us from Ceva have been approximately $2 million.
 
Prior to 2016, Bioptix was an in vitro diagnostic company focused on obtaining clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for and commercializing its blood-based test to serve as an adjunctive test in the diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in children, adolescent, and young adults.  Our test, the APPY1 Test, was a CE marked rapid blood test panel for aiding in identifying patients in the emergency department who are at low risk for acute appendicitis.  We were not aware of any blood test that is cleared by the FDA to aid in ruling out appendicitis and are not aware of any competitors in this area.  The APPY1 Test was not cleared by the FDA despite our performance of clinical trials, including our pivotal clinical trial for the APPY1 Test, which was completed in early 2014.  The data demonstrated high sensitivity and high negative predictive value ("NPV"), similar to other adjunctive tests for other conditions currently in use by physicians.  In March 2014, we submitted a de novo request to the FDA for the APPY1 System.  In June 2014, the FDA sent us an Additional Information ("AI") request, which is typical of this type of submission.  We were in communication with the FDA several times while gathering the responsive information.

In December 2014, we filed a response as a submission amendment.  On January 27, 2015, the FDA notified us that it had determined that the APPY1 Test did not meet the criteria for market clearance as a class II device based upon data and information in our de novo submission and subsequent amendment.  We engaged in a number of conversations with the FDA between January and October of 2015, and determined that it was not prudent to use our financial resources to continue to advance development of the APPY1 Test to attempt to secure FDA clearance. Therefore during early 2016, we suspended operations associated with the APPY1 Test, including termination of marketing the product in the EU.  We then advanced in our pursuit of strategic alternatives for the Company and began attempting to monetize our appendicitis-related assets or partner with another company to further develop such assets.
 
In October 2015 as part of its evaluation of strategic alternatives, Bioptix entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Strand Life Sciences Private Limited ("Strand").  Bioptix entered into a series of definitive agreements with Strand, its U.S. subsidiary, Strand Genomics, Inc. ("SGI") and the shareholders of Strand on January 26, 2016. Bioptix entered into a Master Agreement with Strand and SGI, and into a series of share sale and investment agreements with the holders of more than 90% of the Strand shares, and a subsidiary of Bioptix entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with SGI.  On March 11, 2016, Bioptix, Strand and SGI entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement to terminate these definitive agreements.  Pursuant to the Mutual Termination Agreement, each of the parties was relieved of any obligations or responsibilities under the Master Agreement and other transaction agreements.  Each of the parties remained responsible for its respective transaction-related costs.
 
On February 25, 2016, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters, land and building, to a third party at a purchase price of $4,053,000.  The sale generated approximately $1.8 million in net cash after expenses and mortgage payoffs. In addition to agreeing to the sale, we rented back space in the building under short-term lease agreements that provide storage space required for our current level of operations.
 
Animal Healthcare
 
Effective May 1, 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement ("WU License Agreement") with Washington University in St. Louis (WU), which granted us an exclusive license and right to sublicense WU's technology (as defined under the WU License Agreement) for veterinary products worldwide, except where such products are prohibited under U.S. laws for export.  The term of the WU License Agreement continues until the expiration of the last of WU's patents (as defined in the WU License Agreement).  We have agreed to pay minimum annual royalties of $20,000 during the term of the WU License Agreement and such amounts are creditable against future royalties and other payments.  Royalties payable to WU under the WU License Agreement for covered product sales by us, directly or indirectly, carry a mid-single-digit royalty rate and for sublicense fees received by us carry a low double-digit royalty rate.  The WU License Agreement contains customary terms for confidentiality, prosecution and infringement provisions for licensed patents, publication rights, indemnification and insurance coverage.  The WU License Agreement is cancelable by us with ninety days advance notice at any time and by WU with sixty days advance notice if we materially breach the WU License Agreement and fail to cure such breach in a designated period.
 
In July 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (License Agreement) with Ceva Santé Animale S.A. (Licensee), under which we granted the Licensee an exclusive royalty-bearing license to our intellectual property and other assets, including patent rights and know-how, relating to recombinant single chain reproductive hormone technology for use in non-human mammals (Animal Health Assets).  The License Agreement includes a sublicense of the technology licensed to us by WU and a license to the assets acquired from Novartis under the Termination Agreement described below.  Under the terms of the WU License Agreement, a portion of the license fees and royalties we receive from sublicensing agreements will be paid to WU.  Under the License Agreement, the Licensee obtained a worldwide exclusive license to develop, seek regulatory approval for and offer to sell, market, distribute, import and export luteinizing hormone (LH) and/or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) products for bovine (cattle), equine and swine in the field of the assistance and facilitation of reproduction in bovine, equine and swine animals.  We also granted the Licensee an option and right of first refusal to develop additional animal health products outside of the licensed field of use or any diagnostic pregnancy detection tests for non-human mammals.

Intellectual Property
 
APPY1 Intellectual Property
 
Beginning in 2004, we initiated the establishment of an intellectual property portfolio for the acute appendicitis testing technology and products that have been used in the development of the APPY1 Test.  We filed for extensive patent coverage related to several aspects of the initial discovery and various test applications.  In March 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued our patent directed to methods relating to our appendicitis diagnostic technology.  This patent, No. 7,501,256 (expires February 7, 2026), is entitled "Methods and Devices for Diagnosis of Appendicitis."  Additional U.S. patents, No. 7,659,087 and No. 7,670,769, were issued on February 9, 2010 and March 2, 2010, respectively (both expiring July 25, 2025).  At this time, patents have been issued in the following foreign countries: Australia, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa.  A patent was also granted by the European Patent Office and subsequently validated in the following European countries: Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.  In late 2014, we were notified that the Canadian patent applications have been allowed and on March 24, 2015, Canadian patent 2,574,991 was granted.
 
In late 2012, additional U.S. utility and patent cooperation treaty (PCT) patent applications were filed for the appendicitis testing technology and products.  The patent filings focused on the newly developed multiple-marker technology, providing patent coverage for using the MRP 8/14 levels in a given sample in conjunction with CRP levels and WBC count among a number of other evaluated marker combinations in order to provide an increasingly robust test to aid in the management of low risk patients suspicious for appendicitis.  Additionally, the patent filings claim a method for ruling out appendicitis based on multiple markers, a device or system for assessing a subject based on a plurality of markers, and a kit or device to determine the value of a biomarker in a given sample.  Currently, further pursuit of these filings have been terminated.
 
As a result of the decision to not further pursue development of the appendicitis assets, the appendicitis patents were deemed 100% impaired as of December 31, 2016 and further pursuit of these patents has been suspended.
 
Animal Health
 
Our animal health patent portfolio originated under the exclusive license agreement with WU, under which we obtained intellectual property rights to WU's patent estate.  This extensive portfolio consists of both patents and pending patent applications (approximately 25 patents and numerous patent applications) related to our animal health products under development.  The term of the WU License Agreement ends upon the expiration of the last patent to expire.  Patents in the estate have expiration dates ranging from 2010 to 2019.  WU has filed, and continues to file, patent applications to expand and extend the patent coverage of the WU technology.  We reimburse WU for the costs of such patent filings, namely prosecution and maintenance fees.  Additional patents in the animal health portfolio have been filed by us outside of the WU License Agreement.
 
A patent filing for the recombinant luteinizing hormone technology was submitted in 2004, entitled "Methods and Kits for Maintaining Pregnancy, Treating Follicular Cysts, and Synchronizing Ovulation Using Luteinizing Hormone."  This patent family claims methods of administering rLH, the timing of administration, and dosage given in order to increase formation of accessory corpora lutea and maintain pregnancies in treated animals.  To date, five foreign patents have been granted for "Methods and Kits for Maintaining Pregnancy, Treating Follicular Cysts, and Synchronizing Ovulation Using Luteinizing Hormone," New Zealand patent 542549 was granted March 12, 2009 (expiring March 2024), Australia 2004218365 was granted May 27, 2010 (expiring March 2024), European patent 1610803 was granted December 15, 2010 (expiring March 2024), Canadian patent 2518268 was granted December 10, 2013 (expiring March 2024) and Brazil was granted May 31, 2016 (expiring March 4, 2026).

General Operations
 
Revenues — During the year ended December 31, 2016 our revenues were not significant and resulted from consumable sales made to several BDI customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, three European-based customers of the APPY1 Test accounted for total net sales, each representing 52%, 26% and 22%, respectively.  At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Bioptix accounts receivable were not significant. 
 
Research and Development — We expended approximately $863,000 and $2,159,000 on total research and development in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Virtually all of this research and development activity was incurred related to development on appendicitis products.  The Licensee conducts all research and development activities with respect to the animal health assets.
Regulatory Matters
 
FDA
 
The Company is generally not subject to regulation under the FDA or similar regulatory bodies in other markets.  The FDA had regulatory marketing authority in the United States over our APPY1 System under 21 CFR Part 820 regulations (U.S.) and ISO13485 standards (EU) for cGMP manufacturing of medical devices.

European Regulations
 
In January 2013, we obtained CE marking for the APPY1 System. In the European Union, in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices are regulated under EU-Directive 98/79/EC (IVD Directive), and related provisions.  The IVD Directive requirements include provisions for the design, manufacture, distribution and post-market surveillance of IVDs to assure the safety and efficacy of the devices. These standards include ISO 14971, risk management and ISO 13485, the quality standard for medical device manufacturers. IVD medical devices must bear the CE marking of conformity when they are placed on the market.  The CE mark is a declaration by the manufacturer that the product meets all the appropriate provisions and essential requirements outlined in the European IVD Directive.  As a general rule, the manufacturer must follow the procedure of the EC Declaration of conformity to obtain this CE marking.  Each European country must adopt its own laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the IVD Directive.
Environmental Protection
 
We are subject to various environmental laws pertaining to the disposal of hazardous medical waste.  We contract for disposal of our hazardous waste with a licensed disposal facility.  We do not expect to incur liabilities related to compliance with environmental laws; however, we cannot make a definitive prediction.  The costs we incur in disposal of hazardous waste have not been significant.

Competition
 
BDI is a small participant in a large market with a number of competitors, many of which are substantially larger than BDI.  Although the market for SPR products, such as the BDI products is large, there are a number of large market competitors, including GE Healthcare (Biacore), Ametek (Reichert SPR System) and Danaher (ForteBio/Pall Corporation).  It will be difficult for us to establish a market position in such competitive market.  We believe that most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and product development resources than we do.  In addition there are a number of other competitors in the SPR market including SensiQ Technologies, Wasatch Microfluidics and Sierra Sensors GmbH.
Properties
 
Our subsidiary, BDI leases its office and laboratory space under an agreement that expires March 31, 2018.  The facility comprises approximately 14,000 net rentable square feet and requires monthly base rent of $15,711 and common area maintenance costs are currently $10,145 per month. The Company also rents certain office and storage space under short-term arrangements.   The Company believes that its leased facilities are adequate for its near-term needs.
Other Laws
 
We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws, pertaining to matters such as safe working conditions and fire hazard control.
