Our Purpose and Values
 
Our purpose: We build meaningful connections to help businesses run smarter.  We live by our core values of hunger, heart and harmony, which set the tone for our business and define who we are.  
 
Our core values are:
 
Hunger – Our insatiable desire to create new opportunities for our clients and our business is apparent in everything we do.
 
Heart – We seek to have a positive impact in the lives of the people we serve by putting our clients, partners and teammates first.
 
Harmony – We invite perspective, and we consistently celebrate each other’s unique contributions as we work together to bring the best solutions to our clients.
 We believe that these values strengthen the overall Insight experience for our clients, partners, and teammates (we refer to our customers as “clients,” our suppliers as “partners” and our employees as “teammates”).    
Our Market
 The worldwide total addressable market for information technology is forecasted to be $3.8 trillion according to Gartner, a leading IT research and advisory company.  Based on our analysis of Gartner market data, we believe the top 10 most comparable global solution providers represent less than 20% of the worldwide total addressable market.  We believe our addressable worldwide market represents approximately $700 billion in annual sales and for the year ended December 31, 2020, our net sales of $8.3 billion represented approximately 1% of that highly diverse market.  We believe that we are well positioned in this highly fragmented global market with locations in 19 countries and our deep experience delivering IT solutions across the globe.  
Our Value Proposition
 At Insight, we build meaningful connections to help businesses run smarter. 
 As a Fortune 500-ranked global technology provider, we empower organizations of all sizes with secure Insight Intelligent Technology Solutions™ and services to help our clients maximize the value of their technology today — and prepare for tomorrow.
 Delivering client value, which helps us earn client loyalty, is our primary goal. We expect our clients to achieve long-standing advantages by leveraging our unique capabilities to provide end-to-end secure digital transformation solutions and services. From IT strategy and design to implementation and management, we meet clients wherever they are now, and work alongside them to get them where they want to be.
 Insight has a differentiated investment and solution development strategy. Through organic investment and strategic acquisitions, we’ve developed scale and innovative solutions in three primary areas: Digital Innovation, Cloud and Data Center Transformation, and Connected Workforce. Underpinning these core solution areas is our pervasive security capability and our legacy, global, at-scale supply chain optimization systems and tools.

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 

E-commerce and Cloud Management Systems – In recent years, cloud and as-a-service solutions have become more mainstream and adoption continues to increase across markets and verticals.  Key market imperatives in the adoption of these solutions are speed to market, flexibility, scalability and availability.  We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, technical tools and resources to provide clients with the assessment, migration, integration and managed services required to simplify the cloud adoption decision, whether that decision results in a private, public or hybrid cloud environment.
 
We also continue to invest in our global e-commerce platform, which serves as a single marketplace for our clients to buy and manage anything from a discrete product offering to their cloud and other as-a-service subscriptions.  Components of our e-commerce platform include:
  
• | Customizable client portals, primarily in North America, which allow clients to streamline procurement and processes through a self-service online tool, drive standardization and optimize reconciliation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A focus on small to medium-sized clients, providing them with the ability to learn, solve, buy, and manage cloud products and services via our online experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A similar online experience and capabilities for our larger enterprise clients with added IT as-a-service broker capabilities allowing larger IT organizations to centrally provide cloud offerings while maintaining the manageability and visibility they require.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital Marketing Enablement – We have invested in internal industry and marketing expertise to develop original go to market and IT solution content, whitepapers and industry research studies to ensure we enable our clients with relevant information around IT and business trends.  Further, we leverage a best-in-class digital marketing technology stack to personalize the delivery of our content through an omni-channel experience. Our integrated suite of digital marketing tools has allowed us to access and grow our position in the mid-market over the past few years while also growing our marketing alignment with our partners.
Culture of Business Transformation and Automation – At the heart of our culture is an intense desire to improve our clients’ experience when doing business with us either on the web, through business to business connections or on the telephone.  We have a dedicated business transformation team focused on end to end process improvement initiatives around order flow, dynamic pricing and cost optimization, and back office operations, all oriented to the impact on client experience.  We have invested in process automation and optical recognition scanning solutions to improve certain of our client facing processes, making the buying experience more frictionless while improving the scalability of our business processes for the long term.
Our Offerings
 Our offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services.  Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments consist of largely software and certain software-related services.  On a consolidated basis, hardware, software and services represented approximately 61%, 25% and 14%, respectively, of our net sales in 2020.  This compares to 60%, 27% and 13%, respectively, of our net sales in 2019 and 61%, 27% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales in 2018.  Additional detailed sales mix information by operating segment can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Cloud and Data Center Transformation – Consumption-based models and technology convergence
 are reinventing decades-old approaches to IT infrastructure. We assess, align, manage and secure our clients’ data and workloads, defining and executing platform strategies for optimized IT environments. Our end-to-end services empower companies to effectively leverage technology solutions to overcome challenges, support growth and innovation, reduce risk, and transform the business.

• | Data center and cloud transformation: Modernizing and optimizing IT across the business. Our services span hybrid cloud, migration and consolidation, workload-platform alignment, converged/hyperconverged solutions, and software-defined data center.

We offer a full range of services to clients including discovery, transformation, adoption and management.  We deliver secure, managed solutions in three domains:

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 
 
• | Digital Workspace: Desktop, notebook, tablet and mobile devices coupled with cloud-based productivity and collaboration software, provisioned and deployed in a “as-a-service” model and remotely managed by Insight.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Workplace Services: Full support of end users and their technology including virtual technical support, remote service desk and automated self-service.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Product Lifecycle: Ability to procure, stage, provision, manage and dispose of hardware assets including overnight “hot-swap” to enable remote workers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supply Chain Optimization – As mentioned earlier, our three solution areas are supported by the foundation of our technology supply chain optimization tools and services.  Growing pressure on IT budgets and increasing trends in outsourcing of non-core functions are changing the way clients approach procurement and management of core IT investments.  We provide end-to-end lifecycle services around hardware and software that help our clients optimize their IT return on investments.

• | Hardware Life Cycle: Source, procure, stage, configure, integrate, test, deploy, refurbish and redeploy IT products spanning endpoints to infrastructure, regionally, or across the globe via the Insight footprint and an engaged network of suppliers.

• | Hardware Warranty and Software Maintenance: Warranty and maintenance services covering an array of products that can be purchased as a point solution or as a managed service delivered by Insight.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hardware Product Offerings
We offer products from hundreds of manufacturers, including such industry leaders as Cisco, Dell/EMC, HP Inc., Lenovo, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”), NetApp, Apple, Microsoft and IBM.  Our scale and purchasing power, combined with our efficient, high-volume and cost effective direct sales and marketing model, allow us to offer competitive prices.  We believe that offering choices from multiple partners enables us to better serve our clients by providing a variety of product solutions to address their specific business needs.
 In addition to our distribution facilities, we have “direct-ship” programs with many of our partners, including manufacturers and distributors, allowing us to expand our product offerings without increasing inventory, handling costs or inventory warehousing risk exposure.  As a result, we are able to offer billions of dollars of products in virtual inventory in fulfilling our performance obligations to our clients.  Convenience and product options among multiple brands are key competitive advantages compared to manufacturers’ direct selling programs, which are generally limited to their own brands and may not offer clients a complete or best-in-class solution across all product categories.
 Software Product Offerings
 
Our clients acquire software applications from us in the form of licensing agreements with software publishers or boxed products.  We offer products from hundreds of publishers, including such industry leaders as Microsoft, VMware, Adobe, IBM Software, Symantec and Citrix.  
 As software publishers choose different models for implementing licensing agreements, businesses must evaluate the alternatives to ensure that they select the appropriate agreements and comply with the publishers’ licensing terms when purchasing and managing their software licenses.  With many publishers now offering public cloud-based software solutions in place of licenses consumed on premise, we expect we will continue to see migration to the cloud-based software alternatives discussed above in our services offerings.
 Our Information Technology Systems
 We have committed significant resources to the IT systems that we own and use to manage our business and believe that our success is dependent upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our clients based on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems.  Because these systems affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, partner relationships and programs, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and our voice and data

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 
networks, we have built redundancy into certain systems, maintain system outage policies and procedures and have comprehensive data backup.  We are focused on driving improvements in sales productivity through upgraded IT systems to support higher levels of client satisfaction and new client acquisition, as well as garnering efficiencies in our business.  
 We operate under a single, standardized IT system across North America and APAC and a separate, single IT system platform in all countries in our EMEA operations.  We have completed the integration of the PCM business to our IT system platforms.  In 2021 we plan to migrate our EMEA operations to the same IT system used in North America and APAC.
 For a discussion of risks associated with our IT systems, see “Risk Factors – Risks related to Our Technology, Data and Intellectual Property – Disruptions in our IT systems and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Our Competition
 
The IT hardware, software and services industry is very fragmented and highly competitive.  Our competition includes:
 
 
• | Solution providers, value-added resellers and direct marketers such as CDW, Zones, Connection, SHI, Softchoice, Systemax, Computacenter, Bechtle, SoftwareONE, and Crayon;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Systems integrators such as ePlus, Presidio, World Wide Technology, Perficient and Accenture;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specialty retailers, aggregators, distributors, and to a lesser extent, national computer retailers, computer superstores, Internet-only computer providers, consumer electronics and office supply superstores and mass merchandisers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product manufacturers, such as Dell, HP Inc., IBM, Lenovo and HPE;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Software publishers, such as IBM, Microsoft and Symantec;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | National and global service providers, such as IBM Global Services and HP Enterprise Services; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E-tailers, such as Amazon Web Services, Newegg, Rakuten and e-Buyer (United Kingdom).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The competitive landscape in the industry is continually changing as various competitors expand their product and services offerings.  In addition, emerging models such as cloud computing are creating new competitors and opportunities in messaging, infrastructure, security, collaboration and other services offerings, and, as with other areas, we compete both with resellers and directly with manufacturers, publishers or other service providers for many of these offerings.  Many of our manufacturer and publisher partners are also our competitors, as many sell directly to business customers, particularly larger corporate customers.
 For a discussion of risks associated with the actions of our competitors, see “Risk Factors – Risks related to Our Business, Operations and Industry – The IT hardware, software and services industry is intensely competitive, and actions of our competitors, including manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.  
 Our Partners
 We partner with market leaders offering the top technology brands as well as emerging entrants in the marketplace.  During 2020, we purchased products and software from approximately 6,000 partners.  Approximately 64% (based on dollar volume) of these purchases were directly from manufacturers or software publishers, with the balance purchased through distributors.  Purchases from Microsoft and Tech Data (a distributor) accounted for approximately 21% and 11%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2020.  No other partner accounted for more than 10% of purchases in 2020.  Our top five partners as a group for 2020 were Microsoft, Tech Data, Dell, Ingram Micro (a distributor) and Cisco Systems, and approximately 56% of our total purchases during 2020 came from this group of partners.  Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of our product categories such that, with the exception of Microsoft, we are not dependent on any single partner for sourcing products.    
 10

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. 
 
During 2020, sales of Microsoft and Dell products accounted for approximately 19% and 14%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.  No other manufacturer’s or publisher’s products accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2020.  Sales of product from our top five manufacturers/publishers as a group (Microsoft, Dell, Cisco Systems, HP Inc. and Lenovo) accounted for approximately 57% of our consolidated net sales during 2020.
We obtain incentives from certain product manufacturers, software publishers and distribution partners based typically upon the volume of sales or purchases of their products and services.  In other cases, such incentives may be in the form of participation in our partner programs, which may require specific services or activities with our clients, discounts, marketing funds, price protection or rebates.  Manufacturers and publishers may also provide mailing lists, contacts or leads to us.  We believe that these incentives (or partner funding) and other marketing assistance allow us to increase our marketing reach and strengthen our relationships with leading manufacturers and publishers.  
 We are focused on understanding our partners’ objectives and developing plans and programs to grow our mutual businesses.  We have invested in our digital marketing capabilities over the past four years.  These digital marketing investments increase the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and client interactions.  We believe that we are emerging as a leader in our industry in digital marketing, delivering an outstanding service experience to our clients.  We implemented business intelligence tools that enable us to track performance in this area and demonstrate the return on our partners’ investments with us.  We measure partner satisfaction regularly and hold quarterly business reviews with our largest partners to review business results from the prior quarter, discuss plans for the future and obtain feedback.  Additionally, we host annual partner forums in North America, EMEA and APAC to articulate our plans for the upcoming year.
 As we move into new service areas, we may become even more reliant on certain partner relationships.  For a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on partners, see “Risk Factors – Risks related to Our Business, Operations and Industry – We rely on our partners for product availability, competitive products to sell and marketing funds and purchasing incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the requirements year over year,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Our Teammates
 Successful execution of our business strategy and strategic initiatives involves attracting, developing and retaining teammates who share our core values: hunger, heart and harmony.  The experience, knowledge and dedication of our teammates help drive our operating results.  Management regularly evaluates and enhances internal processes, technologies and teammate benefits in order to maintain engaged teammates and drive client satisfaction, productivity and efficiency.   
 Various ways that we attract, develop and retain qualified and motivated teammates include:
 
 
• | Insight continues to make strides in becoming an employer of choice and has received honors all around the globe.

consist of approximately 1,200 active members. Those four groups hosted more than 70 events in 2020 and highlighted the concerns of diverse teammates at the Company. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Teammate Pulse Survey has ranked Diversity as our #1 scoring category for the past three years. In the Fortune Best Workplaces process, we learned that “Justice” was rated as the highest category by our teammates – the extent to which employees perceive that management promotes inclusive behavior, avoids discrimination, and is committed to providing fair appeal. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our leaders carefully review and monitor our Teammate Pulse Survey results year over year and create action plans to increase teammate engagement. We have seen positive trending over the last five years, and are proud of the culture at Insight. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | To support teammates and their families in crisis situations, the Company provides financial support through its charitable foundation, which has received millions in contributions over the last six years from Insight and its teammates.

• | Insight offers all teammates two paid Heart Days annually to volunteer their time to charitable organizations in the communities where we live and work.

 As of December 31, 2020, we employed 11,006 teammates.  Our teammates by operating segment were as follows: 
 
 
Operating Segment | Number of Teammates | 
------------------+---------------------+------
North America | | 8,719
EMEA | | 1,875
APAC | | 412 

 Our teammates in the United States are not represented by a labor union.  Our workforces in certain foreign countries, such as the Netherlands, have worker representative committees or work councils with which we maintain strong relationships.  We believe our relations with our teammates are good, and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage.  
 Our teammates by job function were as follows:
 
 
Job Function | Number of Teammates | 
-----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+------
Sales | | 3,380
Skilled, certified consulting and service delivery professionals | | 4,410
Total client facing teammates | | 7,790
Management, support services and administration | | 2,820
Distribution | | 396

• | business clients, particularly larger enterprise businesses in the United States, tend to spend more in our fourth quarter and less in the first quarter;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales to public sector clients in the United Kingdom are often stronger in our first quarter.

 These trends create overall seasonality in our consolidated results such that sales and profitability are expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the year.

Our Backlog
 The majority of our backlog historically has been and continues to be open cancelable purchase orders.  We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is predictive of future results. 
Our Intellectual Property
 We do not maintain a traditional research and development group, but we do seek to establish and protect our intellectual property through different forms of intellectual property protection, including trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other protections that apply in the United States and select foreign countries where we believe it is appropriate to seek such protection, under applicable laws.  We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by non-disclosure policies and agreements, as applicable, with teammates, clients, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights.  There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringers in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in our industry and uncertainties in the legal process makes our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees. Our principal trademark is a registered mark, and we also license certain of our proprietary intellectual property rights to third parties.  We have registered a number of domain names, applied for registration of other marks in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, and, from time to time, filed patent applications.  We believe our trademarks, in particular, have significant value, and we continue to invest in their promotion and protection. 
 For a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors – We may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
