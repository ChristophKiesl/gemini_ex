Item 1 - Business Overview
Turtle Beach Corporation, headquartered in San Diego, California and incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2010, is a premier audio technology company with expertise and experience in developing, commercializing and marketing innovative products across a range of large addressable markets under the Turtle Beach® and HyperSound® brands. Turtle Beach is a worldwide leading provider of feature-rich headset solutions for use across multiple platforms, including video game and entertainment consoles, handheld consoles, personal computers, tablets and mobile devices. HyperSound technology is an innovative patent-protected sound technology that delivers immersive, directional audio offering unique potential benefits in a variety of commercial settings and consumer devices, including improved clarity and comprehension for listeners with hearing loss.
VTB Holdings, Inc. (“VTBH”), the parent holding company of the historical headset business, was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2010 with operations principally located in Valhalla, New York. Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. (“VTB”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1975. 
The Company's stock is traded on NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol HEAR.
Headset Business
Turtle Beach launched its first gaming headset in 2005 and has grown to be the leading brand in gaming audio, and designs and markets premium audio peripherals for video game consoles, personal computers and mobile devices, including headsets for PlayStation®4 consoles and officially-licensed headsets for the Xbox One consoles. Turtle Beach branded headsets are distributed internationally across North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia, and sold at thousands of storefronts, including major retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, Game, GameStop, EB Games, Target, and Walmart.
We offer a variety of headsets, spanning multiple wired and wireless retail price points ranging from $20 to $300 and have offerings across all major gaming platforms. Our price tiers correspond to customer profiles, beginning with “Entry-Level” gamers and progressing through “Casual,” “Enthusiast” and “Core.” Each successive price tier incorporates a higher level of finishing, features and technology, progressing from passive mono to amplified stereo, surround sound, and programmable surround sound. Premium headsets have padded leather headbands, accent stitching, and noise-isolating memory foam ear cups. Other features in certain of our premium headsets include removable microphones, breakaway cables and “charge-and-play” batteries that allow gamers to continue playing even as they recharge their batteries. As gaming consoles have evolved from dedicated video game platforms to home entertainment hubs, and as mobile devices have become platforms for entertainment, we have continued to evolve our headsets to reflect how content is consumed.
Each headset model is designed for a “primary” platform, such as a specific console or for the PC platform, though many can be used with multiple platforms, and most are compatible with mobile devices. A primary platform and unique packaging often results in the products being represented in the applicable platform area by retailers, increasing the prominence of Turtle Beach products in physical retail locations and online catalogs.
Turtle Beach was the leading console gaming headset manufacturer in the U.S. with a 42% dollar share of the market, as noted by the December 2016 sales tracking data from The NPD Group, Inc, with four of the Top 5 third-party headsets for both the Xbox One and PlayStation®4.
Our 2016 was highlighted by:

• | Entered competitive gaming audio gear market with the Elite Pro Headset, which includes the groundbreaking ComforTec™ Fit System, and partnered with top professional eSports organizations, OpTic Gaming and FaZe Clan;


• | Launched Stealth 350VR headset, the first and only headset created specifically for use with the new virtual reality devices like PlayStation®VR, HTC Vive™; and


• | Launched Stream Mic, a professional-quality desktop microphone created for gamers livestreaming from their consoles.

HyperSound Business
HyperSound technology is a pioneering audio solution that provides an effective means of projecting sound in a highly directional manner, without use of large speaker arrays, to a specific location creating a precise audio zone. HyperSound directs a beam of audio to targeted listeners in a specific spot, delivering an immersive, 3D-like audio experience. The Company sells HyperSound Professional Audio Solutions, which is being purchased for commercial retail environments where a targeted zone of sound is desired.

We believe our technology offers a number of advantages over regular audio speakers, including:

• | the ability to create a beam of sound and place it where it is intended;


• | the ability to deliver a beam of sound over longer distances; and


• | the ability to penetrate other competing ambient sounds to more effectively communicate.

HyperSound Glass, unveiled in June 2016, is similar in design to touchscreen glass, where there are multiple layers of transparent materials and electronics working in conjunction with the glass. For HyperSound Glass, the glass pane is layered with a set of transparent films allowing it to generate a beam of ultrasound that delivers crisp, clear audio to the targeted listener.
In September 2016, we started the process of restructuring the HyperSound business and winding down direct sales of the HyperSound Clear™ 500P product, in an effort to reduce costs and align spending with revenues, while continuing to pursue certain additional opportunities, including licensing the technology for HyperSound Glass and other applications. 
Industry Overview 
Gaming Headset Market
Sales in the gaming accessories market, which includes headsets and other peripherals such as gamepads, specialty controllers, adapters, batteries, memory and interactive gaming toys are heavily dependent on the global video game industry. In 2013, the gaming industry experienced a cyclical event as Microsoft and Sony each announced new consoles for the first time in eight years, and the consumer response to the Xbox One and PlayStation®4 (the “new generation” or “new-gen” consoles) has been overwhelmingly positive, creating a new installed base of gamers and a market for new-gen headsets.
When new console platforms are introduced into the market, changes to their platforms impact how headset connect with or work with the new consoles and, such as with the most recent consoles, required a transition of console gaming headsets and consumers reduced their purchases of game console peripherals and accessories, including headsets, for old generation console platforms in anticipation of the new platforms becoming available.
The October 2016 Intelligence: Worldwide Console Forecast report by DFC Intelligence Forecasts, or “DFC,” estimates that cumulative new generation consoles are expected to exceed $65 billion by 2020. While sales of the new-gen consoles have outperformed previous platforms, the overall console gaming market uncharacteristically slowed in the recent holiday season. Sales tracking data from The NPD Group, Inc. indicated that console gaming headset sales in the U.S. were nearly $400 million, up slightly from prior year, as consumer deferred purchases ahead of mid-cycle console refreshes and a limited line up of multi-player games.
We believe next year will be a key point in the evolution of the console landscape. Following the recent PlayStation®4 Slim and Pro releases, Microsoft's Xbox One Scorpio, with a focus on high-end 4K and VR gaming, potentially provides the opportunity to combine the console and the rapidly growing PC gaming market through cross-platform initiatives. 
HyperSound Markets
Hearing Health Care. Gradual hearing loss can affect individuals of all ages, varying from mild to profound and is a growing, widespread issue. In the United States, there are nearly 50 million people with some degree of hearing loss significant enough to require a hearing aid. HyperSound technology offers a fundamentally new way to deliver sound, and research indicates that it improves sound clarity and speech intelligibility, particularly for those with hearing loss.
Commercial. We are currently marketing our HyperSound technology to retailers and audio-visual integrators for use in settings where directed audio and sound zones are beneficial, such as digital signage and interactive retail displays. Convenience retailers and fast moving consumer good brands face ever-greater challenges as competition for customers intensifies, and as shoppers increasingly rely on in-store cues. As a result, digital signage is a growing form of direct advertising, capturing an increasing share of advertising spending as restaurants, banks, retail outlets, museums and other outlets and organizations employ commercial displays to communicate with patrons. 
Consumer Applications. Our HyperSound technology has the potential to be developed into consumer products for various applications, including computers, video game consoles, televisions, home theater and home audio. With the advent of flat panel displays for use in televisions and mobile devices, manufacturers have been focused on creating thinner products often at the expense of sound quality. We believe that our ability to create a 3D sound image from two thin emitters, compared to a five- or seven-speaker surround sound set-up using conventional speakers can deliver a compelling and enhanced audio experience.

Business Strategy
We intend to build upon the Turtle Beach brand awareness, sophisticated audio technology and high quality products to grow the core console and casual gaming business to increase sales and profitability.

• | Console Headset Market Share Growth. We believe that our brand's image among consumers is a competitive advantage and that our success is attributable to our emphasis on delivering the highest quality, most innovative headsets. 

To maintain our competitive position in our markets, we are focused on the following:

• | continuing to deliver innovative, high quality console gaming headsets that incorporate advanced audio and wireless technology;


• | growing our gaming headset business in all areas including personal computer headsets;


• | maintaining our strategic relationships that provide our brand a larger presence with consumers and create opportunities for retailers to carry our products;


• | continuing to improve our cost position through increased global sourcing and expanded points of distribution.


• | Expand Our Product Lines. We intend to increase our sales by continuing to develop internally, or through potential acquisitions, products that we offer to our customers. In 2016, we launched new products in two small markets in virtual reality and live streaming that we believe have rapid growth potential. We continue to invest in the resources necessary to maintain and expand our technical capability to manufacture multiple product lines that incorporate the latest technologies. 


• | Accelerate International Expansion. We have a strong gaming headset market position in North America, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Australia, and, as part of our long-term strategy, believe there are additional growth opportunities in Latin America and Asia. In particular in China, under a Chinese language version of the Turtle Beach brand and logo, phonetically pronounced “Huan Jing” (translates as “Fantasy Space"), where we believe there is a potential growth opportunity in the personal computer market as well as the console market following the Chinese government lifting its ban on video game consoles in September 2013. 


• | Develop HyperSound License Model. This is expected to require less capital compared to internal development efforts in recent years while still allowing for revenue generating opportunities, including (i) the technology for HyperSound Glass, (ii) commercial retail display sales and (iii) hearing related and other applications. 

Product Development 
We continue to innovate, make improvements to our technology and develop new products, and anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the near future. Our product management team takes a disciplined approach to product design that balances iteration, incremental improvement and innovation to achieve a blend of differentiated technology designed to attract customers, maintain product design continuity and exceed expectations as to quality, reliability and profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $8.3 million in the continued expansion of our new generation headset portfolio including the launch of the Stealth 350VR, Elite Pro headsets and Stream Mic, professional-quality live streaming microphone as well as product development efforts around HyperSound Glass. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we expended $11.6 million and $9.4 million, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We operate in industries where innovations, investment in new ideas and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are critical to success. We have a substantial base of intellectual property assets to protect our current and future product development, such as key innovations in gaming headsets as well as all of the core technology areas behind HyperSound, and intend to vigorously enforce such rights.
As a third-party gaming headset company certain technology used in the new generation of consoles, such as integrated voice and chat audio from the Xbox One, requires a license to enable products to connect to that platform. While Playstation®4 does not require any license to produce headsets that can connect, certain connections on the Xbox One require the purchase of proprietary chips to integrate into the locked chat audio.
While we currently believe that we have the necessary licenses, or can obtain the necessary licenses to produce compatible products, there is no guarantee that licenses will be renewed or granted. Moreover, if these licensing parties enter into exclusive license agreements with companies other than us for their “closed systems” or if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these headset adapters or chips, we would be placed at a competitive disadvantage.

Supply Chain and Operations
We have a global network of suppliers that manufacture products to meet our cost objectives and quality standards sought by our customers. We have worked closely with component, manufacturing and global logistic partners to build a supply chain that we consider predictable, scalable and consistent to provide high-quality, reliable products and leading cost management practices. The use of outsourced manufacturing facilities is designed to take advantage of specific expertise and allow for flexibility and scalability to respond to seasonality and changing demands for our products.
In anticipation of new product development and incremental growth, we made additional investments with a focus on making advancements to our planning systems. In connection with our initiative to improve our operating efficiency and reduce costs, we have continued efforts to focus on company-wide overhead reduction activities including right-sizing our supply chain, consolidation of warehouses with our global logistics partnership with Keuhne & Nagel as well as the planned transition of our European warehouse to a third-party logistics provider in 2017.
We believe we have solid relationships with our suppliers and that, subject to the discussion in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,” we will continue to have a sufficient supply of quality products on satisfactory terms.
Retail Distribution
Our headsets are sold in over 40 countries, by retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, Game, GameStop, EB Games, Target, and Walmart. We often have a broader assortment and more shelf space than competitors at video game and electronics retailers such as GameStop and Best Buy which we believe reinforces the brand’s authenticity with gaming enthusiasts, and our presence in mass channel retailers such as Walmart and Target enables the brand to reach a wider audience of casual gamers. Our established presence on Amazon.com and other online retail sites, and positive consumer product ratings on those sites, increases the search visibility of our products and helps to influence both online and in-store sales.
Turtle Beach UK serves as a primary sales office for the European market, and has strengthened Turtle Beach’s European operations with support for sales, marketing, customer service and distribution.
TurtleBeach.com is an important focal point for our marketing efforts serving as a destination for paid and earned media. Earned media is favorable publicity gained through promotional efforts other than advertising, as compared with paid media, which refers to publicity gained through advertising. The website acts as a hub for both online and offline activity, and provides a direct sales channel for new and refurbished products.

During 2016, we began to improve our international structure by taking retailers across Europe direct, leveraging off our new warehousing facility and simplifying our distribution model to provide less risk and lower infrastructure costs. In 2017, the Company believes this new model will provide significant growth in the European markets.

Seasonality
Our gaming headset business is seasonal with a significant portion of sales and profits typically occurring around the holiday period. Historically, more than 50% of headset business revenues are generated during the period from September through December as new headsets are introduced and consumers engage in holiday shopping. In addition, launches of major new online multiplayer games and specific retailer purchasing behavior can drive significant revenue shifts between months and quarters in a given year.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, Turtle Beach had 172 employees, of which 150 were full-time salaried employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
