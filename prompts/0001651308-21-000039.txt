Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a global, commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, manufacturing, and commercializing innovative medicines to improve treatment outcomes and expand access for patients worldwide. 
Our research organization has delivered ten molecules into the clinic in our first ten years, including our two lead commercial medicines, BRUKINSA®, a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (“BTK”) for the treatment of various blood cancers, and tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy for the treatment of various solid tumor and blood cancers. We are marketing BRUKINSA® in the world’s two largest pharmaceutical markets, the United States and China, and tislelizumab in China, with an established, science-based commercial organization. We have built state-of-the-art biologic and small molecule manufacturing facilities in China to support the potential future demand of our products, and we also work with high quality contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) to manufacture our internally developed clinical and commercial products.
We are a leader in China-inclusive global clinical development, which we believe can facilitate faster and more cost-effective development of innovative medicines. Our internal clinical development capabilities are deep, including a more than 1,600-person global clinical development team that is running more than 60 ongoing or planned clinical trials. This includes more than 25 pivotal or registration-enabling trials for three product candidates that have enrolled more than 12,000 patients and healthy volunteers, of which approximately one-half have been outside of China, as of January 2021. We have over 45 products and product candidates in commercial stage or clinical development, including 7 approved medicines, 5 pending approval, and over 30 in clinical development.
Supported by our development and commercial capabilities, we have entered into collaborations with world-leading biopharmaceutical companies such as Amgen and Novartis to develop and commercialize innovative medicines globally. Since our inception in 2010 in Beijing, we have become a fully integrated global organization of over 5,300 employees in 14 countries and regions, including China, the United States, Europe and Australia.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to provide access to high-quality, innovative, impactful, and affordable medicines to billions more people globally. We believe that we have built competitive advantages in research, clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization that will drive our business into the future. We intend to continue to develop and expand our competitive advantages and become a global leader by focusing on the following key strategic imperatives: 
1.Research and innovation focus. We have built one of the largest research teams in China with more than 450 people and a robust suite of capabilities that fuel our innovation pipeline. To date, our research organization has advanced more than 10 internally discovered molecules into the clinic and, of those programs, two medicines have been approved for commercial use in multiple indications. Our team has discovered promising new drug candidates, including our investigational TIGIT antibody and BCL-2 inhibitor currently in development. We plan to continue to invest in research and innovation with the aim of discovering additional innovative product candidates for patients.
2.World class clinical development. We believe that leveraging our leadership position in China-inclusive clinical development will enable us to develop products with advantages in speed and cost efficiency, while maintaining quality. We plan to continue to invest to in-source our clinical capabilities to mitigate the challenges associated with relying on third-party contract research organizations ("CROs"), with the intention of becoming one of the best clinical development organizations in the world.
3.China commercial leadership. We have built a large commercial team in China, with over 2,200 colleagues spread across the country and organized under experienced executive leadership. We believe that we have established BeiGene as a high-quality, science-driven, leading provider of innovative and affordable medicines in China. We aspire to grow our commercial portfolio through both internal discovery efforts and through in-licensing additional products and product candidates, striving to be a partner of choice and creating mutual benefits with our partners wherever possible. We believe that our commercial capabilities in China, coupled with our China-inclusive clinical development capabilities conducted at global-quality standards, enable us to attract favorable in-licensing 
opportunities. We plan to further invest in our China commercial organization and create advantages in scale, speed, and quality to establish our commercial leadership in China. 
4.Global leadership, access, and reputation. We have launched BRUKINSA® in the United States and built a targeted commercial team focused on medical thought leaders in blood cancer treatments. This competitive foothold is based on the clinical differentiation of our approved products and product candidates and our deep relationships. We aspire to establish our reputation globally as a leading biotechnology company by delivering highly effective and differentiated medicines in the United States, China, Europe and new markets.
5.Broad accessibility. We believe that our commercial scale in China, potentially lower upfront development costs through China-inclusive clinical development, sizeable portfolio of innovative therapies, and overall commercial expertise in serving large, underserved populations give us a unique advantage and create an opportunity for us to be an early mover in providing innovative medicines at affordable prices to many geographies that are not traditionally the focus for pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. We plan to focus our long-term strategy on seeking approvals of our portfolio compounds globally and building clinical development and commercial capabilities in these markets, either alone or through our collaborators.

We commercialize the following internally developed cancer medicines:
BRUKINSA
BRUKINSA® is a second-generation small molecule BTK inhibitor designed to maximize BTK occupancy and minimize off-target binding effects. We are marketing BRUKINSA® in the U.S. and China. BRUKINSA® received accelerated approval in the United States as a treatment for MCL in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy (November 2019), as well as conditional approval in China for adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy and adult patients with CLL or SLL who have received at least one prior therapy (June 2020). 
In China, we have filed a supplemental new drug application ("sNDA") for BRUKINSA® for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory ("R/R") Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia ("WM"), and that application is pending under priority review. We have also filed additional applications for approval in the European Union ("EU"), Australia and Canada, for R/R WM and Australia, Canada and Israel for R/R mantle cell lymphoma ("MCL"). In December 2020, we announced inclusion of BRUKINSA® in the updated National Reimbursement Drug List ("NRDL") by the China National Healthcare Security Administration ("NHSA") for BRUKINSA®’s approved indications.
Market Opportunity and Competition
Lymphomas are blood-borne cancers involving lymphatic cells of the immune system. They can be broadly categorized into non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma ("NHL") and Hodgkin’s lymphoma ("HL"). Depending on the origin of the cancer cells, lymphomas can also be characterized as B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. B-cell lymphomas make up approximately 85% of NHLs and comprise a variety of specific diseases involving B-cells at differing stages of maturation or differentiation. According to statistics from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, there were 77,240 new NHL cases and 19,940 deaths in 2020 in the United States, and of these NHL cases the incidence of CLL was 21,040 cases and there were 4,060 deaths from CLL. Similar SEER analyses calculated U.S. incidence rates of 3,000 for MCL and 1,350 for WM. According to the China National Central Cancer Registry ("NCCR"), International Agency for Research on Cancer ("IARC"), and Frost and Sullivan ("F&S") research, in China, the number of new cases of NHL reached 90,000 in 2019. The compound annual growth rate from 2015 to 2019 was 2.6%, and the number of new cases of NHL is expected to reach 102,000 and 116,000 in 2024 and 2030, respectively. In China, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ("DLBCL") is the most common NHL subtype, accounting for 41.0%, while follicular lymphoma and MCL are the other two largest subtypes of lymphoma, accounting for 6.1% and 3.4%, respectively. 
Conventional methods of treating lymphomas vary according to the specific disease or histology, but generally include chemotherapy, antibodies directed at CD20, a molecular marker found on the surface of B-cells, and, less frequently, radiation. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new therapies for lymphomas, including BTK inhibitors, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ("PI3K") inhibitors, idelalisib, copanlisib and duvelisib, and the Bcl-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. 
The BTK inhibitor IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in 2013 for the treatment of patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Since that time, ibrutinib has received supplemental FDA approvals for the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL, CLL/SLL patients with 17p deletion, patients with WM, patients with marginal zone lymphoma ("MZL") who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy, patients with chronic graft versus host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, in combination with rituximab in WM, and in combination with obinutuzumab in CLL/SLL. Ibrutinib is also approved by the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") for the treatment of patients with MCL, CLL and WM. Ibrutinib has been approved in over 90 countries and regions, and it was approved and launched in China at the end of 2017 for the treatment of patients with R/R CLL/SLL and R/R MCL. Subsequently, in July 2018, ibrutinib was also approved for first-line CLL/SLL. Another BTK inhibitor, CALQUENCE® (acalabrutinib), was approved by the FDA in 2017 under accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy, and in November 2019 for use in adults with CLL/SLL as a single agent or in combination with obinutuzumab. In 2020, global revenues for BTK inhibitors were approximately $7.1 billion according to published reports.
Tislelizumab
Tislelizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 ("PD-1") that we specifically designed to minimize binding to Fc receptor gamma ("FcγR"), which is believed to play an essential role in activating phagocytosis in macrophages, to minimize its negative impact on T effector cells. We are evaluating tislelizumab in a broad pivotal clinical program for both solid tumor and hematological indications, both globally and in China. Tislelizumab is approved in China for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma ("cHL") who have received at least two prior therapies (December 2019); the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing 
chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy (April 2020); and the first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC") in combination with chemotherapy (January 2021). In addition, we have filed sNDAs in China for tislelizumab for first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy and for previously treated patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ("HCC"). In December 2020, we announced the inclusion of tislelizumab in the updated NRDL by the China NHSA in tislelizumab’s approved cHL and UC indications.
In January 2021, we announced a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to develop, manufacture and commercialize tislelizumab in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the EU, UK, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Russia and Japan (the "Novartis Territory"). The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Upon closing of the collaboration, we will receive an upfront payment of $650 million and are eligible to receive up to $1.3 billion in regulatory milestones, $250 million in potential sales milestones and royalties on future sales of tislelizumab in the Novartis Territory. We retained worldwide rights to commercialize our proprietary products in combination with tislelizumab.
Market Opportunity and Competition
A number of PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody medicines have been approved by the FDA. These include Merck’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), BMS’s OPDIVO® (nivolumab), Roche’s TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab), AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI® (durvalumab), Pfizer and Merck Sereno’s BAVENCIO® (avelumab), and Regeneron and Sanofi’s LIBTAYO® (cemiplimab). In the global setting, several PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody agents are in late-stage clinical development in addition to tislelizumab, such as GlaxoSmithKline’s dostarlimab and Pfizer’s sasanlimab. In China, as of February 1, 2021, there are five other approved PD-1 antibodies, OPDIVO® (nivolumab) and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), as well as Junshi’s TUOYI (toripalimab), Innovent’s TYVYT (sintilimab), and Hengrui’s AIRUIKA® (camrelizumab), and there are two approved PD-L1 antibody agents AstraZeneca's IMFINZI® (durvalumab) and Roche's TECENTRIQ® (atezolizomab). There are approximately 40 more PD-1 and PD-L1 agents in clinical development in China.
Globally, the top four PD-1/PD-L1 antibody medicines had sales of approximately $26.5 billion in 2020 based on public reports. We believe that there is a large commercial opportunity in China for PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody medicines. Currently available clinical data suggest that some of the most prevalent cancers in China, such as lung, gastric, liver and esophageal cancer, are responsive to this class of agents. According to the World Health Organization's GLOBOCAN online database, in 2018 China suffered 39%, 50%, 47%, and 56% of all deaths from lung, gastric, liver, and esophageal cancers, respectively, in the world. Collectively, these four tumor types comprised over 2.3 million new cases in 2016 in China alone, according to Chen et al. 2016. In addition, China has a higher proportion of PD-1 responsive tumors in its total annual cancer incidence in comparison to other geographies like the United States or Europe. According to Chen et al. 2016, the annual incidence of the top ten PD-1 responsive tumors in China is estimated to be 3.0 million out of 4.3 million in total annual cancer incidence. In comparison, the estimated annual incidence of the top ten PD-1 responsive tumors is 0.9 million out of 1.7 million in total annual cancer incidence in the United States, and 0.9 million out of the 1.8 million total in the EU5 countries (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain and Italy) according to the SEER program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization.
Pamiparib
Pamiparib is an investigational, selective small molecule inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 ("PARP1") and PARP2 enzymes. Pamiparib has demonstrated pharmacological properties such as brain penetration and PARP-DNA complex trapping in preclinical models. We are evaluating pamiparib as a potential monotherapy and in combinations for the treatment of various solid tumors. A new drug application ("NDA") for pamiparib for patients with ovarian cancer ("OC") has been accepted and granted priority review in China by the Center for Drug Evaluation ("CDE") of the NMPA, and is currently pending approval.
Market Opportunity and Competition
Many tumor types have been shown to be responsive to PARP inhibitors, including OC, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer ("GC"). PARP inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging activity both in R/R patients as well as in the maintenance setting. In the United States, in 2020 there were approximately 21,750 new cases of OC, 276,480 new cases of breast cancer, and 27,600 new cases of GC, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute's SEER online database. In China, there were approximately 52,000 new cases of OC, 326,000 new cases of breast cancer, and 456,000 new cases of GC in 2019, according to NCCR, IARC and F&S research. 
A number of PARP inhibitors have been approved by the FDA. These include AstraZeneca’s LYNPARZA® (olaparib), Clovis Oncology’s RUBRACA® (rucaparib), GlaxoSmithKline’s ZEJULA® (niraparib), and Pfizer’s TALZENNA®
(talazoparib). AbbVie’s veliparib is in late-stage development. In 2020, global sales of the PARP class were approximately $2.4 billion according to company reports. In China, AstraZeneca received approval for olaparib in August 2018. Zai Labs obtained development and commercial rights for niraparib in China, and its NDA was approved by the NMPA in December 2019. Fluzoparib from Hengrui/Hansoh was approved in December 2020.
We are currently commercializing, or plan to commercialize, the following cancer medicines in China under an exclusive license from Amgen:
XGEVA
XGEVA® (denosumab) is an antibody-based RANK ligand ("RANKL") inhibitor that was approved globally for the prevention of skeletal-related events ("SREs") in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and in patients with multiple myeloma, and for the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone ("GCTB"). XGEVA® is approved in over 70 countries worldwide. In China, XGEVA® received conditional approval in the GCTB indication in May 2019 and received conditional approval for the SRE indications in November 2020. We began marketing XGEVA® in China in July 2020. In December 2020, we announced the inclusion of XGEVA® in the NRDL for the treatment of GCTB.
GCTB is a relatively rare, benign, but locally aggressive osteolytic skeletal neoplasm of young adults. The patients experience pain, swelling, and limitation of joint movement at the primary site. In China, there were 2,086 new cases of GCTB in 2019, according to the China NCCR, IARC, and F&S research. To date, XGEVA® is the only approved therapy for the treatment of GCTB. For patients with aggressive forms of GCTB, who are not candidates for locoregional therapy, e.g., therapy or radiotherapy, XGEVA® is the preferred treatment option over bisphosphonate, chemotherapy, or interferon. 
Metastases to bone are a common site of cancer recurrence for many solid tumors. Bone metastases cause pain, compromised quality of life, and SREs, which include pathologic fracture, the need for radiation or surgery to bone, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and spinal cord compression. Both XGEVA® and bisphosphonates reduce the morbidity of metastatic bone disease, mainly by decreasing SREs. Similar to bone metastases in patients with solid tumors, multiple myeloma has a major feature of osteolytic bone disease that can lead to severe disability and morbidity, including SREs. XGEVA® is also indicated for the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. 
In China, there are a number of biosimilars for denosumab in clinical development, including from Shandong Boan Biotechnology Co., Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., and Shanghai Henlius Biotech Co.
BLINCYTO
BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab), a bispecific CD-19 directed CD3 T-cell engager, is the first and only approved bi-specific T-cell engager ("BiTE") immunotherapy. It has been approved in 60 countries for use in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ("ALL"). In China, BLINCYTO® received conditional approval as a treatment for adult patients with R/R ALL in December 2020. We expect to begin commercializing BLINCYTO® in the first half of 2021. 
ALL is the most common childhood malignancy and accounts for approximately one-quarter of all childhood malignancies. It is estimated that there are 0.69 cases of ALL in 100,000 people in China, according to the China NCCR, IARC, and F&S research. Approximately 15 percent of children fail initial treatment and advance to R/R stage, and BLINCYTO is indicated for the treatment of patients with R/R B-cell precursor ALL. There are CAR-T therapies being developed for this indication, and tisagenlecleucel from Novartis has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients including and under 25 years of age with B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse. Clofarabine from Sanofi is also approved in this indication by the FDA. Neither of these two agents have been approved in China. 
KYPROLIS
KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib), a proteasome inhibitor, has been approved in over 60 countries for use in patients with R/R multiple myeloma (MM). It has been filed in China as a treatment for patients with MM, and the NDA has been accepted by the NMPA and is pending approval. In the class of proteasome inhibitors, VELCADE® has been marketed by Johnson & Johnson in China since 2006 and NINLARO® (ixazomib) has been marketed by Takeda in China since 2018. There are a number of generic forms of carfilzomib being developed in China by local manufacturers, including Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., and Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. 
We commercialize the following cancer medicines in China under an exclusive license from BMS:
ABRAXANE
ABRAXANE® (paclitaxel albumin-bound particles for injectable suspension) is a solvent-free chemotherapy product which was developed using a proprietary nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab®) technology platform. This protein-bound chemotherapy agent combines paclitaxel with albumin. Globally, ABRAXANE® is approved for uses in breast cancer, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, and GC, with geographic differences in labeling. In China, ABRAXANE® is approved for use in metastatic breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated. It is also approved for use in metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in combination with gemcitabine. 
There were approximately 326,000 new cases of breast cancer and 108,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer in China in 2019, according to the China NCCR, IARC, and F&S research. Targeted therapy, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are three main strategies to treat different types of breast cancer. The taxanes marketed in China include two branded solvent-based formulations of paclitaxel (TAXOL® and ANZATAX®), one branded formulation of docetaxel (TAXOTERE®), one paclitaxel liposome (LIPUSU®), one albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABRAXANE®), and a number of generic forms of solvent-based taxanes and ABRAXANE®, including albumin-bound paclitaxel products from CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited, Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd., Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
On March 25, 2020, the NMPA suspended the importation, sales and use of ABRAXANE® in China supplied to us by BMS. This suspension is based on inspection findings at BMS’s contract manufacturing facility in the United States. We did not have any sales of ABRAXANE® in 2020 following the suspension and do not expect revenue from ABRAXANE® until the NMPA lifts its suspension on the importation, sale and use of ABRAXANE® and qualified medicine is manufactured and available for sale in China. We are working with BMS to restore supply as soon as possible, including through BMS’s remediation efforts at the current manufacturing site and application to qualify an alternative manufacturing site for China supply. We do not know when the NMPA suspension of ABRAXANE® will be lifted and when we will be able to re-commence sales of ABRAXANE® in China. 
REVLIMID
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is an oral immunomodulatory medicine that was approved in China in 2013 for the treatment of multiple myeloma ("MM") in combination with dexamethasone in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. In February 2018, REVLIMID® received NMPA approval of a new indication for the treatment of MM in combination with dexamethasone in adult patients with previously untreated MM who are not eligible for transplant.
In 2019, there were approximately 20,700 new cases of MM in China in 2019, according to the China NCCR, IARC, and F&S research. With a growing aging population and improving diagnosis, China has seen a steady increase in MM incidence. The main treatments for MM in China include VELCADE®, which is a proteasome inhibitor marketed by Johnson & Johnson in China since 2006, REVLIMID®, NINLARO® (ixazomib), an oral proteasome inhibitor developed by Takeda, DARZALEX® (daratumumab), an infusion CD38 monoclonal antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson since 2019, and a number of generic forms of VELCADE® and REVLIMID®, including generic lenalidomide from Shuanglu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. Chinese guidelines recommend lenalidomide as a standard of care for the treatment of R/R and newly diagnosed MM as well as in the maintenance setting.
REVLIMID® was listed on the NRDL in June 2017. In November 2019, we announced that REVLIMID® received formal inclusion on the NRDL in China for R/R multiple myeloma. In November 2020 our sNDA for the use of REVLIMID® in combination with rituximab in adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma was approved by the NMPA.
VIDAZA
VIDAZA® (azacitidine for injection) is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re-expression. VIDAZA® was approved in China in April 2017 for the treatment of intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes ("MDS"), chronic myelomonocyte leukemia ("CMML") and acute myeloid leukemia ("AML") with 20% to 30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia. In January 2018, VIDAZA became commercially available in China.
MDSs are among the most common hematological malignant diseases. In 2019, there were approximately 22,100 new cases of MDS in China in 2019, according to the China NCCR, IARC, and F&S research. The typical age of onset is 70 years. The higher-risk MDS (intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS) is considered fatal because the median overall survival is only 
0.4-1.1 years, and nearly 30% of these patients progress to AML. In China, the main treatments for intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS are conventional care regimen ("CCR") (best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine and intensive chemotherapy), and hypomethylating agents ("HMAs"). DACOGEN® (decitabine), marketed by Johnson & Johnson, was the first HMA agent approved in China in 2009. In the past several years, at least nine decitabine generics have become available. In 2017, decitabine was listed in the NRDL. There are also two approved generic forms of azacitidine from manufacturers Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. and Sichuan Huiyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Nevertheless, there are still over 50% of higher-risk MDS patients treated with CCR, and the unmet need remains large. VIDAZA® is a first-line recommended treatment in the Chinese MDS treatment guidelines. VIDAZA® was listed in the NRDL in October 2018.
We are planning to commercialize the following cancer medicines in China under an exclusive license from EUSA Pharma:
SYLVANT
SYLVANT® (siltuximab), an interleukin-6 ("IL-6") antagonist, was approved as a treatment for patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease ("iMCD") who are human immunodeficiency virus ("HIV") negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. We announced on January 25, 2021 that the biologics license application ("BLA") for siltuximab was accepted by the China NMPA and granted priority review. It is estimated that approximately 6,500 to 7,700 new cases of Castleman disease ("CD") are diagnosed each year in the United States, of which approximately 75% are estimated to be unicentric and the remaining 25% are estimated to be HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman disease ("MCD") or HHV-8-negative/idiopathic MCD. In Japan, the incidence appears to be similar to that seen in the United States; however, in contrast, MCD appears to be more common than unicentric CD, and HHV-8-associated MCD is rare. There are few published data regarding the epidemiology in China, but there are no clear associations between epidemiology and particular ethnicities. SYLVANT® is the preferred treatment for patients with iMCD according to the NCCN guidelines, and when SYLVANT® is not available, tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against the IL6 receptor, could be used to treat iMCD.
QARZIBA
QARZIBA®▼ (dinutuximab beta), a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal GD2 antibody, was approved as a treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response (PR). We announced on November 9, 2020 that the BLA for dinutuximab was accepted by the China NMPA and granted priority review. Neuroblastoma is almost exclusively a disease of children. It is the third most common childhood cancer, after leukemia and brain tumors, and is the most common solid extracranial tumor in children. There are limited publications on the epidemiology of the disease, and it is estimated there are 5-9 cases of neuroblastoma in one million children under the age of 19. High-risk neuroblastoma patients are managed with induction chemotherapy, surgical resection, tandem autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, radiotherapy, and maintenance with biologic/immunologic therapy, e.g., dinutuximab.
 We are planning to commercialize the following product in China under an exclusive license from Bio-Thera:
BAT1706
BAT1706 is an investigational biosimilar to Avastin® (bevacizumab) that is in development by Bio-Thera Solutions, Ltd., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company located in Guangzhou, China. In China, Avastin® is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, liver cancer and NSCLC. 
We have acquired the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize BAT1706 in China, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. BAT1706 is an investigational compound and has not received regulatory approval in any country. The China NMPA accepted the BLA for BAT1706 in June 2020. Bio-Thera has submitted a marketing authorization application ("MAA") to the EMA and submitted a BLA to the FDA in November 2020. In China, two bevacizumab biosimilars have been approved, marked by Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Innovent Biologics, Inc., and there are also a number of bevacizumab biosimilars in development, including by Sunshine Guojian Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc.
Reimbursement and Market Access
Our sales are largely dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement by third party payors. In many markets these third parties are government health systems and in some markets such as the United States there are also private payors such as private health insurers and health systems. During 2020 we commercialized our products in two markets, China and the United States. 
In China there is one main payor, the government’s national health care coverage system, which provides Basic Medical Insurance ("BMI") to the majority (greater than 95%) of China’s approximate 1.4 billion people. There are three types of 
coverage plans in China at the national level that depend on if a resident lives in an urban versus rural setting and if they are employed. The different plans have different characteristics in terms of how the plan is paid for and what it covers. Coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals in China comes under the purview of the NHSA, the National Healthcare Security Administration, which oversees the NRDL. The NRDL is composed of three lists. The ‘A’ and ‘B’ list are commonly referred to as the ‘regular’ lists. The A list generally includes older, off-patent medicines, while the B list generally includes newer medicines, some with remaining patent protection, which are reimbursed at a lower rate compared to the A list. In 2017 a third list was added to the system, often referred to as the ‘C’ list or the ‘negotiation’ list. This list generally includes newer innovative medicines which are accepted on the list after successful negotiation between the NHSA and the company. Typically, inclusion on the C list is accompanied by a discount to the prevailing list price in China for the medicine at the time of inclusion. The NRDL price for a medicine is its prevailing price in China, but the actual price that is used can be modified at the provincial level. In addition to the NRDL, there are provincial reimbursement drug lists, or PRDLs. Provinces have been allowed to omit reimbursement for 10-15% of the products on the NRDL in order to direct resources to other products to better serve their specific populations. This ability is being phased out by 2022 according to a July 2019 NHSA policy memo. The PRDLs are thus, at this time, the official list of what is available to China’s citizens. In addition to insurance reimbursement, patients can elect to self-pay for needed medicines.
Several of BeiGene’s medicines are listed on the NRDL. In the most recent NRDL list announced in December 2020, the following medicines were included in the NRDL, effective March 1, 2021:
•Tislelizumab for the treatment of patients with CHL who received at least two prior therapies (approved in December 2019);
•Tislelizumab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy (approved in April 2020);
•BRUKINSA® for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy (approved in June 2020);
•BRUKINSA® for the treatment of adult patients with CLL/SLL who have received at least one prior therapy (approved in June 2020); and
•XGEVA® for the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with GCTB that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity (Amgen obtained approval of XGEVA in China in May 2019).
Additionally, two of our medicines were listed in past NRDLs: REVLIMID® was included in the 2017 NRDL negotiation list and later received formal inclusion in the 2019 B list, while VIDAZA® was listed in the 2018 NRDL negotiation list and later received formal inclusion to the 2020 B list. 
In 2018, China started a new program to centrally purchase generic medicines for the nation’s health care system called "volume-based procurement", or GPO (group purchasing organization) or "4+7" (4 municipalities and 7 provincial cities) when the program was first piloted in 11 major cities. After the 2018 pilot program, it was implemented nationally in 2019. It is a tender-based system that provides guaranteed volume for lowered pricing. Participation in the program requires a product to have passed a quality consistency evaluation ("QCE"), which in turn requires passing a bioequivalence ("BE") comparison often to the originator product. The system offers a major portion of a market’s volume to winning bidders. More than one company can win a given tender, and more guaranteed volume is awarded as more bidders win. The system is still evolving and, as such, the exact terms of how many bidders win and what amount of volume are won and at what price is also evolving. 
It is common in China for pharmaceutical companies to employ patient assistance programs to help patients afford their innovative medicines. Usually these programs have been offered to patients who are self-paying. A typical program provides a certain number of free doses to patients after a certain number of doses have been paid for. Usually these programs end when a medicine is included in the NRDL. We offer these types of patient assistance programs to our patients. 
In the United States most health insurance coverage is provided by private insurers, often accessed via employer-sponsored plans, and the two main public insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid. All three types of programs usually have some type of coverage for pharmaceutical products. Often this is through a PBM, or pharmacy benefit manager. The structure of the pharmacy benefit can be quite different for different beneficiaries depending on the negotiations between plan sponsors and plan purchasers. There is no central list of covered pharmaceuticals in the United States, as there is no single payer system. As such, the prices paid for pharmaceuticals in the United States can vary.
We offer patient assistance programs in the United States under our myBeiGene program. This program seeks to enhance access to BRUKINSA® by assisting with obtaining reimbursement, co-pay assistance when allowed, temporary supply of free product for insurance delays, and free product assistance for some uninsured and underinsured patients. The programs also seek to support patients and caregivers by providing education and information about BRUKINSA® and its approved indications, nurse advocates, and connecting patients to sources of support such as support groups and transportation/lodging assistance.

Our Commercial- and Clinical-Stage Drug Candidates
A description of our commercial- and clinical-stage drug candidates and clinical data from selected clinical trials is set forth below. Historically, we have made available, and we intend to continue to make available, clinical data and/or topline results from clinical trials of our drug candidates in our press releases and/or filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited ("HKEx"), copies of which are available on the Investors section of our website.
Brukinsa (zanubrutinib), a BTK Inhibitor
We are currently evaluating zanubrutinib in a broad pivotal clinical program globally and in China as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various lymphomas. Zanubrutinib has demonstrated higher selectivity against BTK than IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), an approved BTK inhibitor, based on our biochemical assays; higher exposure than ibrutinib based on their respective Phase 1 experience in separate studies; and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in both the peripheral blood and lymph node compartments in patients. We reported data from our Phase 3 ASPEN study, which compared zanubrutinib with ibrutinib in WM. While the trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint of superiority in complete response and very good partial response (“VGPR”) rates for zanubrutinib compared to ibrutinib, zanubrutinib demonstrated a numerically higher VGPR rate as well as improvements in safety and tolerability.
Mechanism of Action
BTK is a key component of the B-cell receptor ("BCR") signaling pathway and is an important regulator of cell proliferation and cell survival in various lymphomas. BTK inhibitors block BCR-induced BTK activation and its downstream signaling, leading to growth inhibition and cell death in certain malignant white blood cells called B-cells. Zanubrutinib is an orally active inhibitor that covalently binds to BTK, resulting in irreversible inactivation of the enzyme.
Overview of Clinical Development Program and Regulatory Status
We received accelerated approval from the FDA in November 2019 for zanubrutinib for the treatment of adult MCL patients who have received at least one prior therapy. We announced approval from China’s NMPA in June 2020 for use in two indications - the treatment of adult patients with CLL/SLL who have received at least one prior therapy, and the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. 
We have announced filings of BRUKINSA® with regulatory authorities globally, including in the United States, China, the EU, Canada, and Australia for WM, and in Canada, Australia and Israel for MCL. As of February 2021, more than 20 marketing authorization applications for BRUKINSA® have been submitted outside of the United States and China, covering 45 countries and regions, including by BeiGene in the EU and Canada and with support from our five distribution partners: Adium Pharma S.A. in Latin America and the Caribbean, NewBridge Pharmaceuticals in the Middle East and North Africa, Erkim in Turkey, Nanolek in Russia, and Medison in Israel. 
Based on the clinical data to date, we believe that BRUKINSA® has a potentially best-in-class profile, and we are running a broad global pivotal program in multiple indications, including nine registration or registration-enabling clinical trials. Four of the nine studies are Phase 3 and five are designed to be registration-enabling Phase 2 trials.
We have reported results from the monotherapy head-to-head Phase 3 trial versus ibrutinib in WM (ASPEN, NCT03053440), which are being included in several filings globally. We are also conducting an ongoing Phase 3 trial comparing BRUKINSA® to bendamustine and rituximab in patients with treatment-naïve ("TN") CLL/SLL (SEQUOIA, NCT03336333) and a head-to-head Phase 3 trial in R/R CLL/SLL versus ibrutinib (ALPINE, NCT03734016). We have completed patient enrollment in SEQUOIA and ALPINE. Our fourth Phase 3 trial is an ongoing Phase 3 confirmatory trial in patients with TN MCL (NCT04002297). Additionally, we have five filed or ongoing Phase 2 trials that are designed to be registration-enabling, including four monotherapy studies in R/R MCL, R/R WM, R/R CLL/SLL (NCT03206970, NCT03332173, NCT03206918), and R/R MZL (MAGNOLIA, NCT03846427) and an ongoing pivotal Phase 2 trial in combination with GAZYVA® (obinutuzumab) in patients with R/R FL (ROSEWOOD, NCT03332017), which is designed as a pivotal trial for accelerated or conditional approval and will require a confirmatory study if approved. Finally, we are also investigating zanubrutinib in several combination studies in DLBCL and CLL/SLL, including two studies in CLL/SLL investigating venetoclax combinations. 
We continue to pursue regulatory approvals for BRUKINSA® globally. We expect regulatory decisions for some of the filings this year, including those for certain patients with MCL in the EU, Middle East, South America, Canada, Australia, and Russia, and for patients with WM in the United States, EU, Canada and Australia. We expect topline results to be available from two of our Phase 3 studies in CLL/SLL, SEQUOIA (as early as 2021) and ALPINE (first half 2022). The former is examining BRUKINSA® in 1L CLL/SLL against bendamustine plus rituximab, and the latter is a head-to-head study comparing BRUKINSA® versus ibrutinib in second line CLL/SLL. Finally, we expect to complete enrollment in the pivotal Phase 2 ROSEWOOD trial comparing BRUKINSA® plus obinutuzumab to obinutuzumab alone in R/R follicular lymphoma patients in 2021.
Summary of Clinical Results
As of January 2021, we had enrolled more than 3,100 patients in clinical trials of zanubrutinib, including trials of zanubrutinib in combination with other therapies. Our first-in-human study is a multi-center, open-label Phase 1 trial being conducted in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, South Korea and Europe to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties and preliminary activity of zanubrutinib as a monotherapy in patients with different subtypes of B-cell malignancies, such as WM, CLL/SLL, follicular lymphoma ("FL"), and MCL. The initial results of the dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase of this trial demonstrated that, consistent with zanubrutinib’s pharmacokinetic profile, complete and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in the blood was observed in all tested patients, starting at the lowest dose of 40 mg once daily ("QD"). In addition, sustained full BTK occupancy was observed in the lymph nodes with the 160 mg twice-daily ("BID") dosing regimen. We substantially expanded the clinical development program for zanubrutinib based on these early results to include late stage clinical studies in WM, CLL/SLL, MCL, FL and MZL. In addition, we have several studies ongoing in DLBCL, both monotherapy and combinations, and we have several combination studies in CLL, including combinations with the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax and a planned study with our internally-discovered BCL-2 inhibitor, BGB-14417. All of the studies discussed below were presented at major medical conferences and were included in press releases issued at the time of the medical conferences and included in our current reports or announcements filed with the SEC and HKEx, respectively. Those sources have further details on each study.
Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia - ASPEN Study
In December 2019, we announced topline results from our Phase 3 ASPEN trial of zanubrutinib compared to ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with WM. We presented the results of the trial at the 2020 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ("ASCO"). 
The ASPEN trial is a randomized Phase 3 trial in 229 patients with WM conducted in 61 centers in Europe, Australia, and the United States. ASPEN was the largest Phase 3 trial yet conducted in WM and the first comparative trial readout for two BTK inhibitors. Cohort 1 enrolled 201 patients and randomized 102 to receive zanubrutinib and 99 to receive ibrutinib.
The trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint of superiority in CR and VGPR rates for zanubrutinib compared to ibrutinib, but zanubrutinib demonstrated numerically more frequent VGPRs, higher PFS and OS at 12 months, and advantages in safety and tolerability.

 | R/R | Overall 
Efficacy | Zanubrutinib(N = 83) | Ibrutinib(N = 81) | Zanubrutinib(N = 102) | Ibrutinib(N = 99)
VGPR + CR Rate | 28.9%1 | 19.8% | 28.4% | 19.2%2 
PFS (12 month) | 92.4% | 85.9% | 89.7% | 87.2% 
OS (12 month) | 98.8% | 92.5% | 97.0% | 93.9% 

Data cutoff of August 31, 2019, with a median follow-up of 19.4 months. 1. 2-sided p=0.1160, no patients achieved a CR in either arm. 2. 2-sided descriptive p=0.0921, no patients achieved a CR in either arm. 
Zanubrutinib showed a more favorable safety profile overall compared to ibrutinib, as shown in the table below, including overall fewer grade >3 events and less incidence of AEs known to be of interest in BTK inhibitor usage such as atrial fibrillation or flutter.

 | Zanubrutinib | Ibrutinib 
Safety | Overall(n = 101) | Overall(n = 98)
Grade >3 AEs | 58.4% | 63.3% 
Treatment discontinuation due to AEs | 4 (4.0%) | 9 (9.2%) 
Fatal AEs | 1 (1.0%) | 4 (4.1%) 
Atrial fibrillation / flutter of any grade | 2.0% | 15.3% 
Minor bleeding | 48.5% | 59.2% 
Major hemorrhage | 5.9% | 9.2% 
Diarrhea | 20.8% | 31.6% 
Neutropenia | 29.7% | 13.3% 

Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia - ASPEN Study – MYD88WT Cohort
ASPEN enrolled patients with the wild type MYD88 gene, which is believed to result in lower response rates and shorter progression-free survival rates when treated with BTK inhibitors. This cohort of 26 MYD88WT patients were all treated with zanubrutinib (160mg bid). The overall response rate was 80.8%, with a major response rate of 50.0%, including a VGPR rate of 26.9%. The progression-free survival event-free rate at 12 months was 72.4%. The most frequently reported AEs were diarrhea, anemia, contusion, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection. Major hemorrhage was reported in 2 patients, and atrial fibrillation was reported in 1 patient. There were no fatal AEs.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma – SEQUOIA 17p Deletion Arm C
We presented updated results from Arm C of the SEQUOIA trial (NCT03336333). Patients who have the 17p13.1 deletion [del(17p)] have a poor prognosis and respond poorly to standard chemo-immunotherapy. A total of 109 of these patients were enrolled into Arm C of the SEQUOIA trial, a non-randomized arm due to the unfavorable response of these patients to bendamustine plus rituximab. With median follow-up of 21.9 months, the overall response rate was 94.5%, including a CR/CRi rate of 6.4% and a PR/nPR rate of 87.1%. The 18-month PFS rate was 90.6%. Adverse events of interest that were the most common included infections, minor bleeding, bruising and neutropenia (65%, 28%, 25% and 19%).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma - BOVen
Zanubrutinib has been tested in investigator-sponsored studies. One study, called the BOVen study (NCT03824483), investigated the use of zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab and venetoclax in 39 previously untreated CLL/SLL patients. The study investigated if the combination would be able to produce frequent uMRD (undetectable minimal residual disease), thus allowing for an MRD-driven treatment discontinuation approach. At a median follow up time of 11 months, the rate of uMRD in peripheral blood and bone marrow was 84% and 73%, respectively, and 62% of patients were able to stop therapy. The most common TEAEs were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infusion reactions, bruising, and diarrhea (51%, 46%, 41%, 41%, 41%). There was one death of a patient experiencing an intracerebral hemorrhage on cycle 1 after receiving intravenous heparin for pulmonary emboli.
Marginal Zone Lymphoma - MAGNOLIA
Zanubrutinib is also being investigated for use in marginal zone lymphoma, a rare and heterogeneous disease in which it has been difficult to define optimal therapeutic strategies. This Phase 2 single arm study (NCT03846427) enrolled 68 patients who received zanubrutinib monotherapy (160mg BID) after having received at least one prior line of anti-CD20-directed therapy. The overall response rate seen with a median follow up of 11 months was 74%, including 24% complete response based on investigator assessment. The nine-month PFS rate was 67%. In the study 96% of patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event ("TEAE") and 38% experienced a TEAE of grade 3 or higher. TEAEs of interest in at least 10% of patients included: infection, hemorrhage, diarrhea, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (40%, 32%, 21%, 13%, 10%). 
Other Lymphomas
We are also investigating zanubrutinib for the treatment of patients with other lymphomas. We have studies ongoing in MCL, FL, and DLBCL.
Analysis of Safety Data from Monotherapy Trials
Pooled safety data from 682 patients enrolled in six Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of zanubrutinib as a monotherapy for WM, MCL, CLL/SLL, DLBCL and other B-cell malignancies were presented at the 2019 European Hematology Association ("EHA"). The majority of patients had R/R disease; almost all patients received zanubrutinib at a dose of 320mg QD or 160mg 
BID. The median duration of zanubrutinib exposure was 13.4 months (0.1-49.7). This analysis included an evaluation of the frequency and severity of AEs, AEs of special interest ("AESIs"), and AEs leading to death, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation. Ninety-seven percent of patients reported at least one AE, which were primarily grade 1 or 2. The most common AEs of all grades included upper respiratory tract infection (32.4%), neutrophil count decreased (25.2%), diarrhea (19.4%), cough (19.1%), contusion (18.6%), and rash (18%). The most common grade ≥3 AEs included neutrophil count decreased (14.4%), anemia (7.6%), neutropenia (6.6%), pneumonia (4.5%), platelet count decreased (4.3%), and lung infection (4.1%). Serious AEs ("SAEs"), consisting primarily of infectious complications such as pneumonia/lung infection, were reported in 36% of patients. AESIs such as atrial fibrillation/flutter (1.9%), major hemorrhage (2.5%), and grade ≥3 hypertension (3.4%) were infrequent, and treatment discontinuation due to AEs was uncommon (9.1% overall, including 3.5% for whom the event(s) were treatment-related).
Tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 Antibody
Tislelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 that is currently being evaluated in pivotal clinical trials globally and in China and for which we plan to commence additional pivotal trials as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care to treat various solid and hematological cancers.
Mechanism of Action
Cells called cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ("CTLs") provide an important self-defense mechanism against cancer, patrolling the body, recognizing cancer cells due to immunogenic features that differ from normal cells, and killing cancer cells by injecting deleterious proteins into them. T-lymphocytes have various mechanisms that prevent them from damaging normal cells, among which is a protein called PD-1 receptor, that is expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes. PD-L1 is an important signaling protein that can engage PD-1. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 sends an inhibitory signal inside the T-lymphocyte and suppresses its cytotoxic effects. Many types of cancer cells have hijacked the PD-L1 expression system that normally exists in healthy cells. By expressing PD-L1, cancer cells protect themselves from being killed by CTLs. Anti-PD-1 therapies are designed to bind to and block downstream activity of PD-1, allowing the immune system to combat cancer cells.
Tislelizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to PD-1, thereby blocking engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Tislelizumab has demonstrated high affinity and specificity for PD-1 in preclinical studies. It is differentiated mechanistically from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies by an engineered Fc region designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages, thereby abrogating antibody-dependent phagocytosis, a potential mechanism of T-cell clearance, which we believe may minimize potentially negative interactions with other immune cells based on preclinical data.
Clinical Development Program, Regulatory Status and Collaboration
Tislelizumab has received conditional approval in China for the treatment of: (i) cHL patients who have received at least two prior therapies (December 2019); and (ii) 2L+ UC PD-L1 positive patients (April 2020). Tislelizumab has also received full approval in China for the treatment of 1L squamous NSCLC patients in combination with chemotherapy (January 2021). It is currently under review by the NMPA for use in front line non-squamous NSCLC and second or third line HCC. 
In January 2021, we announced a collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) to develop and commercialize tislelizumab in North America, Japan, the EU, and six other European countries. We and Novartis have agreed to jointly develop tislelizumab in these licensed countries, with Novartis responsible for regulatory submissions after a transition period and for commercialization upon regulatory approvals. In addition, both companies may conduct clinical trials globally to explore combinations of tislelizumab with other cancer treatments, and we have an option to co-detail the product in North America, funded in part by Novartis. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. 
We have a broad development program for tislelizumab, including 16 filed, approved or registration-enabling clinical trials. These include global pivotal trials in Asia-prevalent cancers, NSCLC, HCC, GC, and ESCC, which are intended to support regulatory submissions globally and in China. 
Our trials in lung cancer include: 
•A global Phase 3 trial evaluating tislelizumab as a second- or third-line treatment compared to docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (NCT03358875); 
•Two Phase 3 trials in China evaluating tislelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in squamous and non-squamous NSCLC (NCT03594747 and NCT03663205, respectively); and 
•A Phase 3 trial in China in 1L SCLC evaluating tislelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (NCT04005716). 
Our trials in liver cancer include: 
•A global Phase 3 trial comparing tislelizumab with sorafenib as first-line treatment for patients with HCC (NCT03412773); and
•A global single-arm pivotal Phase 2 trial evaluating tislelizumab in second or third line unresectable HCC (NCT03419897).
Our trials in gastric cancer include: 
•A global Phase 3 trial of tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy versus placebo combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with gastric cancer (NCT03777657).
Finally, our trials in ESCC include: 
•A global Phase 3 trial comparing tislelizumab with chemotherapy as second-line treatment for patients with advanced ESCC (NCT03430843);
•A global Phase 3 trial of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with ESCC (NCT03783442); and
•A Phase 3 trial in China of tislelizumab versus placebo in combination with chemoradiotherapy in patients with localized ESCC (NCT03957590).
We are also evaluating tislelizumab in registration-enabling trials in UC, MSI-high or dMMR solid tumors, and NPC. We have two China studies in UC, including a pivotal Phase 2 (NCT04004221) in second-line UC evaluating tislelizumab as monotherapy that was the basis for our UC approval in China in May 2020, and a Phase 3 trial (NCT03967977) in first line UC comparing tislelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. In MSI-high or dMMR solid tumors we have an ongoing pivotal Phase 2 trial (NCT03736889) in China examining tislelizumab as monotherapy, and in NPC we have a Phase 3 trial (NCT03924986) in China in first line evaluating tislelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. 
We have announced that four of Phase 3 trials for tislelizumab have met their respective primary endpoints, in 1L squamous NSCLC, 1L non-squamous NSCLC, 2L NSCLC, and 2L ESCC. In 1L NSCLC, tislezumab in combination with chemotherapy has shown improved PFS when compared to PFS in both squamous and non-squamous patients.  In 2L NSCLC and 2L ESCC, tislelizumab has shown improved overall survival compared to chemotherapy. 
We expect several milestones from the tislelizumab program in 2021. Finalizing the transaction with Novartis is expected in the first quarter of 2021. Submission of the first BLA outside of China is expected during the year. Submission of sBLAs in China for 2L/3L NSCLC and MSI-H/dMMR solid tumors is expected in the first half of 2021, and for 2L ESCC in mid-2021. Regulatory decision on sBLAs in 1L non-squamous NSCLC and 2L/3L HCC are expected in China in 2021. We expect to announce topline results of the Phase 3 trial of 1L treatment combined with chemotherapy in patients with NPC in 2021. Completion of enrollment of the Phase 3 trial in 1L SCLC is expected in the first half of 2021. Completion of enrollment in the Phase 3 trial versus placebo in combination with chemoradiotherapy in patients with localized ESCC is expected in 2021.
Summary of Clinical Results
As of January 2021, we had enrolled over 7,700 patients in clinical trials of tislelizumab, including combination trials. Data from our trials thus far suggested that tislelizumab was generally well-tolerated and exhibited anti-tumor activity in a variety of tumor types. All of the studies discussed below were presented at major medical conferences and were included in press releases issued at the time of the medical conferences and included in our current reports or announcements filed with the SEC and HKEx, respectively. Those sources have further details on each study. 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
In January 2020, we announced that our Phase 3 clinical study evaluating tislelizumab plus two chemotherapy regimens versus chemotherapy alone in first-line treatment of squamous NSCLC patients (NCT03594747) met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival at the planned interim analysis, as determined by independent review committee. In this study, patients with previously untreated advanced squamous NSCLC were randomized to receive either tislelizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, tislelizumab in combination with nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel (ABRAXANE®) 
and carboplatin, or paclitaxel and carboplatin alone. Based on the pre-planned interim analysis, both tislelizumab treatment arms crossed the pre-specified efficacy boundary compared to chemotherapy alone. 
The data from this trial were presented at the 2020 annual meeting of ASCO and are briefly summarized below. 

 | Arm A | Arm B | Arm C

In April 2020, we announced that our Phase 3 clinical study evaluating tislelizumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in first-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC patients (NCT03663205) met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival at the planned interim analysis, as determined by independent review committee. In this study, patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC were randomized to receive either tislelizumab in combination with pemetrexed and investigator’s choice of platinum chemotherapy (either carboplatin or cisplatin) versus pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy alone. Based on the pre-planned interim analysis, the tislelizumab treatment arm crossed the pre-specified efficacy boundary compared to chemotherapy alone. 
The data from this trial were presented at the 2020 virtual congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology ("ESMO") and are briefly summarized below.

Two reports of preliminary efficacy and safety from a clinical trial (NCT03493451) investigating use of tislelizumab in lymphoma were reported at the 2020 virtual congress of EHA. The two reports were each from one arm of the study, one in natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and one in peripheral T-cell lymphoma. 
Safety Results
The safety results of tislelizumab in clinical trials to date have been consistent with its therapeutic class, having a relatively low rate of drug-related grade 3 or above toxicity. The safety data of tislelizumab described below was obtained from 934 patients treated with tislelizumab monotherapy from the following four clinical studies as of April 2020: BGB-A317-001 (N=451), BGB-A317-102 (N=300), BGB-A317-203 (N=70) and BGB-A317-204 (N=113). Types of tumors studied included: urothelial carcinoma (N=152), non-small cell lung cancer (N=105), esophageal carcinoma (N=81), gastric cancer (N=78), classical Hodgkin lymphoma (N=70), hepatocellular carcinoma (N=69), colorectal cancer (N=54), ovarian cancer (N=51) , renal cell carcinoma (N=37), melanoma (N=36), breast cancer (N=32), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (N=29), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (N=27), cholangiocarcinoma (N=18), pancreatic cancer (N=10), small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (N=10), sarcoma (N=10), mesothelioma (N=9), cervical cancer (N=7), and others (N=49). In the above studies, 496 patients received tislelizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks, 355 patients received tislelizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, 26 patients received 2 mg/kg once every 2 weeks, 26 patients received 5 mg/kg once every 2 weeks, 21 patients received 2 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, 7 patients received 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks, and 3 patients received 0.5 mg/kg once every 2 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 16 weeks (range: 0.6 - 160.4 weeks); 36.1% patients received treatment with tislelizumab for ≥ 6 months and 20.6% for ≥ 12 months.
The incidence of adverse reactions of all grades was 70.8% in 934 patients treated with tislelizumab. Those occurring in ≥10% of patients included rash, fatigue, and alanine aminotransferase increased.
The incidence of Grade 3 or higher AEs was 21.8%. Those occurring in ≥1% of patients included: gamma‑glutamyl transferase increased, anemia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, pneumonitis, severe skin reactions, and hypokalemia.
 irTEAEs and Deaths
The specific irAE rates listed below are from the four studies of tislelizumab in 934 patients summarized above. These irAEs have well-established algorithms for treatment and are considered manageable. irAEs seen in >1.0% of patients were as follows:

 | All Grades, n | Grade ≥ 3, n 
Immune-related pneumonitis | 25 | 14 
Immune-related diarrhea and colitis | 10 (3 diarrhea, 7 colitis) | 6 (2 diarrhea, 4 colitis)
Immune-related hepatitis | 20 | 13 
Immune-related hypothyroidism | 70 | 0 
Immune-related hyperthyroidism | 35 | 0 
Immune-related thyroiditis | 9 | 0 
Immune-related skin adverse reactions | 67 | 10 

In total, there were four deaths in the pooled data set of 934 patients across the four studies. The four deaths occurred in one patient experiencing immune-related pneumonitis, two patients experiencing immune-related hepatitis, and one patient experiencing immune-related nephritis (all-grade immune-related nephritis incidence was 0.6%).
Pamiparib, a PARP1 and PARP2 Inhibitor
Pamiparib is an investigational, selective small molecule inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 ("PARP1") and PARP2 enzymes that is being evaluated as a potential monotherapy and in combinations for the treatment of various solid tumors. We believe that pamiparib has the potential to be differentiated from other PARP inhibitors because of its brain penetration, greater selectivity, strong DNA-trapping activity, and good oral bioavailability demonstrated in preclinical models.
Mechanism of Action
PARP family members PARP1 and PARP2 play essential roles in cell survival in response to DNA damage. Inhibition of PARPs prevents the repair of common single-strand DNA breaks, which leads to formation of double-strand breaks during DNA replication. Cancer cells with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene, or BRCA1/2 genes, are highly sensitive to PARP inhibition. This phenomenon is called “synthetic lethality” and is the foundation of the therapeutic utility of PARP 
inhibitors as a monotherapy for BRCA mutant cancers. In addition to hereditary BRCA1/2 mutations, the synthetic lethality concept has been broadened to include sporadic tumors that display homologous recombination deficiency ("HRD", a double stranded DNA repair mechanism), a gene expression profile that resembles that of a BRCA deficient tumor. 
Another potential therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors is in combination therapy. PARP inhibitors are hypothesized to potentiate cytotoxicity of DNA-alkylating agents such as platinum compounds, temozolomide and ionizing radiation, and may be used in combination with these agents in treating various cancers. 
Summary of Clinical Results
We presented preliminary results from a Phase 2 registration trial at ESMO 2020. The data are from a Phase 2 dose-expansion portion of a Phase 1/2 trial of pamiparib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, fallopian cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer or advanced triple negative breast cancer (NCT03333915). A total of 113 patients in China with high-grade, non-mucinous, epithelial OC (including fallopian or primary peritoneal cancer), harboring germline BRCA1/2 mutation, following at least two prior lines of standard chemotherapy were enrolled in the pivotal Phase 2 portion of the trial, including 90 patients with advanced platinum-sensitive OC (PSOC) in Cohort 1, and 23 patients with advanced platinum-resistant OC (PROC) in Cohort 2. 
As of the data cutoff on February 2, 2020, there was a median follow-up time of 12.2 months. In Cohort 1, the patients with PSOC, the ORR was 65%. In Cohort 2, the patients with PROC, the ORR was 32%. Pamiparib was generally tolerated in patients with PSOC and PROC, which is similar to other PARP inhibitors. Across the trial, the most common (≥20%) TEAEs of any grade included anemia (89%), nausea (68%), decreased neutrophil count (61%), decreased white blood cell count (60%), vomiting (50%), decreased platelet count (31%), decreased appetite (30%), asthenia (28%), diarrhea (22%), increased AST (21%), decreased lymphocyte count (21%), increased ALT (20%), and leukopenia (20%).
Clinical Development Program and Regulatory Status
In July 2020, we filed an NDA for pamiparib in China for use in third-line BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer based on the pivotal study results described above. In addition to this study, our clinical development program includes a Phase 3 trial as a maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent OC (NCT03519230), a Phase 2 trial in BRCA-mutated HER2-negative breast cancer (NCT03575065), a Phase 2 trial in first-line platinum-sensitive GC maintenance (NCT03427814), and a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with temozolomide in glioblastoma multiforme (NCT03150862). 
We expect to announce top-line results from the Phase 3 maintenance study in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent OC in 2021 or the first half of 2022.
Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217), an TIGIT Inhibitor
Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217) is an investigational humanized IgG1-variant monoclonal antibody directed against TIGIT. We have an ongoing Phase 1a/1b trial (NCT04047862) in Australia investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BGB-A1217 in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The molecule has exhibited high potency in our experiments, and possesses a competent Fc moiety which our experiments suggest is required for optimal efficacy. Further, no DLTs have been observed and full target occupancy has been seen in PBMCs at the lowest dose tested. We have selected the randomized Phase 2 dose for ociperlimab and are studying the molecule in combination with tislelizumab. We plan to present Phase 1a/1b data in 2021, and a registrational program is expected to begin in the first half of 2021. 
Lifirafenib (BGB-283) and BGB-3245, Inhibitors of RAF
Lifirafenib is an investigational novel small molecule inhibitor with RAF monomer and dimer inhibition activities. Lifirafenib has shown antitumor activities in preclinical models and in cancer patients with tumors harboring BRAF V600E mutations, non-V600E BRAF mutations or KRAS/NRAS mutations. We have been developing lifirafenib for the treatment of cancers with aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase ("MAPK"), pathway, including BRAF gene mutations and KRAS/NRAS gene mutations where first generation BRAF inhibitors are not effective. We believe that lifirafenib as monotherapy or in combination with other agents may have potential for treating various malignancies such as melanoma, NSCLC, and endometrial cancer.
Currently approved BRAF inhibitors include Roche’s ZELBORAF® (vemurafenib), Novartis’ TAFINLAR® (dabrafenib) and Pfizer / Array BioPharma's BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib). The combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is approved in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma, such as Novartis’ dabrafenib and MEKINIST® (trametinib), Roche’s vemurafenib and COTELLIC® (cobimetinib), and Pfizer / Array Biopharma’s BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib) 
and MEKTOVI® (binimetinib). We are aware of several other BRAF inhibitors in clinical development, such as Roche’s belvarafenib and Novartis’ LXH254.
BeiGene is working together with SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. ("SpringWorks") in a global clinical collaboration and has initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial (NCT03905148) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of lifirafenib in combination with SpringWorks' investigational MEK inhibitor, mirdametinib (PD-0325901), in patients with advanced solid tumors. 
In addition to the collaboration, BeiGene and SpringWorks formed a separate company, MapKure, LLC, to develop BGB-3245, an investigational, selective next-generation RAF kinase inhibitor discovered by BeiGene scientists. MapKure has an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of BGB-3245 (NCT04249843) in patients with advanced or refractory tumors harboring specific v-RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B ("B-RAF") genetic mutations.
Sitravatinib (MGCD-0516), a Multi-Kinase Inhibitor
In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. ("Mirati") for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of Mirati’s sitravatinib in Asia (excluding Japan and certain other countries), Australia and New Zealand. Sitravatinib is an investigational spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor, which potently inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases, including RET, TAM family receptors (TYRO3, Axl, MER), and split family receptors (VEGFR2, KIT). Sitravatinib is being evaluated by Mirati in multiple clinical trials to treat patients who are refractory to prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, including a Phase 3 trial of sitravatinib in NSCLC initiated in 2019. Sitravatinib is also being evaluated as a single agent in patients with NSCLC, melanoma and other solid tumor types whose tumors harbor specific genetic alterations in the CBL protein. In recent data readouts by Mirati, sitravatinib has demonstrated durable responses in lung cancer patients who progressed after treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. We have an ongoing Phase 1 trial (NCT03666143) of sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab in various solid tumors in Australia and China, and a Phase 1/2 trial (NCT03941873) is investigating sitravatinib monotherapy and combining sitravatinib with tislelizumab focused on HCC or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
BGB-11417, a Small Molecule Bcl-2 Inhibitor
BGB-11417 is an investigational small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor. We have completed preclinical and investigational new drug ("IND") -enabling studies of BGB-11417, which demonstrated potent activity and high selectivity against the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The molecule appears to be more potent than venetoclax and shows the potential to overcome resistance to venetoclax. Further, it is more selective than venetoclax for Bcl-2 relative to Bcl-xL. Finally, we believe that it is well-positioned to be combined with BRUKINSA®. We have an ongoing Phase 1 trial (NCT04277637) in Australia and the United States to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BGB-11417 and its combination with zanubrutinib in patients with mature B-cell malignancies.
BGB-A445, an OX40 Agonist Antibody
BGB-A445 is an investigational agonistic antibody directed to the OX40 antigen. BGB-A445 is a non-ligand competing antibody that does not disrupt OX40 to OX40 ligand engagement. Preclinical experiments showed that our antibody has increasing effectiveness at higher doses versus an antibody that was ligand-competing, which showed falling effectiveness at higher doses. BGB-A445 has also showed in preclinical tests the potential to be combined with several agents, such as tislelizumab, as well as a TLR9 agonist, a PI3Kδ inhibitor, sitravatinib, and chemotherapy. We have an ongoing Phase 1 trial (NCT04215978) of our OX40 antibody in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Zanidatamab (ZW25), a bispecific HER2 inhibitor
Zanidatamab (ZW25), a novel investigational Azymetric™ bispecific antibody against HER2, is currently in late-stage clinical development with Zymeworks Inc. BeiGene has development and commercial rights to zanidatamab in Asia (excluding Japan), Australia, and New Zealand. We have two clinical studies ongoing with zanidatamab. The first is a phase 1/2 study (NCT04215978) in HER2 positive breast and gastric cancer. The breast cancer arm combines zanidatmab with docetaxel, and the gastric arm combines zanidatamab with our PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab and chemotherapy. The second study (NCT04466891) is a Phase 2b study in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-amplified biliary tract cancers (BTC) in which zanidatamab is being used as monotherapy. We expect to initiate a Phase 3 study examining zanidatamab in combination with chemotherapy with and without tislelizumab in HER2 positive gastroesophageal cancer in 2021.
BGB-A333, a PD-L1 Inhibitor
BGB-A333 is an investigational humanized IgG1-variant monoclonal antibody against PD-L1, the ligand of PD-1. We have investigated BGB-A333 as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies, such as tislelizumab, to treat 
various cancers. We recently completed a Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03379259) in Australia to assess the safety and antitumor effect of BGB-A333 alone and in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
BGB-A425, a TIM-3 Inhibitor
BGB-A425 is an investigational humanized IgG1-variant monoclonal antibody against T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 ("TIM-3"). We have an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial (NCT03744468) of BGB-A425 in combination with tislelizumab in various solid tumors.
BGB-15025, a Small Molecule HPK1 Inhibitor
BGB-15025 is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of HPK1, which is a key negative feedback regulator of TCR signaling. Inhibition of HPK1 leads to enhanced T-cell activation pre-clinically. In addition, preclinical studies showed that BGB-15025 exhibits combination activity with tislelizumab and has a wide therapeutic window. We plan to initiate clinical studies in the first quarter of 2021.
Our Preclinical Programs
We have a proprietary biology research platform that has allowed us to research and develop both small molecules and biologic molecules. In the last decade, this platform has generated more than 10 clinical stage assets, including two internally-developed molecules that have been approved by regulatory bodies in the United States and China and in China, respectively, with other filings pending globally and planned to be submitted. The platform is a full-process technology system spanning from early discovery to commercialization of oncology medicines based on multiple drug technology platforms that can be applied to oncology and other fields. We have core technology platforms for the development of small molecule and antibody medicines and the manufacturing of our own and potentially other medicines. 
We anticipate advancing multiple our preclinical drug candidates into the clinic in the next 12 months. We believe that we have the opportunity to combine tislelizumab with our preclinical candidates to target multiple points in the cancer immunity cycle. We also may seek to develop companion diagnostics that will help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from the use of our medicines and drug candidates.
Manufacturing and Supply
We manufacture our medicines and drug candidates internally and with the help of third-party contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs"). The manufacturing of our medicines and drug candidates is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements governing recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control, and quality assurance, among others. Our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of the CMOs we use to manufacture our medicines and drug candidates operate under current good manufacturing practice regulations ("GMP") conditions. GMP regulations are requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.
Our Manufacturing Facilities
We have manufacturing facilities for small molecule drugs and large molecule biologics in Suzhou and Guangzhou, China, respectively, to support the commercialization and potential future demand of our internally developed products. 
Our manufacturing facility in Suzhou is over 13,000 square meters and consists of a manufacturing base for small molecule drug products with an annual production capacity of about 100 million tablets and a pilot test biologics production facility with 500 liters capacity. In addition, our Suzhou facility produces biologics candidates for clinical supply. It is aligned with the design criteria of the United States, EU, and China regulatory requirements. The facility has a manufacturing license, which is required for the commercial manufacture of zanubrutinib in China.
We are also building a state-of-the-art commercial-scale manufacturing facility of approximately 100,000 square meters in Guangzhou for the manufacturing of large molecule biologics. Phase I and Phase II of the facility have been completed in September 2019 and December 2020, respectively, with biologics capacity of 24,000 liters, and Phase III is expected to be completed by the end of 2021 with capacity of 40,000 liters. Upon completion, the total capacity will reach 64,000 liters. In the future, we intend to expand the production capacity of the Guangzhou facility to exceed 120,000 liters and to reach up to 200,000 liters. We have received a manufacturing license for drug substances and drug products for this facility and approval to manufacture commercial product is expected in the first half of 2021. Following regulatory inspection and approval, the first commercial product to be manufactured at this facility is expected to be tislelizumab.
We are also looking to expand our biologics manufacturing capabilities to include a future manufacturing facility in the United States, with multiple sites currently under review. 
We also have pilot scale (approximately 140 square meter) manufacturing capabilities at our research facility in Beijing, China, which produces preclinical and clinical trial materials for some of our small molecule drug candidates.
Contract Manufacturing Organizations
We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a limited number of third-party CMOs and CROs for the production of some drug products and drug substances and the supply of raw materials to meet the commercial, clinical, and preclinical needs of our medicines and drug candidates. We have adopted procedures to ensure that the production qualifications, facilities, and processes of the third-party suppliers engaged by us comply with relevant regulatory requirements and our internal quality and operational guidelines. We select our third-party suppliers carefully by considering a number of factors, including their qualifications, relevant expertise, production capacity, geographic proximity, reputation, track record, product quality, reliability in meeting delivery schedules, and business terms.
We have commercial supply and related agreements with most of our manufacturing service providers. For example, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC ("Catalent") to produce BRUKINSA® at Catalent’s Kansas City, MO site for clinical and commercial use in the United States and other countries outside of China. We currently source the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for BRUKINSA® from a supplier in China and are in the process of bringing an additional source of supply online outside of China. In addition, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals (China) Ltd. ("Boehringer Ingelheim") for tislelizumab, which is being manufactured at Boehringer Ingelheim’s facility in Shanghai, China as part of a marketing authorization holder ("MAH") project pioneered by us and Boehringer Ingelheim. Additionally, our collaboration and license agreement with Novartis includes the right for Novartis to manufacture tislelizumab for the licensed territory, to be managed by Novartis following tech transfer. For our commercial and clinical stage products licensed from Amgen and BMS, we rely on Amgen and BMS and their manufacturing facilities or CMOs outside of China for the supply of those medicines and drug candidates.
Our agreements with the outsourced suppliers engaged by us generally set out terms, including product quality or service details, technical standards or methods, delivery terms, agreed price and payment, and product inspection and acceptance criteria. We are generally allowed to return any products that fail to meet specified quality standards. Our outsourced suppliers procure raw materials themselves. Typically, outsourced suppliers request settlement of payment within 30 days from the date of invoice. Either party may terminate the agreements by serving notice to the other party under certain circumstances.
We generally obtain raw materials for our manufacturing activities from various suppliers who we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. Raw materials and starting materials used at our facilities in Beijing and Suzhou include active pharmaceutical ingredients custom-made by our third-party CROs and excipients, which are commercially available from well-known vendors that meet the requirements of the relevant regulatory agencies. The core raw materials used in manufacturing at our Guangzhou facility are genetically modified cell lines that we have co-developed and licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim and other third parties.
We typically order raw materials on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term, dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. We pay for our purchases of raw materials on credit. Credit periods granted to us by our suppliers generally range from 30 to 60 days. Our suppliers are generally not responsible for any defects in our finished products.
Amgen Collaboration
Collaboration Agreement
On October 31, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BeiGene Switzerland GmbH (“BeiGene Switzerland”), entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Amgen, which became effective on January 2, 2020 (the "Amgen Collaboration Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Amgen Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for commercializing Amgen’s oncology products XGEVA®, BLINCYTO® and KYPROLIS® in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) for a period of five or seven years following each product’s regulatory approval in China, as specified in the Amgen Collaboration Agreement, with the commercialization period for XGEVA® commencing following the transition of operational responsibilities for the product. In addition, as specified in the agreement, we have the option to retain one of the three products to commercialize for as long as the product is sold in China. The parties have agreed to equally share profits and losses for the products in China during each product’s commercialization period. After expiration of the commercialization period for each product, the products not retained will be transitioned back to Amgen and we will be eligible to receive tiered mid-single to low-double digit royalties on net sales in China of each product for an additional five years.
Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Amgen Collaboration Agreement, we and Amgen have agreed to collaborate on the global development and commercialization of a portfolio of Amgen clinical- and late-preclinical-stage oncology pipeline products. Starting from the commencement of the Amgen Collaboration Agreement, we and Amgen will co-fund global 
development costs, with BeiGene contributing up to $1.25 billion worth of development services and cash over the term of the collaboration. We will be eligible to receive tiered mid-single digit royalties on net sales of each product globally outside of China, other than sotorasib (AMG 510), on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of the expiration of the last valid patent claim, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, or the earlier of eight years after the first commercial sale of such product in the country of sale and 20 years from the date of first commercial sale of such product anywhere in the world.
For each pipeline product that is approved in China, we will have the right to commercialize the product for seven years, with the parties sharing profits and losses for the product in China equally. In addition, we will have the right to retain approximately one of every three approved products, up to a total of six, other than sotorasib (AMG 510), to commercialize for as long as each such product is sold in China. After the expiration of the seven-year commercialization period, each product will be transitioned back to Amgen and we will be eligible to received tiered mid-single to low-double digit royalties on net sales in China for an additional five years. The parties are subject to specified exclusivity requirements in China and the rest of the world.
BeiGene, Ltd. has guaranteed certain obligations of BeiGene Switzerland under the Amgen Collaboration Agreement pursuant to the terms of a separate Guarantee Agreement.
The Amgen Collaboration Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties. The agreement will continue in effect on a product-by-product basis unless terminated by either party pursuant to its terms. The agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties, or by either party upon the other party’s uncured material breach, insolvency, failure to comply with specified compliance provisions, or subject to a specified negotiation mechanism, certain adverse economic impacts or the failure to meet commercial objectives. In addition, Amgen may terminate the agreement with respect to a pipeline product in the event it suspends development of such pipeline product on specified terms, subject to the parties determining whether to continue development of the pipeline product in China.
Share Purchase Agreement
In connection with the Amgen Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated October 31, 2019, as amended, by and between BeiGene, Ltd. and Amgen (the “Share Purchase Agreement”), we issued to Amgen 206,635,013 ordinary shares in the form of 15,895,001 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) of BeiGene, Ltd. on January 2, 2020, representing approximately 20.5% of our then outstanding shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.78 billion, or $13.45 per ordinary share, or $174.85 per ADS.
Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, Amgen has agreed to (i) a lock-up on sales of its shares until the earliest of (a) the fourth anniversary of the closing, (b) the expiration or termination of the Collaboration Agreement and (c) a change of control of BeiGene, Ltd., (ii) a standstill until the later of (a) the first anniversary of the date as of which it ceases to have the right to appoint a director and (b) the date on which it holds less than 5% of our then outstanding shares, and (iii) a voting agreement to vote its shares on certain matters presented for shareholder approval until the later of (a) the fifth anniversary of the closing and (b) the expiration of the standstill period, all under specified circumstances and as set forth in the agreement. Following the later of (i) the expiration of the lock-up period and (ii) the expiration of the standstill period, Amgen has agreed not to sell shares representing more than 5% of our then outstanding shares in any rolling 12-month period, subject to specified exceptions. In addition, Amgen will have the right to designate an independent director to serve on our board of directors until the earlier of (a) the date on which Amgen holds less than 10% of our then outstanding shares as a result of Amgen’s sale of ordinary shares or Amgen’s failure to participate in future offerings and (b) the third anniversary of the date of the expiration or termination of the Amgen Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, Amgen will also have specified registration rights upon expiration of the lock-up. Additionally, we have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to provide Amgen with an opportunity to participate in subsequent new securities offerings upon the same terms and conditions as other purchasers in the offering in an amount needed to allow Amgen to hold up to 20.6% of our shares, subject to applicable law and HKEx rules and other specified conditions.
On March 17, 2020, BeiGene, Ltd. and Amgen entered into an Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the Share Purchase Agreement in order to account for periodic dilution from the issuance of shares by us, which agreement was restated in its entirety on September 24, 2020 (the “Restated Second Amendment”). Pursuant to the Restated Second Amendment, Amgen has an option (the “Direct Purchase Option”) to subscribe for additional ADSs in an amount necessary to enable it to increase (and subsequently maintain) its ownership at approximately 20.6% of our outstanding shares. The Direct Purchase Option is exercisable on a monthly basis, but only if Amgen’s interest in our outstanding shares at the monthly reference date is less than 20.4%. The Direct Purchase Option (i) is exercisable by Amgen solely as a result of dilution arising from issuance of new shares by us under our equity incentive plans from time to time, and (ii) is subject to annual approval by our independent shareholders each year during the term of the Restated Second Amendment. The exercise period of the Direct Purchase Option 
commenced on December 1, 2020 and will terminate on the earliest of: (a) the date on which Amgen and its affiliates collectively own less than 20% of the outstanding share capital of the Company as a result of Amgen’s sale of shares; (b) at least 60-day advance written notice from either Amgen or the Company that such party wishes to terminate the Direct Purchase Option; or (c) December 1, 2023. The Direct Purchase Option has no vesting period.
Novartis Collaboration
On January 11, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BeiGene Switzerland GmbH, entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Novartis Collaboration and License Agreement”) with Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”), pursuant to which Novartis will have the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tislelizumab in the United States, Canada, Mexico, member countries of the European Union, United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Russia, and Japan (the “Licensed Territory”).
Under the Novartis Collaboration and License Agreement, we will receive an upfront cash payment of $650 million from Novartis. Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to $1.3 billion upon the achievement of regulatory milestones, $250 million upon the achievement of sales milestones, and tiered royalties based on percentages of annual net sales of tislelizumab in the Licensed Territory ranging from the high-teens to high-twenties, with customary reductions in specified circumstances. Royalties are payable on a country-by-country basis from the time of the first commercial sale until the latest of the expiration of the last valid patent claim, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of tislelizumab in the country of sale.
Under the Novartis Collaboration and License Agreement, we and Novartis have agreed to jointly develop tislelizumab in the Licensed Territory, with Novartis responsible for regulatory submissions after a transition period and for commercialization upon regulatory approvals. In addition, both companies may conduct clinical trials to explore potential combinations of tislelizumab with other cancer treatments. We will be responsible for funding the ongoing clinical trials of tislelizumab, and Novartis has agreed to fund any new registrational, bridging, or post-marketing studies in the Licensed Territory. Subject to specified conditions, both parties have agreed to jointly fund other new clinical trials in the Licensed Territory agreed by the parties, provided that each party will be responsible for funding clinical trials evaluating tislelizumab in combination with its own- or third-party cancer treatments. We will initially be responsible for supplying tislelizumab to Novartis, with Novartis having the right to conduct manufacturing for its use in the Licensed Territory after successful transfer of the manufacturing process. In addition, we have an option to co-detail the product in the United States, Canada and Mexico, on an indication-by-indication basis, funded in part by Novartis. Each party retains the worldwide right to commercialize its propriety products in combination with tislelizumab.
The Novartis Collaboration and License Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon expiration of the royalty term in such country and in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms in all countries in the Licensed Territory. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon written notice (i) if Novartis challenges the licensed BeiGene patents, or (ii) if Novartis files a biologics license application for its anti-PD-1 antibody, spartalizumab, in the Licensed Territory, and we do not elect to include spartalizumab as a licensed product under the agreement or Novartis does not divest the product candidate, in which case Novartis would pay us a specified termination fee. The agreement may be terminated by Novartis upon 120 days’ prior written notice if delivered before first commercial sale or 180 days’ prior written notice if delivered following first commercial sale of tislelizumab in the Licensed Territory, or by either party upon the other party’s bankruptcy or uncured material breach.
The transaction contemplated under the Collaboration and License Agreement is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
Celgene License and Supply Agreement
On July 5, 2017, we and Celgene Logistics Sàrl, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMS, entered into a License and Supply Agreement, which we refer to as the China License Agreement and which became effective on August 31, 2017, pursuant to which we were granted the right to exclusively distribute and promote BMS’s approved cancer therapies, REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® and ABRAXANE® in China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In addition, if Celgene decides to commercialize a new oncology product through a third party in the licensed territory during the first five years of the term, we have a right of first negotiation to obtain the right to commercialize the product, subject to certain conditions. We subsequently assigned the agreement to our wholly-owned subsidiary, BeiGene Switzerland.
The term of the China License Agreement is 10 years and may be terminated by either party upon written notice in the event of uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party, or if the underlying regulatory approvals for the covered 
products are revoked. BMS also has the right to terminate the agreement with respect to REVLIMID® at any time upon written notice to us under certain circumstances.
The China License Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and confidentiality and mutual indemnification provisions.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our medicines, drug candidates, and their methods of use are an important part of our strategy to develop and commercialize novel medicines, as described in more detail below. We have filed patent applications and obtained patents in the United States and other countries and regions, such as China and Europe, relating to our medicines and certain of our drug candidates, and are pursuing additional patent protection for them and for our other drug candidates and technologies. We rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including our manufacturing processes. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and support our development programs.
As of January 31, 2021, we owned 30 issued U.S. patents, 14 issued China patents, a number of pending U.S. and China patent applications, and corresponding patents and patent applications internationally. In addition, we owned pending international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT"), which we plan to file nationally in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as additional priority PCT applications. With respect to any issued patents in the United States and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain a patent term extension to extend the patent expiration date, provided that we meet the applicable requirements for obtaining such patent term extensions. For example, in the United States, we can apply for a patent term extension of up to five years for one of the patents covering a drug product once the product is approved by the FDA. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time that we spend in clinical studies as well as getting approval from the FDA. In China, the Amended PRC Patent Law, which will become effective on June 1, 2021, provides a patent term extension of up to five years, similar to the United States.
The key patents for our medicines and late-stage clinical drug candidates as of January 31, 2021, are summarized below:

Molecule | Territory | General Subject Matter | Expiration1
BRUKINSA®(Zanubrutinib) | U.S. | Compound and composition | 2034 
U.S. | Use for the treatment of autoimmune diseases | 2034

U.S. | Crystalline forms | 2036 
U.S. | Crystalline forms | 2038 
China | Compound and composition | 2031 
China | Use for the treatment of cancer | 2031 

(1) The expected expiration does not include any additional term for patent term extensions
We have three in-licensed medicines in China from Bristol Myers Squibb company ("BMS"). The key patents for them as of January 31, 2021 are summarized below:

Product | Territory | General Subject Matter | Expiration
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) | China | Use for the treatment of multiple myeloma | 2023 
China | Use for the treatment of multiple myeloma | 2023 
China | Use for the treatment of multiple myeloma | 2023 
China | Use for the treatment of multiple myeloma | 2023 
VIDAZA® (azacitidine) | China | No patent | N/A 
ABRAXANE® (a nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) | China | Use for the treatment of cancer | 2026 
China | Use for the treatment of cancer | 2031 

Under our collaboration with Amgen, we have the right to commercialize in China two medicines and, upon approval in China, one late-stage product candidate. The key patents necessary for these products in China are summarized below:

Product | Territory | General Subject Matter | Expiration
XGEVA® (denosumab) | China | Antibodies | 2022 
BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab) | China | No patent | N/A 
KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) | China | Compound and Composition | 2025 

Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent and the protection it affords, is limited. REVLIMID®, VIDAZA® and ABRAXANE® face competition from generic medications, and we may face similar competition for our medicines and any approved drug candidates even if we successfully obtain patent protection. The scope, validity or enforceability of our or our collaborators' patents may be challenged in court or other authorities, and we or they may not be successful in enforcing or defending those intellectual property rights and, as a result, may not be able to develop or market the relevant product exclusively, which would have a material adverse effect on any potential sales of that product. For example, the China patents for KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) are currently in an invalidation proceeding brought by another company. Additionally, in China, the NMPA may approve a generic version of a brand-name medicine that still has patent protection, such as has occurred with REVLIMID®. Under our license agreements with BMS and Amgen, they retain the responsibility for, but are not obligated, to prosecute, defend and enforce the patents for these in-licensed products. As such, any issued patents may not protect us from generic or biosimilar competition for these medicines.
The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States and China, the term of an issued patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened in some cases by a patent term adjustment, which extends the term of a patent to account for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "USPTO"), in excess of a patent applicant’s own delays during the prosecution process, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent having an earlier expiration date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost in obtaining FDA regulatory approval. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. In China, the Amended PRC Patent Law, which will become effective on June 1, 2021, provides both patent term adjustment and patent term extension, similar to the United States.
In certain foreign jurisdictions similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are also available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country by country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of any patent term extensions or adjustments, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect aspects of our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Additionally, we currently own a number of registered trademarks and pending trademark applications. We currently have registered trademarks for BeiGene, our corporate logo and product names and logos in the United States, China, the EU and 
other jurisdictions, and we are seeking further trademark protection for BeiGene, our corporate logo, product names and logos, and other marks in jurisdictions where available and appropriate.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, China, Europe and other jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of drugs like those we are developing and commercializing. Some jurisdictions also regulate drug pricing. Generally, for a new drug to be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Regulation
U.S. Government Regulation and Product Approval
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA"), and its implementing regulations.
Cancer therapies are sometimes characterized according to line of therapy, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for second or third-line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first line therapy may be adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Whenever first line therapy, usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation, surgery or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second line therapy may be administered. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs, tumor targeted small molecule drugs or a combination of these. Third line therapies can include bone marrow transplantation, antibody and small molecule targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery. In some cases, new technologies and investigational medicines, as part of a clinical trial, may be used as any line of therapy.
U.S. Drug Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and chemistry, manufacture and control (“CMC”) studies according to Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") guidance;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug ("IND") application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, for the intended use;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA for a small molecule drug or a Biologics License Application ("BLA") for a biologic;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP;
•FDA audits of some clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA or licensing of the BLA.
Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials
Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters 
to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or noncompliance and may be imposed on all products within a certain class of products. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations require that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an institutional review board ("IRB") must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be filed with the FDA as an IND amendment and submitted to the IRBs for approval.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA or NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition.
•Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population. These clinical trials are intended to evaluate the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
We refer to our Phase 1 programs as dose-escalation and dose-expansion trials. In addition, we refer to some of our Phase 2 programs as pivotal or registrational programs, where the results can be used to support regulatory approval in specific jurisdictions without the need to conduct a Phase 3 trial.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected AEs, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product drug. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical 
trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Expanded Access 
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. There is no requirement for a company to provide expanded access to its investigational products. However, if a company decides to make one of its investigational products available for expanded access, the FDA reviews each request for expanded access and determines if treatment may proceed. A manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the CMC, analytical tests conducted on the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new small molecule drug or a BLA for a biologic, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug product program fee.
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use, and a BLA to determine whether the biologic is safe, pure, and potent for its intended use. The FDA also evaluates whether the product’s manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
The approval process can be lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA or BLA that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may 
require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also approve an NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") program to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions, and in the United States by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. We are developing combination products using our own drug candidates and third-party drugs.
Regulation of Companion Diagnostics in the United States
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling.
Expedited Programs
Fast Track Designation
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs, including biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product candidate as a fast track product concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of each portion of the NDA or BLA and the applicant pays the applicable user fee. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Zanubrutinib was granted fast track designation by the FDA for the treatment of WM and MZL. Tislelizumab was granted fast track designation by the FDA for the treatment of 1L HCC.
Accelerated Approval
Under FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug, including a biologic, intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that generally provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over available treatments and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement or clinical signs of a disease or condition that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Zanubrutinib was granted accelerated approval by FDA for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy.
Breakthrough Designation
Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A drug or biologic product candidate can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a product candidate be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product candidate’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product candidate’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor. The designation may be rescinded if the product candidate does not continue to meet the criteria for breakthrough therapy designation.
Zanubrutinib was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy.
Priority Review
The FDA may grant an NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
The NDA for zanubrutinib was granted priority review by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, as amended (“PREA”), certain NDAs and BLAs and certain NDA and BLA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted except that PREA will apply to an original NDA or BLA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the drug or biologic is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, 
advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) was enacted in 2013 with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. The law’s requirements include the quarantine and prompt investigation of a suspect product to determine if it is illegitimate, and notifying trading partners and FDA of any illegitimate product. Drug manufacturers and their collaborators are also required to place a unique product identifier on prescription drug packages. This identifier consists of the National Drug Code, serial number, lot number and expiration date, in the form of a 2 dimensional data matrix barcode that can be read by humans and machines.
Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory requirements and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
The FDA may withdraw a product approval or revoke a biologics license if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, untitled or warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. We may undertake or be required to undertake a product recall.
Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that this review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
Data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original 
active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Regulatory exclusivity in the United States can also include pediatric exclusivity and orphan drug exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which runs from the end of other regulatory exclusivity or patent periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued ‘‘Written Request’’ for such a trial. Orphan drug exclusivity is described below under "Orphan Drugs."
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The PHSA includes an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs, including biologics, intended to treat a rare disease or condition-generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the product for the indication can be recovered by sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease or condition with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care. “Same drug” means a drug that contains the same active moiety if it is a drug composed of small molecules, or the same principal molecular structural features if it is composed of macromolecules and is intended for the same use as a previously approved drug, except that if the subsequent drug can be shown to be clinically superior to the first drug, it will not be considered to be the same drug. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
Zanubrutinib was granted orphan drug designation status by the FDA for the treatment of WM, CLL, MCL and MZL (3 subtypes). Tislelizumab was granted orphan drug designation status by the FDA for the treatment of ESCC, HCC and GC.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure 
of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
In the United States and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs and no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.
Additionally, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective or medically-necessary compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act (the "ACA") contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
Since its enactment, some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial, Congressional, and Executive challenges. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court. Additionally, the former Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business, especially given the new administration.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D from 50% to 70%, effective January 1, 2019, and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.”
In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic. Further, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or otherwise modify the former Trump Administration’s executive and administrative actions after January 20, 2021.
Further, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, former President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. In response, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the "CMS") issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation ("MFN") Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologics based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027. However, in response to a lawsuit filed by several industry groups, on December 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining government defendants from implementing the MFN Rule pending completion of notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. On January 13, 2021, in a separate lawsuit brought by industry groups in the U.S. District of Maryland, the government defendants entered a joint motion to stay litigation on the condition that the government would not appeal the preliminary injunction granted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and that performance for any final regulation stemming from the MFN Interim Final Rule shall not commence earlier than 60 days after publication of that regulation in the Federal Register. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada and the MFN Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for our medicines. Additionally, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the "HHS") finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Implementation of the amendments to the discount safe harbor have been delayed until at least January 1, 2023. Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2023. Further, implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, Congress has each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Presently, the State Medicaid combined represent less than 5% of our overall business in the U.S. While much of the focus of state pricing policies is limited to Medicaid, we cannot assess the impact that these and other measures such as state transparency policies will have on our business.
Moreover, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act or FDA’s expanded access program authorities, but the manufacturer must develop and make publicly available its policy on expanded access availability and respond to patient requests according to that policy. We make available on our website the BeiGene contact information for requesting access to our investigational drugs and expected timeline for us to acknowledge receiving such requests.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy 
regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business prior to and after receiving regulatory approval of our product candidates. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute ("AKS"), which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, providing, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation or arrangement of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, they are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the AKS without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act ("FCA") or federal civil money penalties statute. Violations of the AKS carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, administrative civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. This law applies to our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. On November 20, 2020, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) finalized further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. These rule (with exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, these rules will have on our business;
•federal civil and criminal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the federal FCA, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making or causing a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS constitutes a false of fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Companies that submit claims directly to payors may also be liable under the FCA for the direct submission of such claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil FCA, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Our marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and any future product candidates are subject to scrutiny under this law;
•the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH"), and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates who perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business 
associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs;
•the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the HHS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;
•federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
•federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;
•federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and
•the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment.
The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal AKS and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA or the civil monetary penalties statute. 
Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal AKS and FCA, some of which apply to claims for, and referral of patients for, healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
Similarly, state privacy laws may be broader and require greater protections than HIPAA. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). We will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA and anticipate additional costs and expenses associated with CPRA compliance. Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. While the legislation and proposed regulations including the CCPA and CPRA contain an exception for certain activities that involve PHI subject to HIPAA, we cannot yet determine the impact the CCPA, CPRA or other such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.
Additionally, we are subject to state equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply to healthcare services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not just governmental payors, but also private insurers. These laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or other voluntary industry codes of conduct that restrict the payments made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources. Several states and local laws also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by administrative, criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, individual imprisonment, reputational harm, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal FCA as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
European Data Collection and Privacy Laws
The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals in the EU are governed by, as of May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes several requirements relating to the legal bases for processing personal information, the information provided to the individuals regarding data processing activities, the notification of data breaches, certain measures to take when engaging third-party processors, and the implementation of safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data. GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area. GDPR includes substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of GDPR. In addition, GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Further, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated now that the United Kingdom has left the EU.
PRC Regulation
In the PRC, we operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of PRC laws, rules and regulations affecting many aspects of our business. This section summarizes the principal PRC laws, rules and regulations that we believe are relevant to our business and operations.
PRC Drug Regulation
Introduction
China heavily regulates the development, approval, manufacturing and distribution of drugs, including biologics. The legal framework for the administration of pharmaceutical products in China was established by the Drug Administration Law of the PRC (the "DAL"). The DAL applies to entities and individuals engaged in the development, production, trade, clinical use, as well as supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products by regulatory agencies. It provides for a framework for regulating pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical trading companies, medical institutions, and the research, development, manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing, and advertisement activities related to pharmaceutical products. The Implementing Measures of the Drug Administration Law as amended in 2019 provides detailed implementation regulations for the DAL.
The Revised DAL
The DAL, revised in 2019 (the "rDAL"), embodies an expected regulatory trend to strengthen the life-cycle management of drugs, to balance the development of innovative drugs and generic drugs, and to enhance drug review and enforcement. It also reflects legislative efforts to address prominent problems of the pharmaceutical industry, such as counterfeit and substandard drugs and high drug prices.
The rDAL contains a dedicated chapter on the Marketing Authorization Holder (“MAH”) system. Subject to approval by the NMPA, MAHs will be allowed to transfer their marketing authorizations. It is uncertain whether the transferability of MAH will offer more flexibility in structuring cross-border transactions. In addition, the implementation of the MAH system was accompanied by a range of new requirements for the MAHs. For example, a MAH must establish a quality assurance system and be responsible for the whole process and all aspects of preclinical research, clinical trials, manufacturing and distribution, post-marketing research, adverse drug reaction monitoring and reporting. A foreign MAH is required to engage a local agent to fulfill the MAH’s obligations and the foreign MAH is subject to joint and several liability in the event of any wrongdoing. It is unclear how the scope of such joint liability will be defined.
The rDAL no longer requires the certification for good clinical practice ("GCP"), good supply practice ("GSP"), and GMP. However, drug manufacturers and drug distributors must still comply with current GMP and GSP requirements. Pursuant to the rDAL, NMPA and its local counterparts are directed to strengthen their surveillance of drug manufacturers and distributors, including through regular and continuous site inspections, to ensure their compliance. It remains to be seen how clinical trial institutions will ensure self-compliance with GCP requirements and whether there will be more inspections of clinical trial institutions. 
The rDAL also requires MAHs, manufacturers, distributors, and medical institutions to establish and implement drug track and trace systems. The NMPA will issue related standards and regulations regarding drug track and trace system. A drug pharmacovigilance system will also be established to monitor, identify, evaluate and control adverse drug reactions and other possible drug-related problems.
The rDAL creates an expanded access pathway for investigational drugs under which a company sponsor of a clinical trial in China can apply to establish an expanded access treatment program for patients with life-threatening disease who otherwise do not satisfy the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial. To quality for expanded access: (1) the drug must be used for life-threatening diseases that lack effective treatment; (2) the drug must have demonstrated its potential efficacy based on medical observations; (3) such use is in line with ethical principles; (4) such expanded use has been reviewed and approved (although the approval pathway not clear), and has obtained patients’ informed consent; and (5) the drug must be used within the clinical trial institution and used on patients with similar conditions.
The rDAL also significantly increases and expands penalties for violations. Depending on various types of violations, the DAL imposes different penalties, including warnings, confiscation of illegal gains, fines of up to RMB5 million (about $725,000) or up to 30 times of illegal gains, revocation of required business and operating licenses, certificates or approval documents for drugs, suspension of business, temporary (10 years) or permanent debarment of companies, institutions and responsible persons, and criminal liabilities in the case of serious violations.
There are still uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the rDAL. We plan to closely monitor the implementation of the rDAL and its impact on our operations in China.
Regulatory Authorities and Recent Government Reorganization
In China, the NMPA is the primary regulator for pharmaceutical products and businesses. The agency was newly formed from the prior China Food and Drug Administration ("CFDA") in 2018 as part of a complete government reorganization. The NMPA is no longer an independent agency. Its parent agency is now the newly organized the State Administration of Market Regulation (the “SAMR”), into which agencies responsible for, among other areas, consumer protection, advertising, anticorruption, antitrust, fair competition and intellectual property have been merged.
Like the CFDA, the NMPA is still the chief drug regulatory agency and implements the same laws, regulations, rules, and guidelines as the CFDA, and it regulates almost all of the key stages of the life-cycle of pharmaceutical products, including nonclinical studies, clinical trials, marketing approvals, manufacturing, advertising and promotion, distribution, and pharmacovigilance (i.e., post-marketing safety reporting obligations). The Center for Drug Evaluation ("CDE"), which remains under the NMPA, conducts the technical evaluation of each drug and biologic application for safety and efficacy.
The National Health Commission ("NHC") (formerly known by the names Ministry of Health ("MOH") and National Health and Family Planning Commission ("NHFPC")), is China’s chief healthcare regulator. It is primarily responsible for overseeing the operation of medical institutions, which also serve as clinical trial sites, and regulating the licensure of hospitals and other medical personnel. The NHC plays a significant role in drug reimbursement. Furthermore, the NHC and its local counterparts at or below the provincial-level of local government also oversee and organize public medical institutions’ centralized bidding and procurement programs for pharmaceutical products. This is the primary way that public hospitals and their internal pharmacies procure drugs.
Also, as part of the 2018 reorganization, the PRC government formed a new State Medical Insurance Bureau which focuses on regulating reimbursement under state-sponsored insurance plans.
Preclinical and Clinical Development
The NMPA requires preclinical data to support registration applications for new drugs. Preclinical work, including safety assessment studies, must meet the GLP standards, issued in 2003 and amended in 2017. The rDAL requires the NMPA to accredit GLP labs, and that nonclinical studies of chemical drug substances and preparations and biologics that are not yet marketed in China be conducted in GLP-certified labs. There are no approvals required from the NMPA to conduct preclinical studies.
A Certificate for Use of Laboratory Animals is required for performing experimentation on animals under the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals issued in 1988 and last amended in 2017, the Administrative Measures on Good Practice of Experimental Animals issued in 1997, and the Administrative Measures on the Certificate for Experimental Animals (Trial) issued in 2001. Applicants for this certificate must satisfy a number of conditions, including (1) the environment and facilities for lab animals’ living and propagating must satisfy national requirements; (2) lab animals must be qualified and sourced from institutions with Certificates for Production of Lab Animals; and (3) the animals’ feeding and experimentation must be conducted by professionals, specialized and skilled workers, or other trained personnel.
Registration Categories
Prior to engaging with the NMPA on research and development and approval, an applicant will need to determine the registration category for its drug candidate (which will ultimately need to be confirmed with the NMPA), which will determine the requirements for its clinical trial and marketing application. There are five categories for small molecule drugs: Category 1 (“innovative drugs”) refers to drugs that have a new chemical entity that has not been marketed anywhere in the world, Category 2 (“improved new drugs”) refers to drugs with a new indication, dosage form, route of administration, combination, or certain formulation changes not approved in the world, Categories 3 and 4 are for generics that reference an innovator drug (or certain well-known generic drugs) marketed either abroad or in China, respectively, and Category 5 refers to innovative or generic drugs that have already been marketed abroad but are not yet approved in China (i.e., imported drugs).
Therapeutic biologics follow a similar categorization, with Category 1 being new to the world. Like with small molecule drugs, Category 1 is for innovative biologics that have not been approved inside or outside of China. Biosimilars are under Category 3. Each of zanubrutinib, tislelizumab, pamiparib and lifirafenib is classified as Category 1 based on the defined registration category by the NMPA. Zanubrutinib and tislelizumab have been approved by the NMPA as Category 1 drugs.
Expedited Programs
Priority Evaluation and Approval Programs to Encourage Innovation
The NMPA has adopted several expedited review and approval mechanisms since 2009 and created additional expedited programs in recent years that are intended to encourage innovation. Applications for these expedited programs can be submitted after the CTA is admitted for review by the CDE. The NMPA’s Drug Registration Rules effective from July 1, 2020 (“DRR”) provides certain categories of drugs that may be eligible for priority status, among which, the following may be particularly relevant for us: (1) drugs that are clinically and urgently needed but insufficient in supply; (2) innovative drugs and improved new drugs for prevention and treatment of major contagious diseases and rare diseases; (3) new pediatric drugs, (4) drugs designated as breakthrough therapies, and (5) drugs that satisfy the conditional approval criteria. 
If admitted to one of these expedited programs, an applicant will be entitled to more frequent and timely communication with reviewers at the CDE, expedited review and approval, and more agency resources throughout the approval process. 
Our NDA for pamiparib and our BLAs for QARZIBA® and SYLVANT® have been accepted by CDE and granted priority status.
Conditional Approval
NMPA also permits conditional approval of certain medicines based on early phase data. The agency has done this for medicines that meet unmet medical needs for life-threatening illnesses and also for medicines that treat orphan indications. Under the DRR, drugs that meet one of the three criteria might be eligible for conditional approval: (1) drugs that treat life threatening illnesses for which there are no effective treatment or preventive methods, but their clinical trials already have the data to prove efficacy and their clinical value is predictable, (2) drugs that are urgently needed for public health reasons, and their clinical trials already have the data to prove efficacy and their clinical value is predictable; or (3) vaccines that are urgently needed for major public health emergencies or otherwise deemed by the National Health Commission to be urgently needed, and it is concluded upon evaluation that their benefits outweigh their risks. Following approval, the MAH is required to take risk mitigation measures and complete a post-market study as required by the NMPA within a prescribed timeline.
BRUKINSA® received conditional approval for the treatment of MCL in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy and CLL or SLL in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Tislelizumab received conditional approval as a treatment for patients with cHL who have received at least two prior therapies and as a treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC, a form of bladder cancer, with PD-L1 high expression whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. XGEVA® received conditional approval for the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of the bone (GCTB) that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity 
and for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and in patients with multiple myeloma. BLINCYTO® received conditional approval for the treatment of adult patients with R/R B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation 
Breakthrough therapy designation ("BTD") is a process designed to expedite the development and review of clinical stage, innovative or improved new drugs that meet the following criteria: (1) they are intended to treat life threatening conditions or conditions that have serious negative impact on the quality of life, and (2) there are no effective treatment or preventive methods available, or there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that they may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies. Applicants of drugs designated as breakthrough therapies will be entitled to direct communications with CDE at key states during the clinical trials, and may seek CDE’s opinion on study progress.
Amgen's investigational KRASG12C inhibitor sotorasib was granted BTD in China for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.
New Policies on Expediting Approval of Imported Oncology Drugs
The PRC government continues to establish measures and incentives to promote the development and swifter approval of marketing for oncology and other innovative drugs. Beginning in May 2018, the PRC eliminated tariffs on a significant number of imported innovative drugs, including oncology drugs, making the importation process more efficient. The PRC government has also stated that it will explore ways to expand access to reimbursement under the state health plans for innovative drugs (particularly for urgently needed oncology drugs).
Clinical Trials and Marketing Approval
Upon completion of preclinical studies and preliminary CMC studies, a sponsor typically needs to conduct clinical trials in China for registering a new drug. The materials required for this application and the data requirements are determined by the registration category. The NMPA has taken a number of steps to increase efficiency for approving CTAs, and it has also significantly increased monitoring and enforcement of GCP to ensure data integrity.
 Clinical Trial Approval
All clinical trials conducted in China for the purpose of seeking marketing approvals must be approved by the NMPA and conducted at hospitals satisfying GCP requirements. In addition to a standalone China trial to support development, imported drug applicants may include Chinese clinical sites as part of an international multicenter trial (“IMCT”). Domestically manufactured drugs are not subject to foreign approval requirements, and in contrast to prior practice, the NMPA has decided to permit those drugs to conduct development via an IMCT as well.
The rDAL has now also adopted an implied approval system for clinical trials of new drugs. Trials can proceed if after 60 business days, the applicant has not received any objections from the CDE, as opposed to the lengthier previous clinical trial pre-approval process in which the applicant had to wait for affirmative approval. The rDAL also expands the number of trial sites by abolishing the GCP accreditation system and requiring trial sites to follow a more simplified notification procedure.
Clinical Trial Register 
Clinical trials conducted in China must be registered and published through the Drug Clinical Trial Information Platform (http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn). Applicant are required to pre-register the trial information within one month after obtaining the clinical trial approval to obtain the trial’s unique registration number and to complete registration of certain follow-up information before the first subject’s enrollment in the trial. If the foregoing pre-registration and registration is not obtained within one year after obtaining the clinical trial approval, the applicant shall submit an explanation, and if the procedure is not completed within three years, the clinical trial approval automatically expires.
Human Genetic Resources Regulation
The Regulation on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources ("HGR Regulation") became effective on July 1, 2019. The HGR Regulation applies to all human genetic resources (HGR)-related activities for R&D purposes, including sampling, biobanking, use of HGR materials and associated data in China, and the provision or sharing of such materials or data with foreign parties.
The HGR Regulation applies to foreign parties, including foreign entities and entities established or actually controlled by foreign entities and individuals. As BeiGene, Ltd. is a Cayman Islands company, we and our activities in China are subject to 
the HGR Regulation. Such foreign parties seeking access to China’s HGRs for scientific research, including clinical trials intended to support marketing approval of drugs and medical devices in China, must do so only through collaborations with Chinese parties, such as Chinese hospitals. The HGR Regulation prohibits foreign parties from independently sampling or biobanking any China HGR in China and requires approval for the sampling of certain HGR and biobanking of all HGR by Chinese parties. Any cross-border transfer of the HGR materials, either under an international collaboration or as a direct export, must be on an as-needed basis and requires approval. In addition, providing HGR data to foreign parties requires a record filing.
Another significant change is the HGR Regulation replaced the advance approval requirement with a record-filing procedure for international collaborations on clinical trials intended to support marketing approval of drugs in China that do not transfer HGR materials abroad, while the advance approval requirement still applies if such trials involve export of HGR materials or the collection, testing, analysis or disposals of HGR samples during the trials are not solely conducted at the clinical trial sites. Companies conducting global clinical trials may benefit little from this record filing procedure because those trials would often require cross-border transfer of HGR materials and the advance approval requirement would still apply.
The HGR Regulation retains the provision in the Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources issued in 1998 (the "Interim Measures") that parties should jointly apply for and own the patent rights arising from the results generated from international collaborations that utilize China HGR. Subject to approval, the parties may contractually agree on how to dispose of their patent rights and non-patent proprietary rights arising from the collaboration. As the joint ownership requirement is rather broad, it is unclear how this requirement will be implemented in practice.
The HGR Regulation also significantly increases and expands penalties for various violations, including warnings, disgorgement of illegal gains, confiscation of illegal HGR, fines up to RMB10 million ($1,450,000) or 5-10 times of illegal gains in the event such illegal gains exceed RMB1 million ($145,000), and temporary (1-5 years) or permanent debarment of companies, institutions and responsible persons from future HGR projects regulated by the HGR Regulation.
We expect that HGR-related activities will receive greater attention and focus from regulators going forward.
Trial Exemptions and Acceptance of Foreign Data
The NMPA may be flexible on the requirements of trials and data generated in China, depending on the drug and the existing data.The NMPA has granted waivers for all or part of trials, and has stated that it will accept data generated abroad (even if not part of a global study), including early phase data, that meets its requirements. In 2018, the NMPA issued the Technical Guidance Principles on Accepting Foreign Drug Clinical Trial Data (the “Guidance Principles”), as one of the implementing rules for the Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Evaluation and Approval Systems and Encouraging Innovation on Drugs and Medical Devices (the “Innovation Opinion”). According to the Guidance Principles, data from foreign clinical trials must meet authenticity, completeness and accuracy requirements and such data must be obtained in compliance with the relevant requirements under the GCP of the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (the "ICH"). Sponsors must be attentive to potentially meaningful ethnic differences in the subject population.
The NMPA now permits, and its predecessor agencies have permitted on a case-by-case basis in the past, drugs approved outside of China to be approved in China on a conditional basis without the need for pre-approval clinical trials in China. Specifically, in 2018, the NMPA established a program permitting drugs that have been approved within the last ten years in the United States, EU or Japan to be approved in China without local clinical trials if they (1) prevent or treat orphan diseases, (2) prevent or treat serious life-threatening illnesses for which there is either no effective therapy in China, or for which the foreign-approved drug would have clear clinical advantages. Applicants for such conditional approvals will be required to establish a risk mitigation plan and may be required to complete trials in China after the drug is approved. The CDE has developed a list of drugs that meet these criteria.
Clinical Trial Process and Good Clinical Practices
As in other parts of the world, clinical trials in China typically have three phases. Phase 1 refers to the initial clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies. Phase 2 refers to the preliminary evaluation of a drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy and safety for target indication(s) in patients. Phase 3 (often the pivotal study) refers to clinical trials to further verify the drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy and safety on patients with target indication(s) and ultimately provide sufficient evidence for the review of a drug registration application. The NMPA requires that the different phases of clinical trials in China receive ethics committee approval and comply with GCP. The NMPA conducts inspections on clinical trials conducted in China to assess GCP compliance and may refuse to approve the drug if it finds substantial issues in the trials. In addition, upon granting the drug registration certificate, NMPA may, at its sole discretion, require a Phase 4 trial to be conducted by MAH within a specified period of time so as to further monitor and obtain safety and efficacy data of the drug.
Generic small molecule drugs are required to conduct a bioequivalence trial, in vitro studies or in some cases a clinical trial to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to an innovator drug marketed either in China or abroad or an internationally accepted generic drug. The NMPA has released catalogues of reference products, and it released first installment of a Marketed Drug List (China’s “Orange Book”) with information about drugs that may serve as reference products.
Pursuant to GCP, sponsors of clinical trials are responsible for proper packaging and labeling of drugs used for clinical trials, and in double-blinded clinical trials, the investigational drugs shall be consistent with the control drug or placebo in appearance, odor, packaging, labeling, and certain other features. Pharmaceutical packaging must comply with national and professional standards. If there is no national or professional standard available, companies may formulate and implement its own standards after obtaining the approval of the provincial administration for medical products or bureau of standards. Changes in such approved packaging standards need to be re-approved. Drugs of which the packaging standards are not approved shall not be released or marketed in China, except for those specifically supplied to the military.
New Drug Application ("NDA") and Approval
Upon completion of clinical trials, a sponsor may submit clinical trial data to support marketing approval for the drug.
For domestically manufactured drugs, NDA sponsors must submit data derived from the submitted drugs in support of their approval. Under the rDAL, upon approval of the registration application, the NMPA will issue a drug registration certificate to the applicant which is in fact the marketing approval of the drug, and the applicant is no longer required to be equipped with relevant manufacturing capability.
Manufacturing and Distribution
All facilities that manufacture drugs in China must receive a drug manufacturing license with an appropriate “scope of manufacturing” from the local drug regulatory authority. This license must be renewed every five years, and the manufacturing facility is also required to be in compliance with GMP.
Similarly, to conduct sales, importation, shipping and storage, a company must obtain a Drug Distribution License from the local drug regulatory authority, subject to renewal every five years. As with GMPs, companies are required to be in compliance with GSP.
China has developed a “Two-Invoice System” to control distribution of prescription drugs. The “Two-Invoice System” generally requires that no more than two invoices may be issued throughout the distribution chain, with one from the manufacturer to a distributor and another from the distributor to the end-user hospital. This excludes the sale of products invoiced from the manufacturer to its wholly owned or controlled distributors, or for imported drugs, to their exclusive distributor, or from a distributor to its wholly owned or controlled subsidiary (or between the wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries). However, the system still significantly limits the options for companies to use multiple distributors to reach a larger geographic area in China. Compliance with the Two-Invoice System is a prerequisite for pharmaceutical companies to participate in procurement processes with public hospitals, which currently provide most of China’s healthcare. Manufacturers and distributors that fail to implement the Two-Invoice System may lose their qualifications to participate in the bidding process. Non-compliant manufacturers may also be blacklisted from engaging in drug sales to public hospitals in a locality.
Post-Marketing Surveillance
Under the rDAL, the MAH of a drug is ultimately responsible for pharmacovigilance, including quality assurance, adverse reaction reporting and monitoring, and product recalls. Distributors and user entities (e.g., hospitals) are also required to report, in their respective roles, adverse reactions of the products they sell or use, and assist the MAH with any product recalls. An MAH for a drug that is currently under the new drug monitoring period has to report all adverse drug reactions (as opposed to just serious adverse reactions) for that period.
Advertising and Promotion of Pharmaceutical Products
China has a strict regime for the advertising of approved medicines. No unapproved medicines may be advertised. The definition of an advertisement is very broad, and does not expressly exclude scientific exchange. It can be any media that directly or indirectly introduces the product to end users. There is no clear line between advertising and any other type of promotion.
An enterprise seeking to advertise a prescription drug may do so only in medical journals jointly approved by NMPA and the NHC, and each advertisement requires approval from a local drug regulatory authority. The content of an approved advertisement may not be altered without filing a new application for approval.
Prescription drug advertisements are subject to strict content restrictions, which prohibit recommendations by doctors and hospitals and guarantees of effectiveness. Advertising that includes content that is outside of the drug’s approval documentation (“off-label content”) is prohibited. False advertising can result in civil suits from end users and administrative liability, including fines. In addition to advertisements, non-promotional websites that convey information about a drug must go through a separate approval process by a local drug regulatory authority.
Regulatory Intellectual Property Protections
In January 2020, the United States and China signed the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the PRC (the “Trade Agreement”). Among other things, China agreed to provide for effective protection and enforcement of pharmaceutical-related intellectual property rights, including patents and undisclosed test or other data submitted as a condition of marketing approval, as further described below. These provisions of the Trade Agreement will need to be implemented in China. In October 2020, amendments to the PRC Patent Law (the “Amended PRC Patent Law”) were adopted that will become effective on June 1, 2021. The Amended PRC Patent Law contains both patent term extension and a mechanism for early resolution of patent disputes, which may be comparable to patent linkage in the United States. However, the provisions for patent term extension and an early resolution mechanism are unclear and/or remain subject to the approval of implementing regulations that are still in draft form or have not yet been proposed, leading to uncertainty about their scope and implementation.
Non-Patent Exclusivities
New Drug Monitoring Period
Previously, new varieties of domestically produced drugs approved under Categories 1 or 2 in China could be placed under a monitoring period for three to five years. Category 1 innovative drugs were monitored for five years. During the monitoring period, the NMPA would not approve another CTA from another applicant for the same type of drug, except if another sponsor had an approved CTA at the time that the monitoring period was initiated, it could proceed with its trial and once approved become another drug that was part of the monitoring period. The DRR has abolished these new drug monitoring period programs; however, drugs that had been placed under a monitoring period before the DRR took effect are still entitled to exclusivity before the monitoring periods end. 
Regulatory Data Protection 
The Innovation Opinion provided a foundation to improve and implement a system for regulatory data protection to protect innovative drugs. This protection will be available for undisclosed clinical trial data of drugs falling into the following categories: innovative drugs, innovative therapeutic biologics, drugs that treat orphan diseases, pediatric drugs, and drugs for which there has been a successful patent challenge. In the Trade Agreement, China has committed to providing for effective protection of undisclosed clinical trial or other data submitted as a condition of marketing approval. 
The NMPA has published draft regulations for public comment that would set regulatory data protection for innovative small molecule drugs at six years and for innovative therapeutic biologics at 12 years; pediatric and orphan drugs would receive six years to run concurrently from their approval dates. Full terms of protection would require reliance on local trials or sites of multi-center trials in China and simultaneous submissions of marketing applications in China and other countries. Submissions in China that are up to six years later than those abroad would result in the term being reduced to 1-5 years. Submissions over six years later in China may not receive protection.
The proposed regulations also call for a reduction in exclusivity if the marketing application is filed in China based solely on overseas clinical data with no Chinese subjects (75% reduction) or based on supplemental “China clinical trial data” (50% reduction). Information about the exclusivity term will be included in a Marketed Drug List (similar to the Orange Book in the US) at the time of approval. Some mechanics of these proposed rules are not yet clear, and it is not certain when the proposed rules will be finalized.
Patent-Related Protections 
Patent Linkage
The Innovation Opinion also sets forth the basic elements of a patent linkage system to protect innovators, in which a follow-on applicant will be required to specify patents that are relevant to its application and notify relevant patent right holders (including, innovators) within a specified period after filing its application, permitting them to sue to protect their rights. The system will require that the NMPA continue to review the potentially infringing follow-on application during any lawsuit by the innovator. However, the NMPA may not approve the follow-on application pending resolution of the patent litigation in favor of the follow-on application or for a specified period of time, whichever is shorter. Similarly, the Trade Agreement also adopted 
certain elements of a patent linkage system: notice to the patent right holder of the follow-on application; and time and opportunity for that right holder to sue and seek expeditious remedies to obtain a timely resolution of the patent dispute. However, the Trade Agreement did not explicitly mention a stay of marketing approval of the follow-on application.
The Amended PRC Patent Law provides a cause of action to allow a patent holder to initiate a declarative action during the regulatory review process of a drug to determine whether the drug falls within the patent scope, which may be comparable to the patent linkage system in the United States. However, the provisions for the early resolution mechanism are unclear and/or remain subject to the approval of implementing regulations that are still in draft form, leading to uncertainty about the scope of implementation.
Patent Term Extension
In early 2019, pursuant to the Innovation Opinion, the National People’s Congress issued a proposal for patent term extension as part of a proposed amendment to the Patent Law. Under this proposal, the State Council may grant a patent term extension of up to five years to compensate for delays in the review process for innovative drugs that are applying simultaneously for marketing approval in both China and abroad. The patent term may not be extended to more than 14 years post-marketing. The Trade Agreement also provides for patent term extension to compensate for unreasonable delay that occurs during pharmaceutical product marketing approvals.
The Amended PRC Patent Law provides that the China National Intellectual Property Administration shall provide patent term extension, similar to the United States, for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process of a new drug upon the patent holder’s request. The extended term shall not exceed five years, and the total patent term after market entry of the new drug shall not exceed 14 years. However, the provisions for patent term extension are unclear and/or remain subject to the approval of implementing regulations that are still in draft form, leading to uncertainty about the scope of implementation.
Reimbursement and Pricing
China’s national medical insurance program currently consists of two fundamental sub-programs: (1) the basic medical insurance program for urban employees, under which urban employers are required to enroll their employees in the program and the insurance premium is jointly contributed by the employers and employees; and (2) the basic medical insurance program for urban and rural residents, which allows urban and rural residents who do not have employers to voluntarily participate in the basic medical insurance program and the insurance premium is jointly contributed by the participants and the government. Participants of the national medical insurance program and their employers, if any, are required to contribute to the payment of insurance premiums on a monthly basis. Program participants are eligible for full or partial reimbursement of the cost of medicines included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (the "NRDL"). A pharmaceutical product listed in the NRDL must be clinically needed, safe, effective, reasonably priced, easy to use, and available in sufficient quantity.
Factors that affect the inclusion of a pharmaceutical product in the NRDL include whether the product is used in large volumes and commonly prescribed for clinical use in the PRC and whether it is considered to be important in meeting the basic healthcare needs of the general public. Since 2016, special consideration has been given to, among others, innovative drugs with high clinical value and drugs for serious diseases. In addition, the government has also been negotiating with manufacturers of expensive drugs with high clinical demands and proven effectiveness for price cuts in exchange for inclusion into the NRDL. The version of the NRDL released in 2021 covers 2,800 drugs in total, including 221 drugs for which the prices were determined through negotiations between the drug companies and government. China has been pursuing a policy of expediting the addition of innovative oncology drugs to this list. REVLIMID® has been included in the NRDL since 2017. VIDAZA® has been included in the NRDL since 2018. BRUKINSA®(zanubrutinib), tislelizumab, and XGEVA® (120-mg denosumab) will be included in the NRDL in March 2021.
Government Price Controls
China has abolished its previous government-led pricing system for drugs, and lifted the maximum retail price for most drugs, including drugs reimbursed by government medical insurance funds, patented drugs, and some other drugs. The government now regulates prices mainly by establishing a consolidated procurement mechanism, restructuring medical insurance reimbursement standards and strengthening regulation of medical and pricing practices, as discussed below.
Centralized Procurement and Tenders
Under current regulations, public medical institutions owned by the government or owned by state-owned or controlled enterprises are required to purchase pharmaceutical products through centralized online procurement processes. There are exceptions for drugs on the National List of Essential Drugs, which must comply with their own procurement rules, and for 
certain drugs subject to the central government’s special control, such as toxic, radioactive and narcotic drugs, and traditional Chinese medicines.
The centralized procurement process takes the form of public tenders that are typically conducted once every year by provincial or municipal-level government agencies. The bids are assessed by a committee randomly selected from a database of experts. The committee members assess the bids based on a number of factors, including bid price, product quality, clinical effectiveness, product safety, level of technology, the manufacturer's qualifications and reputation, after-sale services and innovation.
Over the last decade, the government has employed various methods to improve the affordability of drugs. In 2009, the central government announced a campaign to implement a “zero markup” policy on essential drugs among basic healthcare institutions, which has been fully implemented nationwide. In addition, some local governments have begun to allow medical institutions to collectively negotiate with manufacturers for a second price to further lower the already agreed bid price. The Two-Invoice System, described above, is also designed to reduce price mark-ups brought about by multi-tier distribution chains.
In 2019, the government approved a volume-based, centralized drug procurement program in an effort to deepen the reform of the medical and health sector and optimize the pricing of drugs. Drugs are selected from generic brands for volume-based, centralized drug procurement. The selected drugs must pass the equivalence evaluation on quality and efficacy. The program is aimed at further lowering drug costs for patients, reducing transaction costs for enterprises, regulating drug use by institutions, and improving the centralized drug procurement and pricing system. All approved enterprises that produce drugs on the procurement list in China may participate. Clinical effects, adverse reactions, and batch stability of the drugs will be considered, and their consistency will be the main criteria for evaluation, while production capacity and stability of the supplier will also be considered.
Other PRC National and Provincial Laws and Regulations
Pharmaceutical companies operating in China are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national, provincial and municipal levels, some of which are or may become applicable to our business. For example, regulations control the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our information systems or released by us to third parties. The privacy of human subjects in clinical trials is also protected under regulations. For example, clinical trial case report forms must avoid disclosing names of human subjects.
These laws and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future, including restrictions on transfer of healthcare data. The Cybersecurity Law that took effect in 2017 designates healthcare as a priority area that is part of critical information infrastructure, and China’s cyberspace administration is working to finalize a draft rule on cross-border transfer of personal information.
PRC Regulation of Foreign Investment
The Foreign Investment Law of the PRC (the “Foreign Investment Law”) and its implementing rules (the “Implementing Rules”) took effect in 2020 and replaced previous laws and regulations governing foreign investment in China. The Foreign Investment Law and Implementating Rules establish a basic framework for access to, and the promotion and administration of foreign investments in China. They reflected China’s legislative efforts to rationalize China’s foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and to unify legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. The Implementing Rules further clarified that China would encourage and promote foreign investment, protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign investors, and continue to improve the foreign investment environment in China.
The Foreign Investment Law establishes a pre-entry national treatment and negative list system for the administration of foreign investments. “Pre-entry national treatment” means that the treatment afforded to foreign investors at the market access stage shall be no less favorable than that afforded to domestic investors. “Negative list” refers to the special administrative measures for foreign investors' access to specific fields or industries. Foreign investments outside of the negative list will be granted national treatment. Foreign investors shall not invest in the prohibited fields as specified in the negative list, and foreign investors who invest in the restricted fields shall comply with certain special requirements including the shareholding percentage and citizenship of senior executives. The current industry entry clearance requirements governing foreign investment activities in the PRC are set out in two categories, namely the Special Entry Management Measures for the Access of Foreign Investment (2019 version) (the “Negative List”), and the Encouraged Industry Catalogue for Foreign Investment (2019 version) (the “2019 Encouraged Industry Catalogue”). Industries not listed in these two categories are generally deemed “permitted” for foreign investments unless specifically restricted by other applicable PRC laws or regulations. Pursuant to the 
2019 Encouraged Industry Catalogue, the research, development and manufacture of innovative oncology drugs and certain other types of pharmaceutical products belongs to the encouraged industries for foreign investment.
Regulations Relating to Product Liability
Under a new law which took effect in 2021, a defective product which causes property damage or physical injury to any person may subject the manufacturer or vendor of such product to civil liability for such damage or injury. Additionally, China's Product Quality Law, first adopted in 1993 and most recently amended in 2018, governs the supervision and administration of product quality, aiming to protect the rights end-users and consumers. According to the Product Quality Law, manufacturers is liable for the quality of products produced by them, and sellers are required take measures to ensure the quality of the products sold by them. A manufacturer is liable for compensating for any bodily injury or property damage resulting from product defects unless the manufacturer is able to prove that: (1) the product was not distributed; (2) the defects causing injury or damage did not exist at the time that the product was distributed; or (3) science and technology at the time that the product was distributed was at a level incapable of detecting the defects. A seller is liable for compensating for any bodily injury or property damage of others caused by the defects in the product if such defects are attributable to the seller. A seller is required t pay compensation if it fails to indicate either the manufacturer or the supplier of the defective product. A person who is injured or whose property is damaged by the defects in the product may claim compensation from the manufacturer or the seller. 
Regulations Relating to Commercial Bribery
Pharmaceutical companies involved in a criminal investigation or administrative proceeding related to bribery are listed in the Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies by the provincial health commissions. If a pharmaceutical company or its agent is listed, public medical institutions located in the local provincial level region are prohibited from making any purchase from the company for two years. Where a pharmaceutical company or its agent is listed in the adverse records on two or more occasions within five years, all public medical institutions in China are not permitted to purchase any products from that company for two years.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange
The Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations are the principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("SAFE") by complying with certain procedural requirements. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities or designated banks is required when RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.
Under current regulations, the capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and capital in RMB obtained by the foreign-invested enterprise from foreign exchange settlement must not be used for the following purposes: directly or indirectly for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; directly or indirectly for investment in securities, unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; extending loans to non-related parties, unless permitted by the scope of business; or paying expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use, except for real estate enterprises.
In 2017, new regulations were adopted which, among other things, relax the restrictions on foreign exchange inflow to further enhance trade and investment facilitation and tighten genuineness and compliance verification of cross-border transactions and cross-border capital flows.
In 2019, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment (“Circular 28”). Circular 28 allows non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to use their capital funds to make equity investments in China, provided that such investments do not violate the effective special entry management measures for foreign investment (negative list) and the target investment projects are genuine and in compliance with laws. The interpretation and implementation of Circular 28 in practice are subject to substantial uncertainty.
Regulations Relating to Dividend Distributions
Foreign-invested companies may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and foreign invested PRC companies are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserve funds until the aggregate amount of these reserve funds have reached 50% of the registered capital of the companies. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
Labor Laws and Social Insurance
Under Chinese law, employers must execute written labor contracts with their full-time employees and must comply with local minimum wage standards. Employers must establish a comprehensive management system to protect the rights of their employees, including a system governing occupational health and safety, and to truthfully inform prospective employees of the job description, working conditions, location, occupational hazards and status of safe production as well as remuneration and other conditions. Violations of these requirements may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations.
In addition, employers must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing funds. These payments are made to local administrative authorities, and any employer who fails to contribute may be fined and ordered to pay the deficit amount within a stipulated time limit.
Rest of World Regulation
For other countries outside of the United States and the PRC, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement, and other matters impacting our business vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
