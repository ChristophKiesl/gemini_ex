Item 1. Business
Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on May 29, 2007 as “Heckmann Corporation.” On May 16, 2013, we changed our name to Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. When used in this Annual Report, the terms “Nuverra,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified.
Overview and Operations
Nuverra provides water logistics and oilfield services to customers focused on the development and ongoing production of oil and natural gas from shale formations in the United States. Our business operations are organized into three geographically distinct divisions: the Rocky Mountain division, the Northeast division, and the Southern division. Within each division, we provide water transfer services, disposal services, and rental and other services associated with the drilling, completion, and ongoing production of shale oil and natural gas. 
Rocky Mountain Division
The Rocky Mountain division is our Bakken Shale area business. The Bakken and underlying Three Forks shale formations are the two primary oil producing reservoirs currently being developed in this geographic region, which covers western North Dakota, eastern Montana, northwestern South Dakota and southern Saskatchewan. According to the Assumptions to the Annual Energy Outlook 2020: Oil and Gas Supply Module report issued in January of 2020 by the United States Energy Information Administration with data as of January 1, 2018 (the “EIA 2020 Report”), the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations contain an estimated 16.9 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil reserves and 12.0 trillion cubic feet (or “Tcf”) of technically recoverable natural gas. The EIA 2020 Report notes that estimates of technically recoverable resources are highly uncertain, with early estimates tending to vary and shift significantly over time as new geological information is gained through drilling, or as long-term productivity is clarified or improved through technology and better management practices. 
We have operations in various locations throughout North Dakota and Montana, including yards in Dickinson, Williston, Watford City, Tioga, Stanley, and Beach, North Dakota, as well as Sidney, Montana. Additionally, we operate a financial support office in Minot, North Dakota. As of December 31, 2019, we had 353 employees in the Rocky Mountain division. 
Water Transfer Services 
We manage a fleet of 204 trucks in the Rocky Mountain division that collect and transport flowback water from drilling and completion activities, and produced water from ongoing well production activities, to either our own or third party disposal wells throughout the region. Additionally, our trucks collect and transport fresh water from water sources to operator locations for use in well completion activities. 
In the Rocky Mountain division, we own an inventory of lay flat temporary hose as well as related pumps and associated equipment used to move fresh water from water sources to operator locations for use in completion activities. We employ specially trained field personnel to manage and operate this business. For customers who have secured their own source of fresh water, we provide and operate the lay flat temporary hose equipment to move the fresh water to the drilling and completion location. We may also use third-party sources of fresh water in order to provide the water to customers as a package that includes our water transfer service. 
Disposal Services
We manage a network of 20 owned and leased salt water disposal wells with current capacity of approximately 82 thousand barrels of water per day, and permitted capacity of 103 thousand barrels of water per day. Our salt water disposal wells in the Rocky Mountain division are operated under the Landtech brand. Additionally, we operate a landfill facility near Watford City, North Dakota that handles the disposal of drill cuttings and other oilfield waste generated from drilling and completion activities in the region. The landfill is located on a 50-acre site with current permitted capacity of more than 1.7 million cubic yards of airspace. We believe that permitted capacity at this site could be expanded up to a total of 5.8 million cubic yards in the future. 
Rental and Other Services 
5

We maintain and lease rental equipment to oil and gas operators and others within the Rocky Mountain division. These assets include tanks, loaders, manlifts, light towers, winch trucks, and other miscellaneous equipment used in drilling and completion activities. In the Rocky Mountain division, we also provide oilfield labor services, also called “roustabout work,” where our employees move, set-up and maintain the rental equipment for customers, in addition to providing other oilfield labor services. 
Northeast Division
The Northeast division is comprised of the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas, both of which are predominantly natural gas producing basins. The Marcellus and Utica Shale areas are located in the northeastern United States, primarily in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York and Ohio. According to the EIA 2020 Report, the Marcellus shale area is the largest natural gas field in North America with approximately 310.6 Tcf of technically recoverable natural gas and 1.3 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil reserves, while the Utica shale area is estimated to have approximately 249.0 Tcf of technically recoverable natural gas and 1.1 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil reserves. 
We have operations in various locations throughout Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio, including yards in Masontown, West Virginia, Somerset and Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, and Cadiz, Ohio. Additionally, we operate a corporate support office near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2019, we had 236 employees in the Northeast division.
Water Transfer Services 
We manage a fleet of 201 trucks in the Northeast division that collect and transport flowback water from drilling and completion activities, and produced water from ongoing well production activities, to either our own or third party disposal wells throughout the region, or to other customer locations for reuse in completing other wells. Additionally, our trucks collect and transport fresh water from water sources to operator locations for use in well completion activities. 
Disposal Services
We manage a network of 14 owned and leased salt water disposal wells with current and permitted capacity of approximately 32 thousand barrels of water per day in the Northeast division. Our salt water disposal wells in the Northeast division are operated under the Nuverra, Heckmann, and Clearwater brands. 
Rental and Other Services 
We maintain and lease rental equipment to oil and gas operators and others within the Northeast division. These assets include tanks and winch trucks used in drilling and completion activities. 
Southern Division
The Southern division is comprised of the Haynesville Shale area, a predominantly natural gas producing basin, which is located across northwestern Louisiana and eastern Texas, and extends into southwestern Arkansas. The Haynesville shale area is the fourth largest natural gas-producing basin in North America, with an estimated 174.2 Tcf of technically recoverable natural gas according to the EIA 2020 Report. 
We have operations in various locations throughout eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana, including a yard in Frierson, Louisiana. Additionally, we operate a corporate support office in Spring, Texas. As of December 31, 2019, we had 71 employees in the Southern division.
Water Transfer Services 
We manage a fleet of 34 trucks in the Southern division that collect and transport flowback water from drilling and completion activities, and produced water from ongoing well production activities, to either our own or third party disposal wells throughout the region. Additionally, our trucks collect and transport fresh water to operator locations for use in well completion activities. 
In the Southern division, we also own and operate a 60-mile underground twin pipeline network for the collection of produced water for transport to interconnected disposal wells and the delivery of fresh water from water sources to operator locations for use in well completion activities. The pipeline network can currently handle disposal volumes up to approximately 71 thousand barrels per day with 7 disposal wells attached to the pipeline and is scalable up to approximately 100 thousand barrels per day.

We manage a network of 7 owned and leased salt water disposal wells that are not connected to our pipeline with current capacity of approximately 48 thousand barrels of water per day, and permitted capacity of approximately 100 thousand barrels of water per day. 
Rental and Other Services
We maintain and lease rental equipment to oil and gas operators and others within the Southern division. These assets include tanks and winch trucks used in drilling and completion activities. 
Business Strategy
Nuverra strives to be a leader in the oilfield services sector by providing value to our customers through an integrated service offering of water management solutions. Our strategy is focused on: (1) reinvesting in our core business in order to drive organic growth and provide a stable revenue stream, (2) maximizing our asset base to capitalize on favorable industry trends, (3) providing high quality, safe and reliable service to our customers, (4) hiring, training and retaining the best employees and (5) applying technology to optimize and streamline transaction processing. 
We try to focus on the produced water sub-sector across our geographies as produced water is generated with or without drilling rig activity. While prices fluctuate throughout each industry cycle, produced water volumes typically increase or remain relatively stable. Spears & Associates, an industry market share research firm, estimates in their January 2020 report entitled, “The US Oilfield Water Management Services Market” (the “Report”) that produced water volumes for disposal are projected to increase at a 2% compounded annual growth rate over the 2019 to 2025 timeframe. 
Through our network of assets strategically located in the Rocky Mountain, Northeast and Southern regions, we have built a strong reputation in the industry by providing our customers with excellent service quality over many years. Nonetheless, we maintain rigorous focus on the key buying factors that determine whether our customer will use our services, such as: commitment to health, safety and environment (“HS&E”); service quality including regulatory compliance; price; capacity and proximity; and technology. We continue to evolve our service offerings to address the critical value drivers while adapting to the changing water management industry. The current trend of integrated gathering and disposal systems is driving increased use of water pipelines, although not all geographic regions are able to utilize pipelines in a cost effective manner due to terrain and other limiting factors. Our saltwater disposal wells (or “SWDs”) and pipeline are an integral part of our produced water business that provide core assets we can leverage to provide incremental offerings on existing disposal and water midstream projects. We are also evaluating additional service line growth opportunities. As we continue to refine our portfolio and footprint, we may consider opportunistic asset sales to provide additional capital to fund our growth investments. 
Market Overview
Nuverra operates in the large and fragmented market for water management. Spears & Associates estimates in their Report that the 2019 market size in the United States (or “U.S.”) for oilfield water management will be approximately $23.2 billion. The primary services in Spears & Associates’ market estimate include water disposal, water hauling, water treatment, water acquisition, water storage, water flowback, and water transfer services. Nuverra provides the majority of these services, but does not have a presence in all U.S. geographic markets. Therefore, management believes there is significant opportunity for market share gains as the Company expands its resources. Spears & Associates’ projects in their Report that the U.S. oilfield water hauling market will be approximately $6.6 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $8.0 billion in 2025 for a compounded annual growth rate of 4% over the 2019 to 2025 timeframe.
From a geographic perspective, Nuverra remains focused on being the premier service provider in our core areas of the Bakken, Marcellus, Utica, and Haynesville basins. We continue to evaluate growth opportunities in other areas. However, we do not plan to enter a market unless we believe we can generate attractive profitability and returns on invested capital. While some basins offer significant levels of activity, attractive economics for certain service providers are not assured given the amount of competition in those basins.
A significant part of the Company’s service offering involves trucking operations. Nuverra’s fleet of approximately 440 trucks positions the Company among the top 100 Private Carriers according to Transport Topics’ 2019 Top 100 Private Carriers. The Company is experiencing the same driver shortage challenge that most U.S. trucking companies are facing. Drivers decreased by 3% during 2019 despite efforts to increase truck driver recruitment and retention during the year. Hiring and retaining qualified drivers continues to be a top initiative for 2020. 
In general, drilling and completion activities in the oil and natural gas industry are affected by the market prices (or anticipated prices) for those commodities. However, there is no guarantee that oil and natural gas prices will remain stable or increase, drilling and completion activities in basins will remain stable or increase, or we will continue to see demand for our services.

Oil and natural gas prices remain volatile and another prolonged downturn in oil and natural gas prices, or a decrease in completion activities could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future.
Customers
Our customers include major domestic and international oil and natural gas companies, foreign national oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our three largest customers represented 31% of our total consolidated revenues. The loss of any one of these three customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Competition
Our competition includes small regional service providers, as well as larger companies with operations throughout the continental United States and internationally. Some of our competitors are Select Energy Services, Inc., Key Energy Services, Inc., Basic Energy Services, Inc., C&J Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Clean Harbors, Inc., TETRA Technologies, Inc., MBI Energy Services, Inc., Stallion Oilfield Services, LLC, Waste Connections, Inc., Pinnergy, Ltd., McKenzie Energy Partners, LLC, and Buckhorn Energy Services, LLC. 
Health, Safety & Environment
We are committed to excellence in HS&E in our operations, which we believe is a critical characteristic of our business. Our customers in the unconventional shale basins require us to meet high standards on HS&E matters. As a result, we believe that being a leading environmental solutions company with a national presence and a dedicated focus on environmental solutions is a competitive advantage relative to smaller, regional companies, as well as companies that provide certain environmental services as ancillary offerings.
Seasonality
Certain of our business divisions are impacted by seasonal factors. Generally, our business is negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours and holidays. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may be unable to move our trucks and equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenue. In addition, these conditions may impact our customers’ operations, and, as our customers’ drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing activities are curtailed, our services may also be reduced.
Intellectual Property
We operate under numerous trade names and own several trademarks, the most important of which are “Nuverra,” “HWR,” “Power Fuels,” and “Heckmann Water Resources.” 
Operating Risks
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in our industry, including accidents and fires that could cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment, suspension of operations and litigation, as described in Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, associated with these hazards. Because our business involves the transportation of environmentally regulated materials, we may also experience traffic accidents or pipeline breaks that may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. We have implemented a comprehensive HS&E program designed to minimize accidents in the workplace, enhance our safety programs, maintain environmental compliance and improve the efficiency of our operations.
Governmental Regulation, Including Environmental Regulation and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to stringent United States federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Additional laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that affect our business and operations may be adopted, which may in turn impact our financial condition. The following is a summary of the more significant existing HS&E laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law), and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on 
8

certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
While we do not believe our operations raise climate change issues different from those generally raised by the commercial use of fossil fuels, legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business or that would require reducing emissions from our truck fleet could increase our costs. From another perspective, a carbon constrained environment would likely reward hydrocarbons produced from low cost areas. 
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the United States Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. Among other things, these laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including into navigable waters as well as the protection of drinking water sources. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA”, which amended the CWA and applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
State Environmental Regulations
Our operations involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits. In Texas, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Texas Railroad Commission (the “RRC”) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including those designed to protect the environment and monitor compliance with water quality. In Louisiana, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as to environmental and water quality issues, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission as to allocation of intrastate routes and territories for waste water transportation. In Pennsylvania, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Pennsylvania Public Service Commission. In Ohio, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. In North Dakota, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the North Dakota Department of Health, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, Oil and Gas Division, and the North Dakota State Water Commission. In Montana, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the Montana Board of Oil and Gas.

Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Saltwater Disposal Wells
We operate saltwater disposal wells that are subject to the CWA, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or “SDWA,” and state and local laws and regulations, including those established by the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) Program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or “EPA,” which establishes minimum requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities. Our saltwater disposal wells are located in Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio and Texas. Regulations in many states require us to obtain a permit to operate each of our saltwater disposal wells in those states. These regulatory agencies have the general authority to suspend or modify one or more of these permits if continued operation of one of our saltwater wells is likely to result in pollution of freshwater, tremors or earthquakes, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, or leaks to the environment. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the saltwater wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and claims by third parties for property damages and personal injuries.
Transportation Regulations
We conduct interstate motor carrier (trucking) operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or “FMCSA,” a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, or “USDOT.” The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service, referred to as “HOS.” The agency also performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration (licensing), insurance, and extension of credit to motor carriers’ customers. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, or “hazmat.” The waste water and other water flows we transport by truck are generally not regulated as hazmat at this time.
Our intrastate trucking operations are also subject to various states environmental and waste water transportation regulations discussed under “Environmental Regulations” above. Federal law also allows states to impose insurance and safety requirements on motor carriers conducting intrastate business within their borders, and to collect a variety of taxes and fees on an apportioned basis reflecting miles actually operated within each state.
HOS regulations establish the maximum number of hours that a commercial truck driver may work and are intended to reduce the risk of fatigue and fatigue-related crashes and harm to driver health. Due to the specialized nature of our operations in the oil and gas industry, we qualify for an exception in the federal HOS rules (i.e., the “Oilfield Exemption”). Drivers of most property-carrying commercial motor vehicles have to take at least 34 hours off duty in order to reset their accumulated hours under the 60/70-hour rule, but drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles that are used exclusively to support oil and gas activities can restart with just 24 hours off under the Oilfield Exemption. However, there are other HOS regulations that affect our operations, including the 11-Hour Driving Limit, 14-Hour On Duty Limit, 30-Minute Rest Break, 60/70-Hour Limit On Duty in 7/8 consecutive days. Compliance with these rules directly impacts our operating costs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 700 full time employees, of whom 265 were executive, managerial, sales, general, administrative, and accounting staff, and 435 were truck drivers, service providers and field workers. We have not experienced, and do not expect, any work stoppages, and believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees.
Emergence from Chapter 11 Reorganization
On May 1, 2017, the Company and certain of its material subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the “Nuverra Parties”) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) to pursue prepackaged plans of reorganization (together, and as amended, the “Plan”). On July 25, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Plan. The Plan became effective on August 7, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), when all remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived. On June 22, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued a final decree and order 
10

closing the chapter 11 cases, subject to certain conditions as set forth therein. See Note 25 on “Emergence from Chapter 11 Reorganization” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional details. 
Upon emergence, we elected to apply fresh start accounting effective July 31, 2017, to coincide with the timing of our normal accounting period close. Refer to Note 26 on “Fresh Start Accounting” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional information on the selection of this date. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, a new entity for financial reporting purposes was created, and as such, the condensed consolidated financial statements on or after August 1, 2017, are not comparable with the condensed consolidated financial statements prior to that date. 
References to “Successor” or “Successor Company” refer to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017. References to “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on and prior to July 31, 2017.
