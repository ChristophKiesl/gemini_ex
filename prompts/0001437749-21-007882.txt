Item 1.     Business
Overview
 
We are an alternative asset management firm offering yield solutions to retail and institutional investors. We focus on credit-related investment strategies, primarily originating senior secured loans to private middle market companies in the United States that have revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. We generally hold these loans to maturity. For over 19 years, we have provided capital to over 450 companies across 35 industries in North America.
 
We manage one permanent capital vehicle, which is a BDC, as well as long-dated private funds and SMAs, with a primary focus on senior secured credit. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.9 billion of AUM in a BDC, SIC, as well as private investment vehicles. Our compounded annual AUM growth rate from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2020 was 11%, and our compounded annual fee earning AUM growth rate was 4%, which have both been driven in large part by the growth in our permanent capital vehicle. Typically the investment periods of our institutional commitments range from 18 to 24 months and we expect our fee earning AUM to increase as capital commitments included in AUM are invested.
 
In general, our institutional investors do not have the right to withdraw capital commitments and to date we have not experienced any withdrawals of capital commitments. For a description of the risk factor associated with capital commitments, see “Risk Factors — Third-party investors in our private funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.”
 
The diagram below presents the historical correlation between growth in our AUM, fee earning AUM and management fees.
 
  

(1) Presented on a standalone basis
 
Credit structuring and active monitoring of the loan portfolios we manage are important success factors in our business, which can be adversely affected by difficult market and political conditions, such as the turmoil in the global capital markets from 2007 to 2009 and the ongoing after-effects including market turbulence and volatility. We strive to adhere to a disciplined investment process that employs these principles with the goal of delivering strong risk-adjusted investment returns while protecting investor capital. Our focus on protecting investor capital is reflected in our investment strategy; at December 31, 2020, approximately 73% of the combined portfolios investments were in first lien positions. We believe that our ability to directly originate, structure and lead deals enables us to consistently lend at higher yields with better terms. In addition, the loans we manage generally have a contractual maturity between three and seven years and are typically floating rate (at December 31, 2020, approximately 79% of the loans we manage, based on aggregate principal amount, bore interest at floating rates), which we believe positions our business well for rising interest rates.

Our senior management team has on average over 20 years of experience in credit, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 40 employees, including approximately 20 investment, origination and credit management professionals, and approximately 20 operations, accounting, legal, compliance and marketing professionals, each with extensive experience in their respective disciplines.
 
Voluntary Filing Under Chapter 11 and Going Concern
 
  On March 7, 2021 (the “Petition Date”), Medley LLC commenced the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, a voluntary case under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case is captioned In re: Medley LLC, Case No. 21-10526 (KBO). Medley LLC is the only entity that has filed for Chapter 11 protection, MDLY and the other affiliated adviser entities are not filing any bankruptcy petitions. Medley LLC will continue to operate its business as “debtor-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. To ensure its ability to continue operating in the ordinary course of business, Medley LLC has filed with the Bankruptcy Court motions seeking a variety of “first day” relief, including authority to continue utilizing and maintaining its existing cash management system.
 
In connection with the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case, Medley LLC filed with the Bankruptcy Court the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization and a proposed Disclosure Statement related thereto (the “Disclosure Statement”). Medley LLC intends to seek the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of the Disclosure Statement and confirmation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. There can be no assurances that Medley LLC will obtain the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of the Disclosure Statement and/or confirmation of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, or that if such plan is approved, that the reorganization of Medley LLC will be successfully implemented as contemplated by the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization. This Current Report on Form 10-K is not a solicitation of votes to accept or reject the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization or an offer to sell or exchange securities of Medley LLC or MDLY. Any solicitation of votes or offer to sell or exchange or solicitation of an offer to buy or exchange any securities of Medley LLC or MDLY will be made only pursuant to and in accordance with the Disclosure Statement following approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Capitalized terms used in this Form 10-K under this heading titled “Medley LLC Proposed Plan of Reorganization” but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings given to such terms in the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization.
 
Below is a summary of the treatment that the following stakeholders of Medley LLC would receive under the Medley LLC Plan of reorganization, which is subject to confirmation of the Bankruptcy Court and certain condition precedent:
 

• | Secured Claims. Each holder of an Allowed Secured Claim shall receive, at the option of the Debtor and in its sole discretion: (i) payment in full in Cash of its Allowed Secured Claim; (ii) the collateral securing its Allowed Secured Claim; (iii) Reinstatement of its Allowed Secured Claim; or (iv) such other treatment rendering its Allowed Secured Claim Unimpaired in accordance with section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Priority Claims. Each holder of an Allowed Other Priority Claim shall receive treatment in a manner consistent with section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code. 
• | Notes Claims. On the Effective Date, each holder of an Allowed Notes Claim shall receive: (i) if such holder votes to accept the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, 0.600 shares of newly-issued Class A Common Stock of MDLY for each $25 principal amount of 2024 Notes and/or 2026 Notes held by such holder; (ii) if such holder does not take any action and does not vote on the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, 0.450 shares of newly-issued Class A Common Stock of MDLY for each $25 principal amount of 2024 Notes and/or 2026 Notes held by such holder; or (iii) if such holder elects to Opt-Out of the Third Party Release contained in Article VIII of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization and/or votes to reject the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization, the lesser of (x) 0.134 shares of newly-issued Class A Common Stock of MDLY for each $25 principal amount of 2024 Notes and/or 2026 Notes held by such holder or (y) a pro rata share of the Rejecting Noteholder Pool. 
• | Strategic Claim. The holder of the Allowed Strategic Claim shall receive: (i) 218,182 shares of newly-issued Class A Common Stock of MDLY; (ii) $350,000 in Cash on the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter; and (iii) a secured promissory note, the form of which will be negotiated between the parties prior to the Confirmation Hearing, which provides for 10 consecutive quarterly payments of $225,000 in Cash, commencing on the last Business Day of the first full calendar quarter following the Effective Date. 
• | General Unsecured Claims. Each holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim shall receive, at the option of the Debtor: (i) the lesser of the amount of its Allowed General Unsecured Claim in Cash, or its pro rata share of the General Unsecured Claims Pool; or (ii) Reinstatement. 
• | Intercompany Claims. Each Allowed Intercompany Claim shall be, at the option of the Debtor, either: (i) Reinstated; or (ii) canceled, released, and extinguished and without any distribution at the Debtor’s election and in its sole discretion. 
• | Interests. Each holder of an Interest shall retain such Interest. 

 

The above description of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the plan. Copies of the Medley LLC Plan of Reorganization and the Disclosure Statement have been filed in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Form 10-K.
 
There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with our bankruptcy, including, among others that: (a) our prearranged plan of reorganization may never be confirmed or become effective, (b) the Bankruptcy Court may grant or deny motions in a manner that is adverse to Medley LLC, and (c) the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case may be converted into a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the transactions described therein will be consummated. As a result, we have concluded that management’s plans at this stage do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Although management believes that our reorganization through the Chapter 11 proceedings will appropriately position us upon emergence, the commencement of these proceedings constituted an event of default that accelerates the obligations under the Company's senior unsecured debt. Any efforts to enforce payment obligations under the senior unsecured debt are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Medley LLC Chapter 11 Case and the holders’ rights of enforcement with respect to the senior unsecured debt are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

Our Funds
 
We provide our credit-focused investment strategies through various funds and products that meet the needs of a wide range of retail and institutional investors.
 
Except as otherwise described herein with respect to our BDC, our investment funds themselves do not register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), in reliance on Section 3(c)(1), Section 3(c)(7) or Section 7(d) thereof. Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act exempts from the Investment Company Act’s registration requirements investment funds privately placed in the United States whose securities are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are “qualified purchasers” as defined under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act exempts from the Investment Company Act’s registration requirements privately placed investment funds whose securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons. In addition, under certain current interpretations of the SEC, Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act exempts from registration any non-U.S. investment fund all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned either by non-U.S. residents or by U.S. residents that are qualified purchasers and purchase their interests in a private placement. Certain subsidiaries of Medley LLC typically serve as an investment adviser for our funds and are registered under the Advisors Act. Our funds’ investment advisers or one of their affiliates are entitled to management fees, performance fees and/or incentive fees from each investment fund to which they serve as investment advisers. For a discussion of the fees to which our funds’ investment advisers are entitled across our various types of funds, please see “Business — Fee Structure.”
 
Sierra Income Corporation
 
We launched SIC, our first public non-traded permanent capital vehicle, in 2012 as a BDC. As of December 31, 2020, AUM has grown to $0.7 billion, and which reflects a 61% compounded annual growth rate of AUM from inception through December 31, 2020.
Medley Capital Corporation
 
We launched MCC (NYSE:MCC), our first permanent capital vehicle, in 2011 as a BDC. MCC grew to become a BDC with approximately $0.2 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2020. MCC demonstrated a less than 1% compounded annual growth rate of AUM from inception through December 31, 2020. On November 18, 2020, the board of directors of MCC approved the adoption of an internalized management structure for MCC effective January 1, 2021. As a result of the implementation of MCC’s new management structure, the Investment Management and Administration Agreements between MCC Advisors LLC and MCC expired in accordance with their respective terms on December 31, 2020. When referring to our aggregate AUM and fee earning AUM as of December 31, 2020, such amounts exclude the AUM and fee earning AUM of MCC as of December 31, 2020 as we no longer manage such assets effective January 1, 2021 and no longer earn fees on such assets.
Long-Dated Private Funds
 
We launched MOF I, our first long-dated private fund, in 2006, MOF II, our second long-dated private fund, in 2010, MOF III, our third long-dated private fund, in 2014, MCOF and Aspect, our fourth and fifth long-dated private funds, respectively, in 2016, and MOF III Offshore, our sixth long-dated private fund, in 2017. In 2019, we launched Aspect B. Our long-dated private funds are managed through partnership structures, in which limited partnerships organized by us accept commitments or funds for investment from institutional investors and high net worth individuals, and a general partner makes all policy and investment decisions, including selection of investment advisers. Affiliates of Medley LLC serve as the general partners and investment advisers to our long-dated private funds. The limited partners of our long-dated private funds take no part in the conduct or control of the business of such funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind such funds and have no influence on the voting or disposition of the securities or assets held by such funds, although limited partners often have the right to remove the general partner or cause an early liquidation by super-majority vote. As our long-dated private funds are closed-ended, once an investor makes an investment, the investor is generally not able to withdraw or redeem its interest, except in very limited circumstances.

Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)
 
We launched our first SMA in 2010 and currently manage twelve SMAs. In the case of our SMAs, the investor, rather than us, dictates the risk tolerances and target returns of the account. We act as an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act for these accounts. The accounts offer customized solutions for liability driven investors such as insurance companies and typically offer attractive returns on risk based capital.
Fee Structure
 
We earn management fees at an annual rate ranging from 0.75% to 2.00% and may earn performance fees, which may be in the form of an incentive fee or carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund or SMA. Management fees are generally based on a defined percentage of (1) average or total gross assets, including assets acquired with leverage, (2) total commitments, (3) net invested capital (4) NAV, or (5) lower of cost or market value of a fund’s portfolio investments. Management fees are calculated quarterly and are paid in cash in advance or in arrears depending on each specific fund or SMA. We may earn incentive fees on our permanent capital vehicle and earn incentive fees on certain of our long-dated private funds. In addition, we may earn additional carried interest performance fees on our long-dated private funds and SMAs that are typically 15% to 20% of the total return over a 6% to 8% annualized preferred return.
Sierra Income Corporation
 
Pursuant to the investment management agreement between SIC and our affiliate, SIC Advisors LLC, SIC Advisors LLC receives a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee. The SIC base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of SIC’s gross assets at the end of each completed calendar quarter and is payable quarterly in arrears.
 
The two components of the SIC incentive fee are as follows.
 

• | The first, the Part I incentive fee (which is also referred to as a subordinated incentive fee), payable quarterly in arrears, is 20.0% of SIC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter subject to a 1.75% (which is 7.0% annualized) hurdle rate and a “catch-up” provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under the hurdle rate and catch-up provisions, in any calendar quarter, SIC Advisors LLC receives no incentive fee until SIC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income equals the hurdle rate of 1.75%, but then receives, as a “catch-up,” 100% of SIC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875%. The effect of this provision is that, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter, SIC Advisors LLC will receive 20.0% of SIC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, due diligence and consulting fees or other fees that SIC receives from portfolio companies accrued during the calendar quarter, minus SIC’s operating expenses for the quarter including the base management fee, expenses payable to SIC Advisors LLC or to us, and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that SIC has not yet received in cash. Since the hurdle rate is fixed, if interest rates rise, it will be easier for us to surpass the hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The second, the Part II incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment management agreement as of the termination date), and equals 20.0% of SIC’s cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to SIC Advisors LLC.

 
Strategic Capital Advisory Services, LLC ("SCAS") owned 20% of SIC Advisors LLC through July 31, 2018 and was entitled to receive distributions of up to 20% of the gross cash proceeds received by SIC Advisors LLC from the management and incentive fees paid by SIC to SIC Advisors LLC, net of certain expenses, as well as 20% of the returns of the investments held at SIC Advisors LLC. In December 2018, Medley LLC entered into a Letter Agreement with SCAS (the “Letter Agreement”), whereby consideration of $14.0 million was agreed upon for the satisfaction in full of all amounts owed by SIC Advisors under the LLC Agreement of SIC Advisors. The amount due was payable in sixteen equal installments through August 5, 2022. As a result of the ongoing economic impact of COVID-19, Medley LLC did not pay its installment payment that was due in May 2020 and commenced discussions with SCAS to seek deferral of a portion of the upcoming installment payments until 2021 through 2023. On August 4, 2020, MDLY and SCAS entered into an amendment to the Letter Agreement which, among other items, revised the payment terms under the original letter agreement. The payment terms were amended such that the remaining balance due to SCAS would be payable as follows: $700,000 on August 5, 2020, followed by three quarterly installments of $350,000 and quarterly installments thereafter of $1.0 million through February 5, 2023.
 

 Medley Capital Corporation


 Pursuant to the investment management agreement between MCC and our affiliate, MCC Advisors LLC, MCC Advisors LLC received a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee. Effective January 1, 2016, pursuant to a fee waiver executed by MCC Advisors LLC on February 8, 2016, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of MCC’s gross assets up to $1.0 billion and 1.50% on MCC's gross assets over $1.0 billion, and was payable quarterly in arrears (the “Reduced Base Management Fee”). The Reduced Base Management Fee was calculated based on the average value of MCC’s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and was appropriately pro-rated for any partial quarter. Prior to January 1, 2016, the MCC base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of MCC's gross assets. The base management fee was calculated based on the average value of MCC's gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.



 On June 12, 2020, the Company and MCC entered into an Expense Support Agreement (the “ESA”) under which the Company agreed to cap the MCC management fee and all of MCC's other operating expenses (except interest expense, certain extraordinary strategic transaction expenses, and other expenses approved by the MCC Special Committee) at $667,000 per month (the “Cap”). Under the ESA, the Cap was effective from June 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $0.7 million for ESA expenses under this agreement. As a result of MCC's adoption of an internalized structure effective January 1, 2020, the Investment Management Agreement between MCC Advisors LLC and MCC expired in accordance with their respective terms on December 31, 2020 and we no longer earn fees on these assets.

Long-Dated Private Funds and SMAs
 
Pursuant to the respective underlying agreements of our long-dated private funds and SMAs, we receive an annual management fee and may earn incentive or performance fees. In general, management fees are calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% to 2.00% calculated on the value of the capital accounts or the value of the investments held by each limited partner, fund or account. We may also receive transaction and advisory fees from a funds' underlying portfolio investment. In certain circumstances, we are required to offset our management fees earned by 50% to 100% of transaction and advisory fees earned. In addition, we receive performance fees or carried interest in an amount equal to 15.0% to 20.0% of the realized cash derived from an investment, subject to a cumulative annualized preferred return to the investor of 6.0% to 8.0%, which is in turn subject to a 50% to 100% catch-up allocation to us.
 
For certain long-dated private funds, we may also earn a two-part incentive fee. The first, the Part I incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in an amount equal to 15.0% to 20.0% of the net investment income, subject to a hurdle rate equal to 1.5% to 2.0% per quarter, which is in turn subject to a 50% to 100% catch-up provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. The second, the Part II incentive fee, is calculated and payable annually in an amount equal to 15.0% to 20.0% of cumulative realized capital gains.
 
In order to align the interests of our senior professionals and the other individuals who manage our long-dated private funds with our own interests and with those of the investors in such funds, such individuals may be allocated directly a portion of the performance fees in such funds. These interests entitle the holders to share the performance fees earned from MOF II. We may make similar arrangements with respect to allocation of performance or incentive fees with respect to MOF III, MCOF, Aspect or other long-dated private funds that we may advise in the future.
 
As noted above, in connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.”
 
Investor Relations
 
Our fundraising efforts historically have been spread across distribution channels and have not been dependent on the success of any single channel. We distribute our investment products through two primary channels: (1) our permanent capital vehicle and (2) long-dated private funds and SMAs. We believe that each of these channels offers unique advantages to investors and allows us to continue to raise and deploy capital opportunistically in varying market environments.
 
   4

 

Permanent Capital Vehicle
 
We distribute our permanent capital vehicle through one sub-channel:
 

• | SIC is our only non-traded public vehicle. It offers retail and institutional investors access to an otherwise illiquid asset class (middle market credit) without exposure to public market trading volatility. It allows us to continue to raise capital continually during more challenging operating environments when publicly listed vehicles may be trading below net asset value (“NAV”), which we believe is valuable during times of market volatility. We believe this is a competitive advantage allowing us to make opportunistic investments, while peers may be more limited during times of market volatility.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Prior to April 6, 2020, STRF was an additional sub-channel to distribute permanent capital vehicle. STRF was our non-traded interval vehicle. It offered retail and institutional investors investments in the debt and equity of fixed-income and fixed-income related securities. STRF was a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end investment management company that was operated as an interval fund. We no longer distribute or aggregate fees of STRF as of April 6, 2020.
 
Long-Dated Private Funds and SMAs
 
We distribute our long-dated private funds and SMAs through two sub-channels:
 

• | Long-dated private funds: Our long-dated private funds offer institutional investors attractive risk-adjusted returns. We believe this channel is an important element of our capital raising efforts given institutional investors are more likely to remain engaged in higher yielding private credit assets during periods of market turbulence.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Separately managed accounts: Our SMAs provide investors with customized investment solutions. This is particularly attractive for liability driven investors such as insurance companies that invest over long time horizons.

 
We believe that our deep and long-standing investor relationships, founded on our strong performance, disciplined management of our investors’ capital and diverse product offering, have facilitated the growth of our existing business and will assist us with the development of additional strategies and products, thereby increasing our fee earning AUM in the future. We have dedicated in-house capital markets, investor relations and marketing specialists. We have frequent discussions with our investors and are committed to providing them with the highest quality service. We believe our service levels, as well as our emphasis on transparency, inspire loyalty and support our efforts to continue to attract investors across our investment platform.
 
Investment Process
 
Disciplined Underwriting. We perform thorough due diligence and focus on several key criteria in our underwriting process, including strong underlying business fundamentals, a meaningful equity cushion, experienced management, conservative valuation and the ability to deleverage through cash flows. We are often the agent for the loans we originate and accordingly influence the loan documentation and negotiation of covenants, which allows us to maintain consistent underwriting standards. We invest across a broad range of industries and our disciplined underwriting process often involves engagement of industry experts and third-party consultants. This disciplined underwriting process is essential, as our funds have historically invested primarily in privately held companies, for which public financial information may be unavailable. Since our inception, we have experienced annualized realized losses for 0.8% of that capital through December 31, 2020. We believe our disciplined underwriting culture is a key factor to our success and our ability to expand our product offerings.

Prior to making an investment, the investment team subjects each potential borrower to an extensive credit review process, which typically begins with an analysis of the market opportunity, business fundamentals, company operating metrics and historical and projected financial analysis. We also analyze liquidity, operating margin trends, leverage, free cash flow and fixed charge coverage ratios for potential investments. Areas of additional underwriting focus include management or sponsor (typically a private equity firm) experience, management compensation, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, pricing power, defensibility of market share and tangible asset values. Background checks may be conducted and tax compliance information may be requested on management teams and key employees. In addition, the investment team may contact customers, suppliers and competitors and/or perform on-site visits as part of a routine business due diligence process.
 
The investment team routinely uses third-party consultants and market studies to corroborate valuation and industry specific due diligence, as well as provide quality of earnings analysis. Experienced legal counsel is engaged to evaluate and mitigate regulatory, insurance, tax or other company-specific risks.
 
After the investment team completes its final due diligence, each proposed investment is presented to our investment committee and subjected to extensive discussion and follow-up analysis, if necessary. A formal memorandum for each investment opportunity typically includes the results of business due diligence, multi-scenario financial analysis, risk-management assessment, results of third-party consulting work, background checks (where applicable) and structuring proposals. Our investment committee requires a majority vote to approve any investment.
 
Active Credit Management. We employ active credit management. Our process includes frequent interaction with management, monthly or quarterly reviews of financial information and, may include attendance at board of directors’ meetings as observers. Investment professionals with deep restructuring and workout experience support our credit management effort. The investment team also evaluates financial reporting packages provided by portfolio companies that detail operational and financial performance. Data is entered in Mariana Systems, an investment management software program. Mariana Systems creates a centralized, dynamic electronic repository for all of our portfolio company data and generates comprehensive, standardized reports and dashboards, which aggregate operational updates, portfolio company financial performance, asset valuations, macro trends, management call notes and account history.
Identification and Sourcing. Our experience and reputation have allowed us to generate what we believe to be a substantial and continuous flow of attractive investment opportunities. We source investment opportunities primarily through financial sponsors, as well as through direct relationships with companies, financial intermediaries such as national, regional and local bankers, accountants, lawyers and consultants. Historically, as much as half of our annual origination volume has been derived from either repeat or referred borrowers or repeat sponsors. The other half of our annual origination volume has been sourced through a variety of channels including direct relationships with companies, financial intermediaries such as national, regional and local bankers, accountants, lawyers and consultants, as well as through other financial sponsors. Medley investments are well diversified across 26 of the 35 industries. As of December 31, 2020, our industry exposures in excess of 10% were 12.3% in business services, 10.4% in healthcare and pharmaceuticals and 10.3% in High Tech Industries. Medley has a highly selective, three step underwriting process that is governed by an investment committee. This comprehensive process narrows down the investment opportunities from generally over 1,000 a year to approximately 1% to 3% originated borrowers in a year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sourced 164 investment opportunities across 55 borrowers and approximately $353 million of invested capital. As of December 31, 2020, our funds had 240 investments across 149 borrowers.
Investment Operations and Information Technology
 
In addition to our investment team, we have a finance, accounting and operations team that supports our public and private vehicles team by providing infrastructure and administrative support in the areas of accounting/finance, valuation, capital markets and treasury functions, operations/information technology, strategy and business development, legal/compliance and human resources.
Regulatory and Compliance Matters
 
Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. The SEC and other regulators around the world have in recent years significantly increased their regulatory activities with respect to alternative asset management firms. Our business is subject to compliance with laws and regulations of United States federal and state governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. Our business has been operated for a number of years within a legal framework that requires our being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability.
 
Certain of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”). Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to advisory clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an advisor and advisory clients and general anti-fraud prohibitions. The SEC requires investment advisers registered or required to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act that advise one or more private funds and have at least $150.0 million in private fund assets under management to periodically file reports on Form PF. We have filed, and will continue to file, quarterly reports on Form PF, which has resulted in increased administrative costs and requires a significant amount of attention and time to be spent by our personnel. In addition, our investment advisers are subject to routine periodic examinations by the staff of the SEC. 
 
SIC is a BDC. A BDC is a special category of investment company under the Investment Company Act that was added by Congress to facilitate the flow of capital to private companies and small public companies based in the United States that do not have efficient or cost-effective access to public capital markets or other conventional forms of corporate financing. BDCs make investments in private or thinly traded public companies in the form of long-term debt and/or equity capital, with the goal of generating current income or capital growth.

BDCs are closed-end funds that elect to be regulated as BDCs under the Investment Company Act. As such, BDCs are subject to only certain provisions of the Investment Company Act, as well as the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. BDCs are provided greater flexibility under the Investment Company Act than are other investment companies that are registered under the Investment Company Act in dealing with their portfolio companies, issuing securities, and compensating their managers. BDCs can be internally or externally managed and may qualify to elect to be taxed as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the regulations thereunder, for federal tax purposes. The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters, and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The Investment Company Act requires that a majority of a BDC’s directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, the Investment Company Act provides that a BDC may not change the nature of its business so as to cease to be, or withdraw its election to be regulated as a BDC unless approved by a majority of its outstanding voting securities. The Investment Company Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of its outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (2) more than 50% of its voting securities.
 
Generally, BDCs are prohibited under the Investment Company Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with their affiliates without the prior approval of their board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the prohibition on transactions with affiliates broadly to prohibit “joint transactions” among entities that share a common investment adviser.
 
On November 25, 2013, we received an amended order from the SEC that expanded our ability to negotiate the terms of co-investment transactions among our BDC and other funds managed by us (the “Exemptive Order”), subject to the conditions included therein. In situations where co-investment with other funds managed by us is not permitted or appropriate, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer or where the different investments could be expected to result in a conflict between our interests and those of our other clients, we will need to decide which client will proceed with the investment. We will make these determinations based on our policies and procedures, which generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on an alternating basis that will be fair and equitable over time. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, our BDC is unable to invest in any issuer in which another of our funds holds an existing investment. Similar restrictions limit our BDC's ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates.
 
Under the terms of the Exemptive Order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the independent directors of our BDC must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the applicable BDC and such BDC’s stockholders and do not involve overreaching of such BDC or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the BDC’s stockholders and is consistent with its investment strategies and policies.
 
Our BDC has elected to be treated as an RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As an RIC, a BDC generally does not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income that is distributed to its stockholders from its tax earnings and profits. To maintain qualification as a RIC, our BDC must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, our BDC must distribute to its stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of its “investment company taxable income,” which is generally its net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes significant regulations on nearly every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including oversight and regulation of systemic market risk (including the power to liquidate certain institutions); authorizing the Federal Reserve to regulate nonbank institutions that are deemed systemically important; generally prohibiting insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of any of these types of entities, regardless of geographic location, from conducting proprietary trading or investing in or sponsoring a “covered fund,” which includes private equity funds and hedge funds (i.e., the Volcker Rule); and imposing new registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on private fund investment advisers.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory authorities to promulgate certain rules relating to the regulation of the derivatives market. Such rules require or will require the registration of certain market participants, the clearing of certain derivatives contracts through central counterparties, the execution of certain derivatives contracts on electronic platforms, as well as reporting and recordkeeping of derivatives transactions. Certain of our funds may from time to time, directly or indirectly, invest in instruments that meet the definition of a “swap” under the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC’s rules promulgated thereunder. As a result, such funds may qualify as commodity pools, and the operators of such funds may need to register as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) unless an exemption applies. Additionally, pursuant to a rule finalized by the CFTC in December 2012, certain classes of interest rate swaps and certain classes of index credit default swaps have also been subject to mandatory clearing, unless an exemption applies. Since February 2014, many of these interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps have also been subject to mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides expanded enforcement authority to the CFTC and SEC. While certain rules have been promulgated and are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is still ongoing. In particular, the CFTC has finalized most of its rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the SEC has proposed several rules regarding security-based swaps but has only finalized a small number of these rules.
 
On September 17, 2019 the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement (the "Staff") informed the Company that it was conducting an informal inquiry and requested the production and preservation of certain documents and records. The Company fully cooperated with the Staff's informal inquiry and began voluntarily providing the Staff with any requested documents. By letter dated December 18, 2019, the Staff advised the Company that a formal order of private investigation (the “Order”) had been issued and that the informal inquiry was now a formal investigation. The Order indicated that the investigation relates to Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Rule 206(4)-8, Sections 13(a) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder. MDLY continues to cooperate fully with the investigation. The Company cannot predict the outcome of, or the timeframe for, the conclusion of this investigation. An adverse outcome could have a material effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 
Competition
 
The investment management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We face competition both in the pursuit of outside investors for our funds and in acquiring investments in attractive investee companies and making other investments. We compete for outside investors based on a variety of factors, including:

• | investment performance;
--+------------------------


• | investor perception of investment managers’ drive, focus and alignment of interest;


• | quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;


• | business reputation; and


• | the level of fees and expenses charged for services.

 
We face competition in our lending and other investment activities primarily from other credit-focused funds, specialized funds, BDCs, real estate funds, hedge fund sponsors, other financial institutions and other parties. Many of these competitors in some of our business are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than are available to us. Many of these competitors have similar investment objectives to us, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make. Lastly, institutional and individual investors are allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies. Several large institutional investors have announced a desire to consolidate their investments in a more limited number of managers. We expect that this will cause competition in our industry to intensify and could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies.
 
Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our business will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 40 individuals, including approximately 20 investment, origination and credit management professionals, located in our New York office.
 
Termination of Agreement and Plan of Merger 
 
On July 29, 2019, MDLY entered into the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019 (the “Amended MDLY Merger Agreement”), by and among MDLY, Sierra Income Corporation (“Sierra”), and Sierra Management, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sierra (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which MDLY would have, along with the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving company in the merger (the “MDLY Merger”). In addition, on July 29, 2019, Medley Capital Corporation (“MCC”) and Sierra entered into the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019 (the “Amended MCC Merger Agreement”), by and between MCC and Sierra, pursuant to which MCC would have, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, merged with and into Sierra, with Sierra as the surviving company in the merger (the “MCC Merger”).
 
On May 1, 2020, the Company received a written notice of termination from Sierra in accordance with Sections 9.1 and 10.2 of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement. Section 9.1(c) of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement permits both MDLY and Sierra to terminate the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement if the MDLY Merger had not been consummated on or before March 31, 2020 (the “Outside Date”).
 
As a result, the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement had been terminated effective as of May 1, 2020. Sierra terminated the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement effective as of May 1, 2020 as the Outside Date had passed and the MDLY Merger had not been consummated. Representatives of Sierra informed MDLY that in determining to terminate the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, Sierra considered a number of factors, including, among other factors, changes in the relative valuation of the Company and Sierra, the changed circumstances and the unpredictable economic conditions resulting from the global health crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the uncertainty regarding the parties’ ability to satisfy the conditions to closing the MDLY Merger in a timely manner.
 
In addition, on May 1, 2020, MCC received a notice of termination from Sierra of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement. Under the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, either party may have, subject to certain conditions, terminated the Amended MCC Merger Agreement if the MCC Merger was not consummated by March 31, 2020. Sierra elected to do so on May 1, 2020. Representatives of Sierra informed MCC that in determining to terminate the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, Sierra considered a number of factors, including, among other factors, changes in the relative valuation of MCC and Sierra, the changed circumstances and the unpredictable economic conditions resulting from the global health crisis caused by
 
Transaction expenses related to the MDLY Merger are included in general, administrative and other expenses and primarily consist of professional fees. Such expenses amounted to $4.7 million, $4.6 million and $3.8 million for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
