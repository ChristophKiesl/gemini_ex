   ITEM 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
  THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS
 
 GrowLife, Inc. (“GrowLife” or the “Company”) is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. We were founded in 2012 with the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT Merger Corporation.
 
  GrowLife persevered through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as the Cannabis industry was classified an essential business by 36 States where it is medicinally legal and 16 States where it is completely legal. Our GrowLife team worked remotely where it could reach out to customers and channels to facilitate sales. Overall market studies reported 35% industry growth in 2020 in spite of COVID-19. However, our revenue declined 15%; the first declining year since 2016. Our revenue reduction of approximately $1.2 million was the result of a $2.9 million reduction in our hydroponics segments partially offset by a $1.7 million increase at EZ-CLONE Enterprises. Like the prior year’s 78% revenue growth, we had expected another revenue growth year in 2020, despite winding down our hydroponics segment. Unfortunately, we experienced continuing supply chain problems with our manufacturing subsidiary wherein they could not keep up with the GrowLife sales orders, resulting in limitation of our fourth quarter EZ-CLONE revenue to $2 million as a result of the backlog. On the positive side, annual gross margins rose from 31.0% to 42.5% year over year and general and administrative expenses were significantly reduced from $7 million to $4.9 million. These aggregated expenses were in spite of our expansion plans and spending into the clone market, which our cloning manufacturer was part of, and we had announced in 2019.
  
  Also previously reported, we did not close the purchase of the remaining 49% of stock of EZ-CLONE that was due on July 15, 2020 and the founders of EZ-CLONE entered into litigation against the Company. Each of our 2020 10-Q filings revealed increasing quarter over quarter backlogs of EZ-CLONE product delivery in response to sales pointing to the manufacturer’s inability to keep up with GrowLife’s increasing sales and customer demand. In the first quarter it was $400,000 of sales backlog that was deferred into the second quarter;in the second quarter we could not recognize $1 million of GrowLife sales because EZ-CLONE supply chain and backlog issues; and finally in the third quarter, only $1.4 million of revenue was recognized and another $2 million of GrowLife sales was backlogged into the 4th quarter because of supply chain and shipment problems. Based on the backlogged orders, we estimate we were unable to recognize the approximately $2 million in revenue.
   
  As we pointed out in the third quarter 10-Q, we recognized the saturation issue in the Hemp CBD market and postponed our entry into the clone/starter business until 2021 which has not subsided. However, as we look at the Cannabis industry, we can make three observations from early 2021: First, the MORE Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives on December 4, 2020, a landmark step toward the federal legalization of Cannabis that can permit interstate commerce and true US companies to touch the plant and trade on the stock exchange; Second, Senate Majority Leader Schumer announced in early April that he will move the legalization bill forward in the US Senate and seek support with the White House to obtain federal legalization; Finally, GrowLife retains its 51% assets in EZ-CLONE, investors are aligned and financially support GrowLife to settle with EZ-CLONE as well as expand in new markets, and our management depth remains in place to grow as opportunities are identified.
  
  Therefore, we see a growing market, intend to service our customers and will continue to seek opportunities in the legal Cannabis industry. We believe this is a great opportunity for our customers, shareholders and one where GrowLife is uniquely positioned to capitalize on. The Company’s goal is to become the nation’s largest cultivation facility service provider focused on propagation systems serving more cultivators with products of high quality, exceptional value and competitive price.

  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
 
 Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $1,217,000 to $7,001,000 from $8,218,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease resulted from our decision to wind down the hydroponics segment in 2020. The elimination of the hydroponics sales personnel and the impact of the pandemic on the hydroponics segment during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulted in hydroponics revenue declining to $1,568,000 in 2020 as compared to $4,487,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The EZ-CLONE revenue from its line of products for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5,433,00 as compared to $3,731,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 Employees
 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 10 full-time and part-time employees. Marco Hegyi, our Chief Executive Officer, is based in Kirkland, Washington. Mark E. Scott, our former Chief Financial Officer, was based primarily in Seattle, Washington. He resigned effective December 31, 2020. Michael E. Fasci was appointed Chief financial Officer on January 1, 2021. We have approximately 9 of our full and part time employees located throughout the United States who operate our businesses. In addition, we employ 13 full-time and part-time employees at EZ-CLONE in Sacramento, CA. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union.
 Key Partners
  
 Our key customers have become the cultivation buyers of cloning systems though out various states and these products are sold through direct, retailers and distributors.  Therefore, our key suppliers include distributors and manufacturers including EZ-CLONE. All the products purchased and resold are applicable to indoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines. 
 Competition
  
 Covering two countries across all cultivator segments creates competitors that also serve as partners.  Large commercial cultivators have found themselves willing to assume their own equipment support by buying large volume purchased directly from certain suppliers and distributors such as Hawthorne and HydroFarm. Other key competitors on the retail side consist of local and regional hydroponic resellers of indoor growing equipment.  On the e-commerce business, GrowersHouse.com, Hydrobuilder.com and smaller online resellers using Amazon and eBay e-commerce market systems. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
  
  Our intellectual property consists of brands and their related trademarks and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product know-how and technology, and marketing intangibles. Our other intellectual property is primarily in the form of trademarks and domain names. We also hold rights to several website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.shopgrowlife.com and www.growlifeinc.com. We have a policy of entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, some of our vendors and customers as necessary.
  
  Acquisition of EZ-CLONE
  
  On October 15, 2018, we closed the Purchase and Sale Agreement with EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc., a California corporation (the “Agreement”).  On November 5, 2019, we amended the Agreement with one 24.5% shareholder of EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc. (“EZ-CLONE”), to extend the date to purchase the remaining 49% of stock of EZ-CLONE in exchange for a 20% extension fee (a total of $171,000 for the 49% or $85,500 for each 24.5% shareholder) of the $855,000 cash payable at the earlier of the closing of $2,000,000 in funding or nine months (July 2020). The Company did not close the purchase of the remaining 49% of stock of EZ-CLONE by the extended deadline.
  
  On September 15, 2020, we received notice that William Blackburn and Brad Mickelsen (“Plaintiffs”), minority shareholders of EZ-CLONE Enterprises, Inc., a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company and its officers Marco Hegyi and Mark Scott (“Officers”), in the Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento (“Complaint”) for claims related to breach under the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated October 15, 2018 between the Company and Plaintiffs. The Complaint also alleges that the Company and its Officers made certain false representations and other claims to consummate the Transaction and as a result has failed to complete the second closing as required under Purchase and Sale Agreement. As of December 4, 2020, the Company’s officers were dismissed from the case. The Plaintiffs are seeking rescission of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, unspecified damages in excess of ten thousand dollars, and other equitable relief.

 On September 15, 2020, we filed a notice of removal with the California Superior Court, County of Sacramento and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.  The case was removed to Federal District Court for the Eastern District of California and Plaintiffs filed an Ex Parte Application for TRO and an Order for Preliminary Injunction with the Federal Court.  The TRO was granted on September 16, 2020 and a preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for September 29, 2020.  After reviewing all pleadings and oral arguments at the hearing, the Court issued a ruling granting Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.  Presently the parties are providing legal briefs to the Federal court to determine if rescission should be granted. 
  
 As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a liability of $2,131,000 for acquisition payable of which a $1,105,000 is payable in stock and $1,026,000 is payable in cash.
 
  Government Regulation
 
 Currently, there are thirty six states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. There are currently sixteen states and the District of Columbia that allow recreational use of cannabis. As of December 31, 2020, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of customers of GrowLife to invest in or buy products from GrowLife. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the GrowLife companies.
 
 All this being said, many reports show that the majority of the American public is in favor of making medical cannabis available as a controlled substance to those patients who need it. The need and consumption will then require cultivators to continue to provide safe and compliant crops to consumers. The cultivators will then need to build facilities and use consumable products, which GrowLife provides.
  
  OUR COMMON STOCK
  
  As of March 4, 2019, we began to trade on the Pink Sheet stocks system. Our bid price had closed below $0.01 for more than 30 consecutive calendar days. As of March 17, 2020, we commenced trading on the OTCQB Market ("OTCQB") after successfully up-listing from the OTC Pink Market.
