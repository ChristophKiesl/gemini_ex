GENERAL
Background
Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. (referred to, with its consolidated subsidiaries, as "we," "us," "our," the "Company," "SWM INTL" or "SWM" unless the context indicates otherwise) is a multinational producer of performance materials, including papers, nets and films headquartered in the United States of America (the "U.S."). The Company operates under two reportable segments: Advanced Materials & Structures ("AMS"), which manufactures resin-based products used in specialty applications in the filtration, transportation, infrastructure and construction, medical and industrial end-markets, and Engineered Papers ("EP"), which produces cigarette papers and reconstituted tobacco products for cigarette and cigar manufacturers, as well as various other non-tobacco paper products.
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark"). On November 30, 1995, Kimberly-Clark transferred its tobacco-related paper and other paper products businesses conducted in the U.S., France and Canada to the Company and distributed all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to its stockholders (the "spin-off"). As a result, the Company became an independent public company. We conduct business in over 90 countries and operate 23 production locations worldwide, with facilities in the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada, France, Luxembourg, Russia, Brazil, China, Belgium and Poland.
Our principal executive office is located at 100 North Point Center East, Suite 600, Alpharetta, Georgia 30022-8246 and our telephone number is (800) 514-0186. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "SWM."
Strategic Overview
Through 2013, the Company operated as a tobacco-centric paper operation. In late 2012, SWM's management and Board of Directors elected to pursue a strategic transformation by increasing profit streams outside the tobacco industry through business acquisitions, while carefully managing the profitable but mature tobacco operations. Over time, this strategy was intended to counterbalance the expected long-term pressures of the tobacco industry and transform SWM into a more diversified and growth-oriented enterprise while maintaining its company-wide focus on several underlying themes: manufacturing and innovation expertise in performance materials, operational excellence, and customer intimacy. The Company selectively targeted acquisition candidates that served diversified and growing end-markets, generated profitability associated with premium differentiated products, and had leading and defensible competitive positions in their core product categories. In addition, management believed many acquisition targets would have unique synergy opportunities when combined with the assets and capabilities of SWM, such as a global infrastructure and a robust operational excellence program, and ultimately, synergies with other similar companies acquired by SWM. 
Pursuant to this strategy, management has used free cash flow and liquidity available through our credit facility to support growth investments. From 2013 to 2020 the Company acquired four primary businesses, DelStar, Argotec, Conwed and Tekra, LLC and Trient ("Tekra"), and also made two “bolt-on” acquisitions. These businesses together now comprise the AMS segment, which generated more than $540.0 million in net sales in 2020. The combination of AMS with non-tobacco sales in our paper business, resulted in total non-tobacco sales representing 56% of the Company’s total revenue in 2020, up from approximately 6% prior to these strategic actions. While the AMS segment provides positive cash flow, the EP segment generates the majority of the Company's cash flow, supporting SWM’s acquisition strategy and dividends to shareholders.
The AMS Growth Platform
In December 2013, the Company acquired DelStar, Inc. ("DelStar"), a manufacturer of resin-based nets, films and non-wovens, focused on the filtration, medical, and industrial end-markets. DelStar established SWM's presence in new industries and added a portfolio of high-value technologies. Management also believed DelStar could benefit from SWM's global footprint, operational excellence program, and ability to fund growth investments. 
In October 2015, the Company acquired Argotec Intermediate Holdings LLC ("Argotec"), a manufacturer of urethane films for applications primarily in the transportation end-market. A key growth driver was increasing demand for surface protection films used for automotive paint protection and glass lamination. This business also serves customers in the medical and industrial end-markets. From a technology standpoint, Argotec added to SWM's growing resin extrusion capabilities and added scale to the AMS growth platform.
In January 2017, SWM acquired Conwed Plastics LLC (“Conwed”), a producer of resin-based netting. Conwed’s similarities to the Company’s existing netting production assets presented a compelling opportunity to drive synergies through footprint rationalization, procurement, and organizational realignment. Although operationally similar to AMS’ existing assets, Conwed added further end-market diversification, with approximately 75% of Conwed’s sales serving the infrastructure and construction end-markets. The remaining 25% of sales were split between filtration and industrial end-markets, which also complemented the existing AMS business. 
On March 13, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Tekra, a converter of high-performance films and substrates which added coating and converting capabilities, increased the Company’s medical business, and provided further penetration into transportation and industrial end-markets.
The acquisitions described above comprise the AMS segment. The Company believes that these businesses advance SWM's goal of diversifying its revenue stream and offer long-term growth opportunities across a broad set of attractive end-markets.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Segment Financial Information. We operate and manage two reportable segments based on our product lines: AMS and EP. The AMS segment manufactures resin-based products used in specialty applications in the filtration, transportation, infrastructure and construction, medical, and industrial end-markets. This segment is comprised of the six businesses we acquired from 2013 to 2020: DelStar, the Pronamic and Smith & Nephew ("SNN") acquisitions, Argotec, Conwed and Tekra, which the Company has integrated into a more holistically aligned operating segment. Our Engineered Papers segment produces both tobacco-related papers and non-tobacco-related papers. Our tobacco-related papers, which comprise a large majority of EP's sales, include various papers used in cigarette production and reconstituted tobacco ("Recon"), a reprocessed tobacco material. 
Additional information regarding "Segment Performance" is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, selected financial data for our segments is available in Note 21. Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and a discussion regarding the risks associated with foreign operations is available in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 
Financial information about foreign and domestic operations, contained under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" appearing in Part II, Item 7 herein and in Notes 13, 14, 17 and 21 ("Restructuring and Impairment Activities," "Debt," "Income Taxes" and "Segment Information," respectively) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in Part II, Item 8 herein, is incorporated by reference in this Item 1.
Advanced Materials & Structures
Products. We manufacture and sell a variety of highly engineered resin-based nets, films, and other non-wovens. These performance materials are often used in growing applications serving the filtration, transportation, infrastructure and construction, medical, and industrial end-markets. Most of our production technologies are extrusion-based, meaning resin pellets are heated, softened, and forced through a metal die to form continuous sheets or strands. We have significant technological expertise in proprietary die construction, which our competitors often outsource, and we consider this an advantage in protecting our technology and competitive position. 
Our thermoplastic nets are used in a variety of applications, the most prominent of which is their use as spacer netting in reverse osmosis water filtration (“RO filtration") devices. We have established a strong presence in this application by customizing products to meet demanding customer specifications, such as thickness/weight, flow characteristics, and heat and pressure resistance. Our nets are also used in a variety of other filtration applications such as fuel and hydraulic fluid filters, pharmaceutical filters, and food and beverage filters. Another key netting application is erosion and sediment control products for the infrastructure and construction end-markets. Our nets are the outside layers in erosion control blankets, which are used to prevent erosion on sloped terrain. We also produce sediment control “socks” that are used to set perimeters around various development sites to contain sediment and prevent contamination of water sources. Our nets can also be found in a variety of industrial applications such as carpet cushion support and retail food packaging.
We manufacture our thermoplastic polyurethane films ("TPU") to have combinations of the following attributes; UV, scratch and water resistance and ultra-clarity. The ability to demonstrate these rare combinations make them ideally suited for demanding transportation-related surface protection applications, primarily automotive paint protection and security reinforced glass. These products are also used in certain niche applications such as graphics and laminated textiles in the industrial end-market, and also in the medical end-market. Other films, including apertured film products, are used in wound care applications, such as finger bandages and wound dressings for the medical end-market and are also used in specialty liquid filters for ultra-pure semiconductor manufacturing processes. The acquisition of Tekra added coating and converting capabilities which are often used in production of films or other substrates, including medical diagnostic test strips and high-end printed graphic materials. 
Our non-wovens are typically air-laid resin-based materials often used in liquid filtration and residential and commercial air filtration. In addition to rolled goods, SWM also manufactures rigid core tubing, an extruded resin 
product that also is primarily used in reverse osmosis water filtration devices, and flexible tubing used in various medical and industrial applications.
With the growth of our AMS division, our technical expertise around the production, coating, and converting of resin-based materials is increasing. We believe we have industry-leading innovation capabilities and an expanding product portfolio which we expect to support growth through collaborative product development opportunities with our customers.
Markets and Customers. The AMS segment supplies customers serving the filtration, transportation, infrastructure and construction, medical, and industrial end-markets. Generally, the applications and customers the AMS segment serves are in growing end-markets, and as a percentage of total AMS segment sales are as follows: filtration - 24%, transportation - 22%, infrastructure and construction - 23%, medical - 14%, industrial - 17%. These products are highly engineered and often customized. In some cases, we are the sole supplier of certain products to our top customers, though no customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. 
Within the filtration end-market, reverse osmosis water filtration has exhibited historical long-term growth due to increasing global demand for drinkable water and we expect global infrastructure investments in this area to continue long-term. Our other filtration products are often used in the food and beverage industries and heavy equipment and machinery used in the oil and gas industries, filtering fuel and other hydraulic liquids, as well as serving other functions in the exploration, processing, and transport of oil, gas, and metals. We refer to non-RO liquid filtration products generally as process filtration. While sales of process filtration products, particularly those used in the oil, gas, and mining sectors, can be subject to cyclicality and commodity price volatility, we expect strong long-term demand across the product line. In addition to liquid filtration products, the company also produces media and support materials for air filtration devices used in commercial and residential HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning).
The majority of our TPU films are used in transportation-related surface protection applications, specifically automotive paint protection. This product is typically sold and installed in the after-market through dealerships or auto body shops. Recently, we have benefited from global adoption of paint protection films, particularly in Asia. Other surface protection applications, such as ballistic-resistant and security glass used primarily on vehicles can be impacted by government and military contracts. 
Our sales to the infrastructure and construction end-market are largely comprised of erosion/sediment control products. Our netting is used in the production of erosion control blankets, which are used mostly in domestic highway development projects to cover roadside slopes during and after construction. We also offer customers a unique sediment control solution, a filled “sock”, used to seal perimeters of development sites and prevent the seepage of harmful contaminants. This product has gained adoption in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In the construction segment, our netting products are used as support material for carpet cushion, construction materials protection, and support backing for sod production. We also produce films used in commercial architectural glass.
Our medical film products largely serve the wound care management and diagnostic test strip niches within the medical end-market and industrial applications are spread across a variety of other industries, such as packaging, apparel, food manufacturing, print graphics and energy. 
Sales and Distribution. AMS products are primarily sold by the marketing, sales and customer service organizations of our AMS operations directly to manufacturers, given the customized nature of many of our products. However, in some geographic regions, we use sales agents and distributors to assist us in the sales process. As part of our integration efforts related to our recently acquired companies, we re-branded the acquired companies and transitioned our AMS sales operations toward a more unified organization. All acquired companies have been, or are in the process of being, re-branded as SWM and the AMS sales organization will operate and go to market under the SWM trade name, with sales resources deployed by end-market and focused on selling products from across the totality of AMS offerings. We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. 
Competition. Our AMS products are typically leaders in their respective categories and compete against specialty products made by competitors such as Marshall Manufacturing Company, Johns Manville, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Shaoxing Naite Plastics Co. Ltd., 3M Company, Covestro AG, Nupro Inc., Tenax Corporation, Intermas Group, and Hollingsworth and Vose Company. We believe our AMS products compete primarily on product features, innovations and customer service across the end-markets we serve, particularly in filtration and transportation. Of the end-markets we serve, infrastructure and construction is generally more price competitive due to a higher portion of commodity type products that we sell in this end-market. 
Raw Materials and Energy. The primary raw material used in our AMS products is plastic resin, and we rely on a variety of commodity grade and specialty resins, including polypropylene, polyurethane, polyethylene, polyamide (nylon) and a selection of specialized high temperature engineering grade resins. Our thermoplastic nets and apertured films are produced using a blend of specialty resins and commodity grade resins like polypropylene. Resin prices can fluctuate significantly and can impact profitability. Commodity grade resin prices can sometimes correlate with crude oil prices while specialty resin prices often do not. Our TPU films are produced using specialty resins which are significantly more expensive than commodity grade resins. 
We have multiple sources for most of our resin needs. However, some of our specialty resins are supplied by fewer manufacturers. We believe that our purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to procure needed raw materials from other suppliers. Our total resin purchases in 2020 and 2019 totaled $112 million and $135 million, respectively. 
The majority of our energy requirements relate to electricity in the U.S. We consider this to be a relatively stable energy source.
Engineered Papers
Products. Our EP segment produces both tobacco-related and non-tobacco-related papers. Our tobacco-related papers include various papers used in cigarette production and reconstituted tobacco ("Recon"), a reprocessed tobacco material, and comprise a large majority of EP's sales.
One of our key cigarette paper products is low ignition propensity ("LIP") cigarette paper. LIP cigarettes are designed to self-extinguish when not actively being smoked, thus offering a fire-safety feature. The U.S., the European Union ("E.U."), and several other smaller jurisdictions have mandated the use of LIP papers. Our solutions pioneered this cigarette paper category, and we remain a leader in this cigarette paper sub-segment through either direct sales or through licensing agreements. The Company maintains an extensive and active intellectual property "IP") portfolio. 
Recon is another key component of EP's total sales and profits and is mainly comprised of reconstituted tobacco leaf, (“RTL” or “traditional RTL”), and wrapper and binder products. Traditional RTL is used by cigarette manufacturers to blend with virgin tobacco to achieve certain attributes in cigarettes. Recently, a new generation of tobacco industry products generally referred to as Heat not Burn (“HnB”) have been introduced into the marketplace with a goal of reducing harmful effects of smoking. We have enhanced our tobacco fiber reconstitution capabilities to produce materials suited for this new application, are generating commercial sales, and continue to develop products to meet increasing demand should global consumer adoption gain further momentum and the technology gains additional support from appropriate regulatory authorities. Wrapper and binder product leverage our Recon technology for use in machine-made traditional and small cigars. These products have demonstrated growth in recent years due to positive consumer preference trends as well as favorable excise tax treatment versus cigarettes in some jurisdictions. 
Our non-tobacco paper products include a mix of lightweight papers including low-volume, high-value, engineered materials such as alkaline battery separator papers, as well as commodity paper grades for printing and writing, flooring laminates, and food service packaging, which are intended to maximize machine utilization. The Company has strategically de-emphasized these commoditized non-tobacco papers given their lower profitability.
We intend to make continued investments in our EP segment to broaden our offerings, utilize existing machine capacity, and/or further monetize our paper making and reconstitution technologies.
Our wet-laid paper making technologies can be broadly classified into two main production processes: flat-wire production and incline-wire production. Generally, our machines are flat-wire, meaning a liquid slurry of short pulp fibers and water are laid onto flat-wire conveyor belts, with the water draining through the wire as the fibers (wood, flax, tobacco, etc.) bond together to form a paper sheet. Incline-wire machines allow for increased drainage, enabling the use of longer fibers which bond into a more open web, increasing the porosity. Incline wire machines are typically associated with higher-value products given this added porosity, which is important in filtration and other specialty applications that tend to justify premium pricing. 
The Company continues to focus resources on innovation through activities in our OneFiber lab where paper customers can work closely with our technologists to develop improved paper-based products and our LeafLab fiber reconstitution incubator at our facility in France. Our reconstitution technologies have potential to be utilized in products serving the cosmetics and packaging industries reprocessing botanical, vegetable, or other plant fibers. Furthermore, SWM’s Recon technologists are active in joint development with several cigarette manufacturers to drive continued innovation and product commercialization in the rapidly emerging Heat not Burn tobacco product area. The Company has also responded to customer requests for industrial hemp (fiber containing less than 0.3% THC) fiber-based materials for use as wrappers and fillers and has developed products to meet demand for innovative hemp-based products.
Markets and Customers.  Our EP segment is heavily influenced by global smoking trends, particularly in the U.S., the E.U. (both LIP markets), and Brazil where we have the majority of our operations and highest share of the category's volume. Historically, mature geographic regions, such as the U.S. and the E.U. have exhibited a steady decline in smoking rates, often to the low-to-mid single digits. Overall, approximately 88% of EP segment sales are to customers in the tobacco end-market, with the majority of tobacco sales comprised of cigarette papers, and approximately 12% of EP segment sales are related to a variety of non-tobacco customers and applications.
We supply the major, and many of the smaller, cigarette and cigar manufacturers. We sell our products directly to the major tobacco companies or their designated converters in the Americas, Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Philip Morris-USA, a subsidiary of Altria Group Inc., Philip Morris International ("PMI"), Japan Tobacco Inc. ("JT"), and British American Tobacco ("BAT"), are our four largest customers and, together with their respective affiliates and designated converters, accounted for 28%, 29% and 28% of our 2020, 2019 and 2018 consolidated net sales, respectively. Although the total loss of one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, we do not believe that such a loss is likely given our significance in the worldwide supply chain of cigarette-related papers.
Sales and Distribution. Our internal marketing, sales and customer service organizations sell most of our tobacco-related products directly to cigarette manufacturers or their designated converters. Most of our EP segment's non-tobacco related products are sold directly to manufacturers. In some geographic regions, we use sales agents. We do not sell our products directly to consumers or advertise our products in consumer media. We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. 
Competition.  The specialized nature of tobacco-related papers requires unique papermaking equipment, technical expertise, and research and development capabilities to meet exacting customer specifications. These factors have limited the number of competitors capable of servicing global cigarette manufacturers.
As the sole domestic producer of cigarette papers in the Americas (SWM production in Brazil), we believe that we have a significant majority of the category share in those regions. Our paper plants in France and LIP printing facility in Poland produce a large amount of the products sold in the E.U. We estimate that we have a direct share of more than 50% of cigarette paper sales in the E.U., and coupled with royalty payments from a key competitor to whom we have licensed our LIP technology, we believe we are able to monetize over 80% of the LIP-compliant E.U. cigarette market. Our principal competitors include delfortgroup AG ("delfort"), which licenses our LIP 
technology, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. ("Miquel y Costas"), Julius Glatz GmbH ("Glatz") and PT Bukit Muria Jaya ("BMJ"). 
In December 2017, the Dusseldorf Court of Appeals affirmed the German District Court judgment of patent infringement against Glatz including an injunction against making and selling LIP cigarette paper. We believe that the basis of cigarette and our non-tobacco papers competition is price, consistent quality, security of supply, and level of technical service. 
Outside of China, SWM is the only non-cigarette company that produces RTL through a paper-making process. Some cigarette companies such as Philip Morris-USA, British American Tobacco, JT and STMA (China) produce RTL primarily for their own internal use. Our customers' cigarette blending decisions, which affect our traditional RTL sales volumes, can be influenced by the general attractiveness of various competing in-house Recon products. We believe we are the only non-cigarette manufacturer with production capabilities for HnB, as well as wrapper and binder products.
Raw Materials and Energy. Wood pulp is the primary fiber used in our EP segment. Our operations consumed approximately $32 million and $43 million of wood pulp in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, all of which we purchased. While EP uses other specialty fibers, such as flax, in our operations, we believe that purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources.
Paper production uses significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas and fuel oil. We believe that energy supply is generally reliable throughout our manufacturing footprint, although prices can fluctuate significantly based on demand. We enter into agreements to procure a portion of our energy requirements for future periods in order to reduce the uncertainty of future energy costs. 
Additional information regarding agreements for the supply of certain raw materials and energy is included in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Seasonality. Generally, sales of our paper and Recon products are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to periodic machine downtime and typically lower order volumes in the fourth quarter. 
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2020 we employ approximately 100 research and development employees in research and laboratory facilities in France, Brazil, and the U.S. We are dedicated to developing product innovations and improvements to meet the needs of individual customers. We believe that our research and product development capabilities have played an important role in establishing our reputation for high quality, superior products in both our AMS and EP segments. Within AMS, we have a history of finding innovative design solutions, including developing products that improve the performance of customers' products and manufacturing operations. We believe that our commitment to research and development, coupled with our investment in new technology and equipment, has positioned us to take advantage of growth opportunities in many places around the world. Within EP, our research and development has enabled us to establish and sustain leading shares in various cigarette paper products, specifically LIP paper. We also are working with customers to meet potential future demand for reduced-harm tobacco products as well as hemp-based products. 
Patents and Trademarks
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 88 patents and had 43 pending patent applications in our AMS segment. While we consider our patents, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or group of patents is material to the conduct of our AMS business segment.
In our AMS segment, as described in the branding initiative discussed above, SWM made a strategic decision to transition away from certain legacy business trade names associated with our recent acquisitions in favor of a streamlined SWM enterprise branding approach. The Company will continue to market its products under the long-
standing product-level brand names and trademarks such as "NALTEX®," "DELNET®," “ARGOGUARD®” and “ARGOTHANE®.”
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 314 patents and had 112 pending patent applications in our EP segment, covering a variety of cigarette papers, RTL, cigar wrapper and binder, hemp and other products and processes in the U.S., Western Europe and several other countries. We believe that our patents, together with our papermaking expertise and technical sales support, have been instrumental in establishing us as the leading worldwide supplier of cigarette papers. We believe that patents have contributed to our position as the world's leading independent producer of papers used for LIP cigarettes. 
Management believes that in the EP segment, our "ALGINEX®" water-based technology trademark, our "GLUCIGENTM" trademark for use in banded papers for the production of LIP cigarettes, and the "SWM" logo and trade names have been important contributors to the marketing of our products. Further, we have developed, individually or in conjunction with customers, technologies to address the demand for cigarette paper for LIP cigarettes in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the E.U. We have licensed to others the right to use certain of our LIP intellectual property, excluding ALGINEX® related intellectual properties.
Management of a large portion of SWM's research and development activities is provided from our Luxembourg City, Luxembourg operation ("SWM Luxembourg"). These activities are often performed at other SWM locations under contract by SWM Luxembourg, and funded by SWM Luxembourg. SWM Luxembourg has the authority to initiate and manage research and development projects in areas such as, but not limited to, LIP paper, Recon for HnB materials, non-tobacco paper products, netting and other extruded resin products. This operation also provides global oversight and active management for much of the Company's intellectual property rights.
Human Capital
At SWM we understand that employees are our most important asset and as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,600 regular, full-time, active employees. Our guiding principles create an environment where employees are encouraged to innovate and collaborate, acting as one company to place customers at the heart of our organization. Employee wellness and safety remain critical to our success. We have implemented proactive measures at our locations to help ensure workplace safety, including updated protocols to prevent and address potential or confirmed illness among our on-site workforce, additional spending on personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies, and dedicated time to perform additional sanitization procedures between shifts. We have increased the use of virtual platforms and tools, which has allowed many of our employees to work remotely. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We believe that employee relations are positive. Hourly employees at the Spotswood, New Jersey, Ancram, New York and Minneapolis, Minnesota, Pirahy, Brazil , Quimperlé, Spay, and Saint-Girons France and Gilberdyke, England plants are union represented. 
Government Regulation
We are required to comply with numerous regulations that are normal and customary to businesses in the regions, industries, and markets in which we operate. These regulations include, but are not limited to, tax, employment, privacy, imports/exports, healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse, product safety and efficacy, and other areas.
Governmental entities around the world have taken, or have proposed, actions that had, or are likely to have, the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products which, in turn, reduces demand for our products. These actions, including efforts to regulate, restrict or prohibit the sale, advertisement and promotion of tobacco products and their components, to limit smoking in public places, to control or restrict additives that may be used in tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products, are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other tobacco products.
Our facilities are subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws with respect to air, water and emissions as well as the disposal of solid waste. We believe that we are operating in substantial compliance with these laws and regularly incur capital and operating expenditures in order to achieve future compliance. Although we are not aware of any environmental conditions at any of our facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we own facilities in France, the U.S. and elsewhere that have been operated over the course of many decades. Should the Company make material changes in the operations at a facility it is possible such changes could generate environmental obligations that might require remediation or other action, the nature, extent and cost of which are not presently known. We may also face higher disposal and clean-up costs to replace equipment or facilities containing materials that were compliant when installed, but are now considered contaminants. Additionally, as we sell closed or other facilities or materially alter operations at a facility, we may be required to perform additional environmental evaluations that could identify items that might require remediation or other action, the nature, extent and cost of which are not presently known. We may also incur environmental liabilities in connection with assets or businesses we may purchase in the future.
The Company is subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, the Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Aspects of the Company’s operations and businesses are also subject to privacy, data security, and data protection regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data and operate our products and services.
The Company is not aware of any regulatory compliance matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, competitive position, financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures or cash flows.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Environmental, social, and governance issues are important to SWM, our employees, stockholders, customers, and the communities in which we operate. Corporate responsibility is one of our core values and has long been part of the SWM corporate mission. Across our company, we conduct business with environmental, social, ethical, and supply chain-related concerns in mind. As such, our manufacturing facilities and corporate office have a longstanding tradition of community engagement and reducing our impact on the environment. SWM recognizes that sustainability and profitability are not mutually exclusive, and our goal is to improve the sustainability of our products and processes to create shared value for all of our stakeholders. 
In 2018, the Operational Excellence and Sustainability department worked with key parties across SWM, including our Chief Executive Officer, to refresh our sustainability strategy, which was reviewed with the Board of Directors. We also updated our supplier code, the SWM Code for Responsible Procurement, and our Transparency in Supply Chains Act statement. 
A few of our key sustainability practices are highlighted below:
Environmental
•Sustainable Packaging Material: We manufacture Cocoa PaperTM as packaging material. Cocoa PaperTM is made from botanical fibers and is an eco-efficient product. Cocoa PaperTM fibers are 100% carbon neutral, a first in the Engineered Papers (EP) portfolio. Sales of Cocoa PaperTM benefit the Jacundá Forestry REDD+ Project in Brazil through the purchase of carbon credits to offset the impact of projected product sales.
•Sustainable Innovation: SWM developed RevonexTM membrane backing paper which improves reverse osmosis filtration efficiency by eliminating bleed-through. In support of the circular economy, SWM has transformed manufacturing byproducts into FlaxBedTM, specialty animal bedding, and BioLoxxTM spill absorbent, to help protect the environment.
•Partnership with Planet Water Foundation: SWM partners with Planet Water Foundation to support global efforts to improve access to clean, safe water. Currently, the partnership is focused on installing AquaTower water systems in two communities without adequate access to safe water ― Jalisco, Mexico and the Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. Each AquaTower system can produce up to 1,000 liters of clean water per hour, addressing the drinking needs of up to 1,800 people with each tower. SWM also funded the installation of two AquaSan sanitation systems, with the AquaTowers, that meet World Health Organization standards, three AquaHome solutions to provide families with solar powered electricity and drinking water at home, and two community-based education workshops focused on water-health and hygiene education.

•Community Support: In various ways, our facilities participate in philanthropic activities around the world, including programs to benefit local children and seniors, and raising funds for larger organizations. 
In April 2019, in recognition and celebration of the 49th Anniversary of Earth Month, 23 SWM manufacturing locations and the corporate office participated in Safety and Sustainability Week where sites engaged in activities involving safety, the environment, community engagement, and employee engagement. Activities included educating employees on a low-carbon lifestyle, recycling waste materials into art, picking up trash along roads, collecting book and canned food donations, bicycling challenges to promote a healthy lifestyle and raise funds for charities, fire extinguisher training and many others. Additionally, in 2020 we received an A- score for our CDP Climate Change response, as well as our fourth consecutive silver medal for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) recognition from EcoVadis, an organization that rates sustainability practices.

Working Capital
We normally maintain approximately 50 to 90 days of inventories to support our operations. Our sales terms average between 15 and 60 days for payment by our customers, dependent upon the products and market segment served. With respect to our accounts payable, we typically carry approximately 15 to 40 days outstanding, in accordance with our purchasing terms, which vary by business location. The accounts payable balance varies in relation to changes in our manufacturing operations, particularly due to changes in prices of wood pulp, resins and purchased energy and the level and timing of capital expenditures related to projects in progress.
