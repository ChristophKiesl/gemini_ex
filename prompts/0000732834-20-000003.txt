Item 1. | Business

General
We are an independent crude oil and natural gas company formed in 1967 engaged in the exploration, development, and production of crude oil and natural gas in the North, South and East regions of the United States. Additionally, we pursue the acquisition and management of perpetually owned minerals located in our key operating areas. The North region consists of properties north of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River and includes North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken, and the Red River units. The South region includes all properties south of Nebraska and west of the Mississippi River including various plays in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. The East region is primarily comprised of undeveloped leasehold acreage east of the Mississippi River with no significant drilling or production operations. 
A substantial portion of our operations is located in the North region, with that region comprising 60% of our crude oil and natural gas production and 71% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company’s principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana. Approximately 53% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 are located in the North region. Our operations in the South region continue to expand with our increased activity in Oklahoma and that region comprised 40% of our crude oil and natural gas production, 29% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues, and 47% of our proved reserves as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.
We focus our activities in large new or developing crude oil and natural gas plays that provide us the opportunity to acquire undeveloped acreage positions for future drilling operations. We have been successful in targeting large repeatable resource plays where three dimensional seismic, horizontal drilling, geosteering technologies, advanced completion technologies (e.g., fracture stimulation), pad/row development, and enhanced recovery technologies allow us to develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations. As a result of these efforts, we have grown substantially through the drill bit. 
As of December 31, 2019, our proved reserves were 1,619 MMBoe, with proved developed reserves representing 707 MMBoe, or 44%, of our total proved reserves. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. For 2019, we generated crude oil and natural gas revenues of $4.51 billion and operating cash flows of $3.12 billion. Crude oil accounted for 58% of our total production and 87% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2019. Our total production averaged 340,395 Boe per day for 2019, a 14% increase compared to 2018. 
The table below summarizes our total proved reserves, PV-10 (non-GAAP) and net producing wells as of December 31, 2019, average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and the reserve-to-production index in our principal operating areas. The PV-10 values shown below are not intended to represent the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates.

(1) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $1.4 billion. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion.


(2) | The Annualized Reserve/Production Index is the number of years that estimated proved reserves would last assuming current production continued at the same rate. This index is calculated by dividing annualized fourth quarter 2019 production into estimated proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2019.

Business Environment and Outlook
Our industry is impacted by volatility and uncertainty in commodity prices. Crude oil prices remained volatile throughout 2019, with West Texas Intermediate crude oil benchmark prices ranging from approximately $46 to $66 per barrel, and price volatility has continued into early 2020. Our leadership team has significant experience with operating in challenging commodity price environments. With our portfolio of high quality assets and strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to manage the ongoing challenges and price volatility facing our industry. 
For 2020, our primary business strategies will focus on: 

• | Continuing to increase shareholder value through free cash flow generation and shareholder capital return initiatives;


• | Generating corporate returns on capital employed that compete with the broader market through operational excellence, technical innovations, pad and row development, optimized completion methods, well productivity, and strategic mineral ownership;


• | Continuing to exercise disciplined capital spending to maintain financial flexibility and ample liquidity; and


• | Stock repurchases and/or reducing outstanding debt using available operating cash flows, proceeds from asset dispositions, or joint development arrangements.

Our Business Strategies
Despite volatility and uncertainty in commodity prices, our business strategies continue to be focused on increasing shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves at low costs that provide attractive rates of return. The principal elements of this strategy include:
Growing and sustaining a premier portfolio of assets focused on increasing shareholder value through free cash flow generation and shareholder capital return initiatives. We are focused on increasing shareholder value and returns. We hold a portfolio of leasehold acreage, drilling opportunities, uncompleted wells, perpetually owned minerals, and water infrastructure 
assets in certain premier U.S. resource plays with varying access to crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. We pursue opportunities to develop our existing properties as well as explore for new resource plays where significant reserves may be economically developed. Our capital programs are designed to allocate investments to projects that provide opportunities to deliver production growth at low costs while generating cash flows in excess of operating and capital requirements, harvest our inventory of uncompleted wells, convert our undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, and improve hydrocarbon recoveries and rates of return on capital employed. 
Our assets and execution generated strong free cash flows in 2018 and 2019 and we plan to remain focused on generating cash flow positive growth for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, in 2019 we initiated a strategy to increase shareholder value and returns that included the commencement of a $1 billion share repurchase program and the payment of a quarterly dividend. Through year-end 2019 we had executed $190.2 million of share repurchases and we paid our first cash dividend of $0.05 per share in November 2019. We are strongly aligned with shareholders and our strategic vision is predicated on our desire to increase shareholder value through dividends, share repurchases, continued debt reduction, and other means. 
Generating corporate returns on capital employed that compete with the broader market through operational excellence, technical innovations, pad and row development, optimized completions, well productivity, and strategic mineral ownership. We are focused on generating strong corporate returns on capital employed that compete with the broader market. We continue to manage our business in the volatile commodity price environment by focusing on improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs by exploiting technical innovations, pad and row development opportunities, and other means. Our key operating areas are characterized by large acreage positions in select unconventional resource plays with multiple stacked geologic formations that provide repeatable drilling opportunities and resource potential. We operate a significant portion of our wells and leasehold acreage and believe the concentration of our operated assets allows us to leverage our technical expertise and manage the development of our properties to enhance operating efficiencies and economies of scale. Our operational excellence has allowed us to achieve and maintain enviable low-cost operations. 
Additionally, we capitalize on our geologic knowledge and land expertise to strategically acquire minerals in areas of future growth, thereby allowing us to enhance cash flows and project economics through the alignment of mineral ownership with our drilling schedule. Further, we continue to develop our water gathering, recycling, and disposal infrastructure which allows for uninterrupted flow back and recycling capabilities, supports timely completion activities, and generates additional service revenues and cash flows. Our strategies for growing our mineral ownership portfolio and water infrastructure assets serve as additional avenues to increase shareholder returns. 
Maintaining capital discipline, financial flexibility, and a strong balance sheet. Maintaining capital discipline, a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and financial flexibility are key components of our business strategy. In 2019, we reduced our total debt by $442 million, or 8%. We are targeting further debt reduction using available cash, operating cash flows, or proceeds from potential sales of non-strategic assets and joint development opportunities and will continue our focus on preserving financial flexibility and ample liquidity as we manage the risks facing our industry. 
Focusing on organic growth through disciplined capital investments. Although we consider various growth opportunities, including property acquisitions, our primary focus is on organic growth through leasing and drilling in our core areas where we can exploit our extensive inventory of repeatable drilling opportunities to achieve attractive rates of return. 
Our Business Strengths
We have a number of strengths we believe will help us successfully execute our business strategies, including the following:
Large acreage inventory. We held approximately 458,500 net undeveloped acres and 1.23 million net developed acres under lease as of December 31, 2019 concentrated in certain premier U.S. resource plays. We are among the largest leaseholders in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK plays. Being an early entrant in these plays has allowed us to capture significant acreage positions in core parts of the plays. 
Expertise with pad and row development, horizontal drilling, and optimized completion methods. We have substantial experience with horizontal drilling and optimized completion methods and continue to be among industry leaders in the use of new drilling and completion technologies. We continue to improve drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multi-well pad and row development strategies. Further, we are among industry leaders in drilling long lateral lengths. We have also been among industry leaders in testing and utilizing optimized completion technologies involving various combinations of fluid types, proppant types and volumes, and stimulation stage spacing to determine optimal methods for improving recoveries and rates of return. We continually refine our drilling and completion techniques in an effort to deliver improved results across our properties. 
Control Operations Over a Substantial Portion of Our Assets and Investments. As of December 31, 2019, we operated properties comprising 86% of our total proved reserves. By controlling a significant portion of our operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and completion methods used. 
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry and with operating in challenging commodity price environments. Our Executive Chairman, Harold G. Hamm, began his career in the oil and gas industry in 1967. Our 9 executive officers have an average of 41 years of oil and gas industry experience.
Financial Position and Liquidity. We have a credit facility with lender commitments totaling $1.5 billion that matures in April 2023. We had no outstanding borrowings on the facility at January 31, 2020. Our credit facility is unsecured and does not have a borrowing base requirement that is subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating do not trigger a reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants. 
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations
Proved Reserves
Proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain. In connection with the estimation of proved reserves, the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence the quantities of crude oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott Company, L.P (“Ryder Scott”), our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps including isopach and structure maps, analogy and statistical analysis, and available downhole, production, seismic, and well test data.
The table below sets forth estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves information by reserve category as of December 31, 2019. Proved reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests are immaterial and are not separately presented herein. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled approximately $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2019 are based primarily on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. In preparing its report, Ryder Scott evaluated properties representing approximately 93% of our PV-10 and 91% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019. Our internal technical staff evaluated the remaining properties. A copy of Ryder Scott’s summary report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV-10 at December 31, 2019 were determined using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the period of January 2019 through December 2019, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the lives of the properties. These prices were $55.69 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.58 per MMBtu for natural gas ($51.95 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.02 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials).

Proved reserves at end of year | 1,619,265 | | | 1,522,365 | | 1,330,995 | 

Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions for 2019 are comprised of (i) the removal of 17 MMBo and 108 Bcf (totaling 35 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking due to the continual refinement of our drilling programs and reallocation of capital to areas providing the greatest opportunities to improve efficiencies, recoveries, and rates of return, (ii) downward revisions of 38 MMBo and 278 Bcf (totaling 85 MMBoe) from the removal of PUD reserves due to changes in economics, performance, and other factors, (iii) downward price revisions of 24 MMBo and 118 Bcf (totaling 43 MMBoe) due to a decrease in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2019 compared to 2018, and (iv) net downward revisions for oil reserves of 9 MMBo and net upward revisions for natural gas reserves of 139 Bcf (netting to 14 MMBoe of upward revisions) due to changes in ownership interests, operating costs, anticipated production, and other factors.
Extensions, discoveries and other additions. Extensions, discoveries and other additions for each of the three years reflected in the table above were due to successful drilling and completion activities and continual refinement of our drilling programs in the Bakken, SCOOP, and STACK plays. Proved reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 160 MMBoe, 251 MMBoe, and 148 MMBoe for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, while reserve additions in SCOOP totaled 186 MMBoe, 186 MMBoe, and 53 MMBoe for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Additionally, reserve additions in STACK totaled 19 MMBoe, 128 MMBoe, and 39 MMBoe in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for a discussion of our 2019 drilling activities. 
Sales of minerals in place. We had no individually significant dispositions of proved reserves in the past three years. 
Purchases of minerals in place. We had no individually significant acquisitions of proved reserves in the past three years.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves
All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2019 are located in the Bakken, SCOOP, and STACK plays, our most active development areas, with those plays comprising 53%, 37%, and 10%, respectively, of our total PUD reserves at year-end 2019. The following table provides information regarding changes in our PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our PUD reserves at December 31, 2019 include 91 MMBoe of reserves associated with wells where drilling has occurred but the wells have not been completed or are completed but not producing ("DUC wells"). Our DUC wells are classified as PUD reserves when relatively major expenditures are required to complete and produce from the wells. 
 | Crude Oil(MBbls) | | Natural Gas(MMcf) | | Total(MBoe)
Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018 | 409,271 | | | 2,627,325 | | 847,159 |

Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019 | 423,782 | | | 2,928,354 | | 911,841 | 

Revisions of previous estimates. As previously discussed, in 2019 we removed 17 MMBo and 108 Bcf (totaling 35 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking due to the continual refinement of our drilling programs. Of these removals, 12 MMBo and 39 Bcf (totaling 19 MMBoe) was related to Bakken properties, 4 MMBo and 56 Bcf (totaling 13 MMBoe) was related to SCOOP properties, and 1 MMBo and 13 Bcf (totaling 3 MMBoe) was related to STACK properties. Additionally, changes in economics, performance, and other factors resulted in downward PUD reserve revisions of 38 MMBo and 278 Bcf (totaling 85 MMBoe) in 2019. Decreases in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2019 resulted in downward price revisions of 11 MMBo and 67 Bcf (totaling 22 MMBoe). Finally, changes in ownership interests, operating costs, anticipated production, and other factors resulted in net downward revisions for oil PUD reserves of 6 MMBo and net upward revisions for natural gas PUD reserves of 9 Bcf (totaling a net downward revision of 5 MMBoe) in 2019.
Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries were due to successful drilling activities and continual refinement of our drilling programs in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK plays. PUD reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 107 MMBo and 261 Bcf (totaling 150 MMBoe) in 2019, while SCOOP PUD reserve additions totaled 43 MMBo and 793 Bcf (totaling 176 MMBoe) and STACK PUD reserve additions totaled 1 MMBo and 90 Bcf (totaling 16 MMBoe). 
Sales of minerals in place. We had no individually significant dispositions of PUD reserves in 2019.
Purchases of minerals in place. We had no individually significant acquisitions of PUD reserves in 2019.
Conversion to proved developed reserves. In 2019, we developed approximately 20% of our PUD locations and 16% of our PUD reserves booked as of December 31, 2018 through the drilling and completion of 480 gross (217 net) development wells at an aggregate capital cost of $1.1 billion incurred in 2019. 
Development plans. We have acquired substantial leasehold positions in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK plays. Our drilling programs to date in those areas have focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through strategic drilling, thereby increasing the amount of leasehold acreage in the secondary term of the lease with no further drilling obligations (i.e., categorized as held by production) and resulting in a reduced amount of leasehold acreage in the primary term of the lease. While we may opportunistically drill strategic exploratory wells, a substantial portion of our future capital expenditures will be focused on developing our PUD locations, including our drilled but not completed locations. Our inventory of DUC wells classified as PUDs total 386 gross (138 net) operated and non-operated locations at December 31, 2019 and represent 10% of our PUD reserves at that date. The costs to drill our uncompleted wells were incurred prior to December 31, 2019 and only the remaining completion costs are included in future development plans. 
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUD reserves are projected to be approximately $1.8 billion in 2020, $2.2 billion in 2021, $2.0 billion in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2023, and $1.7 billion in 2024. These capital expenditure projections have been established based on an expectation of drilling and completion costs, available cash flows, borrowing capacity, and the commodity price environment in effect at the time of preparing our reserve estimates and may be adjusted as market conditions evolve. Development of our existing PUD reserves at December 31, 2019 is expected to occur within five years of the date of initial booking of the PUDs. PUD reserves not expected to be drilled within five years of initial booking 
because of changes in business strategy or for other reasons have been removed from our reserves at December 31, 2019. We had no PUD reserves at December 31, 2019 that remain undeveloped beyond five years from the date of initial booking. 
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Ryder Scott, our independent reserves evaluation consulting firm, estimated, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC, 93% of our PV-10 and 91% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 included in this Form 10-K. The Ryder Scott technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Refer to Exhibit 99 included with this Form 10-K for further discussion of the qualifications of Ryder Scott personnel.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserves engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team is in contact regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott’s preparation of the year-end reserves estimates. Proved reserves information is reviewed by our Audit Committee with representatives of Ryder Scott and by our internal technical staff before the information is filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. Additionally, certain members of our senior management review and approve the Ryder Scott reserves report and on a semi-annual basis review any internal proved reserves estimates.
Our Vice President—Corporate Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering, an MBA in Finance and 35 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations, acquisitions, engineering and evaluations. He has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering most of his career and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Vice President—Corporate Reserves reports directly to our Vice Chairman of Strategic Growth Initiatives. The reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by certain members of the Company's executive management.
Proved Reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 Sensitivities
Our year-end 2019 proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 estimates were prepared using 2019 average first-day-of-the-month prices of $55.69 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.58 per MMBtu for natural gas ($51.95 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.02 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than those used in our year-end estimates. 
Provided below are sensitivities illustrating the potential impact on our estimated proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 at December 31, 2019 under different commodity price scenarios for crude oil and natural gas. In these sensitivities, all factors other than the commodity price assumption have been held constant for each well.

As of December 31, 2019, there were 509 gross (190 net) operated and non-operated wells that have been spud and are in the process of drilling, completing or waiting on completion. 
Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
In the following discussion, we review our budgeted number of wells and capital expenditures for 2020 in our key operating areas. Our 2020 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be
funded from operating cash flows. Our drilling and completion activities and the actual amount and timing of our capital expenditures may differ materially from our budget as a result of, among other things, available cash flows, unbudgeted acquisitions, actual drilling and completion results, the availability of drilling and completion rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of transportation and processing capacity, changes in commodity prices, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. We monitor our capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and may scale back our spending should commodity prices decrease from current levels. Conversely, an increase in commodity prices from current levels could result in increased capital expenditures. 
The following table provides information regarding well counts and budgeted capital expenditures for 2020.

North Region 
Our properties in the North region represented 53% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 55% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2019. Our principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field.
Bakken Field
The Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana is one of the largest crude oil resource plays in the United States. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the Bakken. As of December 31, 2019, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in the Bakken with approximately 1.3 million gross (810,200 net) acres under lease. 
Our total Bakken production averaged 194,156 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2019, up 6% from the 2018 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our average daily Bakken production increased 16% over 2018, reflecting additional drilling and completion activities. In 2019, we participated in the drilling and completion of 379 gross (124 net) wells in the Bakken compared to 496 gross (169 net) wells in 2018. Our 2019 activities in the Bakken focused on ongoing multi-zone unit development of high rate-of-return areas in the play. 
Our Bakken properties represented 52% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2019 and 53% of our average daily Boe production for the 2019 fourth quarter. Our total proved Bakken field reserves as of December 31, 2019 were 834 MMBoe, an increase of 5% compared to December 31, 2018 primarily due to reserves added from our drilling and development program and continued improvement in recoveries driven by operating efficiencies and advances in optimized completion designs. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the Bakken totaled 1,997 gross (944 net) wells as of December 31, 2019.
For 2020, our budget for exploration and development capital expenditures in the North region is $1.37 billion. In 2020, we expect to have first production on 406 gross (154 net) operated and non-operated wells in the North region. We plan to average approximately nine operated rigs and four well completion crews in the North region throughout 2020. Our 2020 drilling and completion activities in the Bakken will focus on ongoing multi-zone unit development in areas that provide opportunities to improve capital efficiency, reduce finding and development costs, improve recoveries and rates of return, and achieve sustainable and repeatable results. Notably, in 2020 we plan to ramp up development activities on our 10-square mile Long Creek Bakken Unit in Williams County, North Dakota, with production from the project beginning in late 2020 and increasing into 2021. This unit is another high impact oil project for the Company that was formed to capitalize on our dominant ownership position in the area and will be exploited using row development to maximize efficiencies and value, much like our SpringBoard project in SCOOP described below. 
South Region
Our properties in the South region represented 47% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 45% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2019. Our principal producing properties in the South region are located in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. 
SCOOP
The SCOOP play extends across Garvin, Grady, Stephens, Carter, McClain and Love counties in Oklahoma and contains crude oil and condensate-rich fairways as delineated by numerous industry wells. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the SCOOP play. As of December 31, 2019, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in SCOOP with approximately 452,000 gross (261,200 net) acres under lease. 
SCOOP represented 36% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 31% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2019. Production in SCOOP averaged 111,829 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2019, up 66% compared to the 2018 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2019, average daily production in SCOOP increased 29% compared to 2018, reflecting increased drilling and completion activities in our Project SpringBoard play described below. We participated in the drilling and completion of 207 gross (93 net) wells in SCOOP during 2019 compared to 148 gross (48 net) wells in 2018, which helped generate a 25% increase in proved reserves during the year to 576 MMBoe as of December 31, 2019. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in SCOOP totaled 577 gross (287 net) wells as of December 31, 2019.
Our 2019 activities in SCOOP were focused on ongoing row development of leasehold in our oil-weighted Project SpringBoard play. SpringBoard is a large, multi-year, crude oil project controlled and operated by Continental that covers approximately 73 square miles of contiguous leasehold in Grady County, Oklahoma where we are concurrently developing three stacked reservoirs in the Springer, Sycamore, and Woodford formations. These reservoirs are being developed in rows to maximize efficiencies and rates of return through the orderly sequencing of drilling and completion activities. This row development strategy allows us to realize significant cost savings. In addition to cost saving benefits, our SpringBoard production benefits 
12

from access to premium sales markets through existing pipeline infrastructure, making our SpringBoard sales price realizations among the best in the Company. Additionally, water pipeline and recycling facilities are in place to allow for uninterrupted flow back and recycling capabilities to support timely completion activities in the project. 
To date, Project SpringBoard has outperformed our production targets due to operational efficiency gains and strong well performance, which allowed us to reduce our rig count in Oklahoma in 2019 while still achieving our production growth objectives. This outperformance had a meaningful impact on our oil-weighted production growth during the year and contributed to a 69% increase in crude oil production from our SCOOP properties in 2019 compared to 2018. 
STACK
STACK is a significant resource play located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma characterized by stacked geologic formations with major targets in the Meramec, Osage, and Woodford formations. As of December 31, 2019, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in STACK with approximately 393,200 gross (221,900 net) acres under lease. A significant portion of our STACK acreage is located in over-pressured portions of Blaine, Dewey and Custer counties of Oklahoma where we believe the reservoirs are typically thicker and deliver superior production rates relative to normal-pressured areas of the STACK petroleum system. 
Our STACK properties represented 11% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 14% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2019. Production in STACK averaged 51,628 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2019, down 18% over the 2018 fourth quarter due to changes in the timing of initial production from new well completions between periods. For the year ended December 31, 2019, average daily production in STACK decreased 3% from 2018 due to moderated drilling and completion activities resulting from a greater allocation of capital to other areas during the year. We participated in the drilling and completion of 103 gross (19 net) wells in STACK during 2019 compared to 154 gross (40 net) wells in 2018. Proved reserves in STACK decreased 21% year-over-year to 182 MMBoe as of December 31, 2019 due primarily to the removal of PUD reserves from changes in economics, performance, and other factors. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in STACK totaled 156 gross (52 net) wells as of December 31, 2019.
Highlighting our 2019 activity in the STACK play was the completion of the Reba Jo and Schulte units, which consisted of 14 total wells targeting two separate benches in the Meramec formation in the STACK over-pressured oil window. These combined units delivered outstanding initial production results with initial 24-hour production averaging 4,092 Boe per day per well, ranking the wells amongst the best in Company history.
For 2020, our aggregate budget for exploration and development capital expenditures in the South region is $843 million. In 2020, we expect to have first production on 254 gross (91 net) operated and non-operated wells in the South region. We plan to average approximately 11 operated rigs and three well completion crews in the South region throughout 2020. Our 2020 activities in SCOOP will focus on continued row development in Project SpringBoard and achieving operational and technical advancements aimed at further improving capital efficiencies and rates of return. Our 2020 activities in STACK will focus on continued development of oil and liquids-rich assets in the over-pressured windows of the play and improving capital efficiencies, recoveries, and rates of return.

Title to Properties
As is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, upon initiation of acquiring oil and gas leases covering fee mineral interests on undeveloped lands which do not have associated proved reserves, contract landmen conduct a title examination of courthouse records and production databases to determine fee mineral ownership and availability. Title, lease forms and terms are reviewed and approved by Company landmen prior to consummation. 
For acquisitions from third parties, whether lands are producing crude oil and natural gas or non-producing, Company and contract landmen perform title examinations at applicable courthouses, obtain physical well site inspections, and examine the seller’s internal records (land, legal, operational, production, environmental, well, marketing and accounting) upon execution of a mutually acceptable purchase and sale agreement. Company landmen may also procure an acquisition title opinion from outside legal counsel on higher value properties. 
Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, Company landmen procure an original title opinion, or supplement an existing title opinion, from outside legal counsel and perform curative work to satisfy requirements pertaining to material title defects, if any. Company landmen will not approve commencement of drilling operations until material title defects pertaining to the Company’s interest are cured. 
The Company has cured material title opinion defects as to Company interests on substantially all of its producing properties and believes it holds at least defensible title to its producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The Company’s crude oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and leasehold burdens which do not materially interfere with the Company’s interest in the properties or affect the Company’s carrying value of such properties.
Marketing and Major Customers
We sell most of our operated crude oil production to crude oil refining companies or midstream marketing companies at major market centers. In the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK areas, we have significant volumes of production directly connected to pipeline gathering systems, with the remaining balance of production primarily transported by truck either directly to a refinery or to a point on a pipeline system for further delivery. We do not transport any of our oil production prior to sale by rail, but several purchasers of our Bakken production are connected to rail delivery systems and may choose those methods to transport the oil they purchase from us. We sell some operated crude oil production at the lease. Our share of crude oil production from non-operated properties is marketed at the discretion of the operators. 
We sell our operated natural gas production to midstream customers at our lease locations based on market prices in the field where the sales occur. These contracts include multi-year term agreements, many with acreage dedication. Under certain arrangements, we have the right to take a volume of processed residue gas and/or natural gas liquids ("NGLs") in-kind at the tailgate of the midstream customer's processing plant in lieu of a monetary settlement for the sale of our operated natural gas production. We currently take certain processed residue gas volumes in kind in lieu of monetary settlement, but we do not currently take NGL volumes. When we do take volumes in kind, we pay third parties to transport the residue gas volumes taken in kind to downstream delivery points, where we then sell to customers at prices applicable to those downstream markets. Sales at the downstream markets are mostly under monthly interruptible packaged volume deals, short term seasonal packages, and long term multi-year contracts. We continue to develop relationships and have the potential to enter into additional contracts with end-use customers, including utilities, industrial users, and liquefied natural gas exporters, for sale of products we elect to take in-kind in lieu of monetary settlement for our leasehold sales. Our share of natural gas production from non-operated properties is generally marketed at the discretion of the operators. 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Valero Energy Corporation and its affiliates accounted for approximately 13% of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues. No other purchaser accounted for more than 10% of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2019. The loss of any single purchaser will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers in various regions.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas, and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors vary within the regions in which we operate, and some of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for crude oil and natural gas properties, minerals, and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions economically in a highly competitive environment. In 
addition, as a result of depressed commodity prices in recent years, the number of providers of materials and services has decreased in the regions where we operate. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing competition and shortages of materials and services may be further increased in connection with any period of sustained commodity price recovery. Finally, the emerging impact of climate change activism, fuel conservation measures, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing demand for alternative forms of energy, and technological advances in energy generation devices may create new competitive conditions that result in reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. 
Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry
All of our operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The crude oil and natural gas industry in the United States is subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, and interpretations affecting our industry have been and are pervasive with the frequent imposition of new or increased requirements on us and other industry participants. These laws, regulations and other requirements often carry substantial penalties for failure to comply and may have a significant effect on our operations and may increase the cost of doing business and reduce our profitability. In addition, because public policy changes affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because laws, rules and regulations may be enacted, amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws, rules and regulations. We do not expect future legislative or regulatory initiatives will affect us materially different than they will affect our similarly situated competitors.
The following is a discussion of certain significant laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, that may affect us in the areas in which we operate.
Regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids
Our physical sales of crude oil and any derivative instruments relating to crude oil are subject to anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). These laws, among other things, prohibit fraudulent or deceptive conduct in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we can be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
We transport most of our operated crude oil production to market centers using a combination of trucks and pipeline transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration establishes safety regulations relating to transportation of crude oil by pipeline. Further, our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids ("NGLs") is subject to rate and access regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates interstate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. In general, pipeline rates must be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. Intrastate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates may be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. As the interstate and intrastate transportation rates we pay are generally applicable to all comparable shippers, the regulation of such transportation rates will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the effect on our similarly situated competitors.
Further, interstate pipelines and intrastate common carrier pipelines must provide service on an equitable basis and offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When such pipelines operate at full capacity we are subject to proration provisions, which are described in the pipelines’ published tariffs. We generally will have access to crude oil pipeline transportation services to the same extent as our similarly situated competitors.
From time to time we may sell our operated crude oil production at market centers in the United States to third parties who then subsequently export and sell the crude oil in international markets. The International Maritime Organization ("IMO"), an agency of the United Nations, has issued regulations requiring the maritime shipping industry to gradually reduce its carbon emissions over time by mandating a 1% improvement in the efficiency of fleets each year between 2015 and 2025. In conjunction with this initiative, the IMO issued regulations requiring ship owners to lower the concentration of the sulfur content used in their fuels from 3.5% to 0.5% beginning on January 1, 2020. To achieve and maintain compliance with the new regulations, it is expected ship owners will either have to switch to more expensive higher quality marine fuel, install and utilize emissions-cleaning systems, or switch to alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas. Failure to comply with the regulations may result in fines or shipping vessels being detained, thereby resulting in exportation capacity constraints that inhibit a third party's ability to transport and sell domestic crude oil production overseas, which may have a material impact on the markets and prices for various grades of domestic and international crude oil. The costs of ocean going freight are expected to initially increase as the shipping industry adapts to the new regulations, which may have far reaching consequences for 
domestic and global economies through increased consumer prices and other effects. Although preparatory efforts have been undertaken by the shipping industry and fuel oil suppliers to comply with the new rules that went into effect on January 1, 2020, the ultimate long-term impact of the IMO regulations remains uncertain. 
We do not own or operate pipeline or rail transportation facilities, rail cars, or infrastructure used to facilitate the exportation of crude oil. However, regulations that impact the domestic transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at market centers throughout the United States. We do not expect such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors.
Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas
We are also required to observe the aforementioned anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and CFTC in connection with physical sales of natural gas and any derivative instruments relating to natural gas. Additionally, the FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, which affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The FERC has endeavored to increase competition and make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis and has issued a series of orders to implement its open access policies. We cannot provide any assurance the pro-competitive regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe any action taken by the FERC will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated natural gas producers.
The gathering of natural gas, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is generally regulated by the states. Although its policies on gathering systems have varied in the past, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the potential to increase costs for our purchasers and reduce the revenues we receive for our natural gas stream. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, equitable take requirements. We do not believe such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors.
Intrastate natural gas transportation service is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers on a comparable basis, the regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation in states in which we operate will not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors.
The U.S. Department of Energy (“U.S. DOE”) regulates the terms and conditions for the exportation and importation of natural gas (including liquefied natural gas or “LNG”). U.S. law provides for very limited regulation of exports to and imports from any country that has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (“FTA”) with the United States providing for national treatment of trade in natural gas; however, the U.S. DOE’s regulation of imports and exports from and to countries without an FTA is more comprehensive. The FERC also regulates the construction and operation of import and export facilities, including LNG terminals. Regulation of imports and exports and related facilities may materially affect natural gas markets and sales prices and could inhibit the development of LNG infrastructure.
Regulation of production
The production of crude oil and natural gas is regulated by a wide range of federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, which require, among other matters, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Each of the states where we own and operate properties have laws and regulations governing conservation, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, the plugging and abandonment of wells, the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and limitations or prohibitions on the venting or flaring of natural gas. These laws and regulations directly and indirectly limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells and locations we can drill, although we can and do apply for exceptions to such laws and regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production, severance or excise tax on the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
The failure to comply with the above laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our similarly situated competitors are generally subject to the same laws, rules, and regulations as we are.
Environmental regulation
General. We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations governing environmental compliance, including the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with crude oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas including areas containing endangered species of plants and animals;


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations.

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below a rate otherwise possible. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and federal and state legislators and agencies frequently revise environmental laws, rules and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal, cleanup and remediation requirements for the crude oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs and production of oil and gas.
Failure to comply with these and other laws, rules and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects, the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations, and potential litigation. The following is a description of some of the environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to our operations. 
Air emissions and climate change. Federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations have been and may be enacted to address concerns about emissions of regulated air pollutants, including the potential effects of carbon dioxide, methane and other identified “greenhouse gas” emissions on the environment and climate worldwide, generally referred to as “climate change.” For example, in October 2015 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. 
With respect to climate change and the control of greenhouse gas emissions, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases as well as to restrict or eliminate future emissions. Federal regulatory initiatives have focused on establishing construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources, requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. For example, in June 2016 the EPA finalized new regulations (New Source Performance Standard Subpart OOOOa, commonly referred to as “Quad Oa”) setting methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. Following the change in U.S. presidential administrations in 2016, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is ongoing. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored "Paris Agreement," which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020.
In addition, increasing concern over the threat of climate change arising from greenhouse gas emissions has given rise to a series of political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases, including pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020 to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments, and 
other parties have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability issues and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy could result in reduced access to capital, higher costs of capital and the restriction, delay, or cancellation of development and production activities. 
While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change, we anticipate that initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will continue to develop. The adoption of state or federal legislation or regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including methane and carbon dioxide, could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions monitoring and control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in restrictions or cancellations in development and production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climate changes, or increases in the cost of consuming hydrocarbons and thereby reducing demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, one or more of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
Environmental protection and natural gas flaring. One of our environmental initiatives is the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, particularly with respect to the flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites in the Bakken field of North Dakota. North Dakota statutes permit flaring of natural gas from a well that has not been connected to a gas gathering line for a period of one year from the date of a well’s first production. After one year, a producer is required to cap the well, connect it to a gas gathering line, find acceptable alternative uses for a percentage of the flared gas, or apply to the North Dakota Industrial Commission ("NDIC") for a written exemption for any future flaring; otherwise, the producer is required to pay royalties and production taxes based on the volume and value of the gas flared from the unconnected well. 
In addition, NDIC rules for new drilling permit applications also require the submission of gas capture plans addressing measures taken by operators to capture and not flare produced gas, regardless of whether it has been or will be connected within the first year of production. The NDIC currently requires us to capture 88% of the natural gas produced from a field, and beginning November 1, 2020 the target capture rate increases to 91%. If an operator is unable to attain the applicable gas capture percentage goal at maximum efficient rate, wells will be restricted in production to 200 barrels of crude oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or otherwise crude oil production from such wells is not permitted to exceed 100 barrels of crude oil per day. However, the NDIC will consider temporary exemptions from the foregoing restrictions or for other types of extenuating circumstances after notice and hearing if the effect of such flexibility is a significant net increase in gas capture within one year of the date such relief is granted. Monetary penalty provisions also apply under this policy in the event an operator not meeting the gas capture percentage goals fails to timely file for a hearing with the NDIC upon being unable to meet such percentage goals or if the operator fails to timely implement production restrictions once below the applicable percentage goals. Ongoing compliance with the NDIC’s flaring requirements or the imposition of any additional limitations on flaring could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our operations.
We continue to strive to reduce natural gas flaring as much as practicable, but our efforts may not always be successful or cost-effective. Our levels of flaring may be dependent upon external factors such as investment from third parties in the development and continued operation of gas gathering and processing facilities and the granting of reasonable right-of-way access by land owners. Increased emissions from our facilities due to flaring could subject our facilities to more stringent air emission permitting requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs and potential construction delays.
Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. In recent years there has been public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state agencies have studied the environmental risks with respect to hydraulic fracturing, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. 
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance 
related to such activities. Also, the EPA has issued a final regulation under the Clean Water Act prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. It has not been our practice to discharge wastewater to publicly owned treatment works, so the impact of this regulation on us is not currently, and is not expected to be, material. 
In late 2016 the EPA published a final study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources in which the EPA indicated it found evidence that such activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. In its final report, the EPA indicated it was not able to calculate or estimate the national frequency of impacts on drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing activities or fully characterize the severity of impacts. Nonetheless, the results of the EPA’s study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. 
In 2015, the BLM issued final rules related to the regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water. However, the BLM subsequently rescinded the rules in 2017. Litigation challenging the BLM's rescission has been filed by certain states and environmental groups and remains ongoing. As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately 60,300 net undeveloped acres on federal land, representing approximately 13% of our total net undeveloped acres. 
From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, certain candidates running for the office of President of the United States in 2020 have pledged to ban hydraulic fracturing and, on January 28, 2020, one of those candidates introduced Senate Bill 3247 that, if enacted as proposed, would ban hydraulic fracturing nationwide by 2025.
In addition, regulators in states in which we operate have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (the “OCC”) has promulgated guidance for operators of crude oil and natural gas wells in certain seismically-active areas of the SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma. The OCC's guidance provides for seismic monitoring and for implementation of mitigation procedures, which may include curtailment or even suspension of operations in the event of concurrent seismic events within a particular radius of operations of a magnitude exceeding 2.5 on the Richter scale. If seismic events exceeding the OCC guidance thresholds were to occur near our active stimulation operations on a frequent basis, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Waste water disposal. Underground injection wells are a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. In response to seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have investigated whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. Some states, including states in which we operate, have delayed permit approvals, mandated a reduction in injection volumes, or have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of injection wells. Regulators in states in which we operate have implemented additional requirements related to seismicity. For example, the OCC has adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas in the Arbuckle formation of Oklahoma. These rules require, among other things, that disposal well operators conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ respective depths that, depending on the depth, could require plugging the well and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. Oklahoma utilizes a “traffic light” system wherein the OCC reviews new or existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. At the federal level, the EPA’s current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. We cannot predict the EPA’s future actions in this regard. 
The introduction of new environmental laws and regulations related to the disposal of wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize underground injection wells. A lack of waste water disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. Additionally, increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. These costs are commonly incurred by oil and gas producers and we do not believe the costs associated with the disposal of produced water will have a material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors. In recent years we have increased our operation and use of water recycling and distribution facilities in Oklahoma that economically reuse stimulation water for both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits.
We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized. Although we believe our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, we cannot assure you the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Employee Health and Safety. We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulation under Title III of the federal superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state laws and regulations require information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed 1,260 people. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We also utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services.
