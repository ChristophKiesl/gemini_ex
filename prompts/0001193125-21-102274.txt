ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction 
 We are a blank-check company incorporated on October 13, 2020, as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets (a business combination). Since the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination with an operating business, including entering into discussions with potential target businesses, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or had discussions with or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a shell company as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting solely of cash and/or cash equivalents. 
 On October 13, 2020, our Sponsor purchased 100 shares of undesignated common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100, or $1.00 per share. On November 6, 2020, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 2,300,000 shares of our Class B common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.01 per share. On November 27, 2020, 287,500 of such shares were forfeited by the holder thereof. Prior to the initial investment in the Company of $25,000 by our Sponsor, the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. In connection with our Initial Public Offering, our Sponsor sold 20,125 alignment shares and 18,417 private placement warrants (as defined below) to each of our directors (other than Ms. Giamartino and Mr. Sulentic), or their respective designees. In addition, our Sponsor sold 100,625 alignment shares and 36,833 private placement warrants to one of our officers, Cash J. Smith.

 On December 15, 2020 we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 40,250,000 SAILSM (Stakeholder Aligned Initial Listing) securities (the SAILSM securities), including the issuance of 5,250,000 SAILSM securities as a result of the underwriters exercise of its over-allotment option. Each SAILSM security consists of one share of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the Class A common stock), and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant (the Public Warrants), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.00 per share. The SAILSM securities were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per SAILSM security, generating gross proceeds of $402,500,000, including the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. In connection with the consummation of our Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the SAILSM securities, we consummated the private placement of 7,366,667 warrants (the private placement warrants) at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.00 per share, generating total proceeds of approximately $11,050,000. 
 The private placement warrants are substantially similar to the Public Warrants sold as part of the SAILSM securities in the Initial Public Offering, except that if held by our Sponsor, certain directors or officers of the Company or their permitted transferees (i) they will not be redeemable by the Company (except in certain circumstances when the Public Warrants are called for redemption and the $10.00 per share Class A common stock threshold is met, as described in Item 15. Exhibits, and Financial Statement SchedulesExhibit 4.5 Description of Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which is incorporated herein by reference); (ii) they will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the Companys business combination (except, among other limited exceptions, as described in Item 15. Exhibits, and Financial Statement SchedulesExhibit 4.5 Description of Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which is incorporated herein by reference, to the Companys officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with our Sponsor); (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (iv) the private placement warrants (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants) are entitled to certain registration rights. The sale of the private placement warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). 
 On the IPO Closing Date, $402,500,000 of the gross proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (including the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) and the sale of the private placement warrants was deposited in a U.S. based trust account (the trust account), with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company acting as trustee (the Trustee). Of the $11,050,000 held outside of the trust account, $8,050,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions, $215,316 was used to repay notes payable to our Sponsor and the balance was available to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence costs on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. The funds in the trust account have been, and will continue to be, invested only in specified U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations (collectively permitted investments). Funds will remain in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest earned on the funds that may be released to the Company to pay taxes. The proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) (A) to modify the substance or timing of the our obligation to allow redemption in connection with the business combination or to redeem 100% of the public shares if we do not complete the business combination within 24 months (or 27 months from the IPO Closing Date if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for our business combination within 24 months from the IPO Closing Date but have not completed our business combination within such 24-month period) from the IPO Closing Date or (B) with respect to other specified provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of the our public shares if we have not completed the business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date, subject to applicable law. The remaining proceeds outside the trust account may be used to pay business, legal and accounting due diligence costs on prospective acquisitions, listing fees and continuing general and administrative expenses.

 On January 29, 2021, we announced that the holders of our SAILSM securities may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and Public Warrants included in the SAILSM securities commencing on February 1, 2021 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbols CBAH and CBAH WS, respectively. Any SAILSM securities not separated will continue to trade on NYSE under the symbol CBAH.U. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our strategy is to identify and acquire a privately held company with significant growth potential and to create value by supporting the company in the public markets. The company we acquire will operate in an industry that will benefit from the experience, expertise and operating skills of our management team and CBRE. We expect to be a new sponsorship pillar to CBREs build, buy, partner approach to expanding capabilities. We believe this new pillar will support CBREs delivery of innovative solutions to drive exceptional client outcomes. We believe our management team is well positioned to identify and execute a business combination as a preferred partner to a target. In selecting a business combination target, we are leveraging our strengths including: 

 | Aligned Structure. We believe our ability to complete a business combination will be enhanced by how we have structured our Company. The structure of our Company incentivizes our Sponsor, directors and officers to invest in a business where CBRE expects to have a strategic partnership and ties the economic interests of our Sponsor, directors and officers to the long-term performance of the acquired company, not to short-term returns.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Market Intelligence and Industry Expertise. We believe our Sponsor, directors and officers have a deep understanding of the rapidly evolving real estate services landscape and how investor and occupier needs are best met by new and existing services and capabilities as well as opportunities for growth and potential disruption.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Scale to Source Quality Targets. We believe we are positioned to identify and acquire a high-quality target due to our broad knowledge and insight across the real estate landscape, access to CBREs extensive supplier/client network and the business relationships cultivated by CBREs senior leaders around the world. In fact, CBREs top senior leaders are regularly engaged in seeking out attractive acquisitions within our sector.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to Add Strategic Value. We believe we can accelerate a targets growth by facilitating its access to CBREs industry expertise, scale and client and supplier relationships. Our blank-check company has been structured to closely align its interests with CBREs core principles and strategies, which will benefit all stakeholders by creating more alignment among our stockholders, management team and any potential target company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Adept at Structuring Successful Acquisitions. Of the many acquisition opportunities that CBRE evaluates in the course of its business, many attractive targets have business models that do not fit within CBRE as a wholly owned and fully integrated enterprise. Nevertheless, they could benefit from CBREs investment, strategic advice and access to industry expertise and relationships. We believe our Company will be a vehicle for these business models to prosper and reach their full potential.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria 
 Our management team is deploying a proactive, thematic deal sourcing strategy and focusing on companies whose growth potential and value we believe may be enhanced by the combination of our, as well as CBREs, operating experience, deal-making ability and extensive professional relationships, providing opportunities for an attractive return to our stockholders. We are applying the following criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective target businesses. 
 
3 


 
 | A Leading Position in a Segment with Favorable Secular Trends. We are seeking to acquire a business that has a leading or growing position in an industry with favorable underlying secular trends and offers differentiated products or services. These secular trends include the growing adoption of outsourcing among large occupiers and investors in real estate, growing preference for businesses to rely on vendors who can provide end-to-end solutions, the accelerated digitalization of, and data proliferation within, the real estate industry, the growth of institutional investment in commercial real estate, with a corresponding increase in the need for the provision of high-quality services on a regional and global basis, and particularly in the wake of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), an increased focus on services that support employee and tenant health, well-being, engagement and satisfaction.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | An Experienced Growth-Oriented Management Team. We are seeking to acquire a business with a highly capable and talented management team that has a proven record of driving growth and that can benefit from access to capital via the public markets and a strategic relationship with CBRE. We believe that the extensive experience of our officers and directors in identifying and developing executives with leadership potential worldwide within CBRE, as well as the collective mergers and acquisitions experience of our officers and directors, will help us evaluate potential management teams at target companies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Demonstrated Record of Delivering Both Consistent Revenue Growth and Superior Client Outcomes. We are seeking to acquire a business that has historically demonstrated an ability to generate consistently strong revenue growth by satisfying a marketplace need, while also providing products or services that deliver consistently exceptional client outcomes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A Sustainable Market Position. We are seeking to acquire a business that has distinct competitive advantages that provide it with multiple avenues for growth and serve as barriers to entry. For instance, we are particularly focused on businesses that are providing products or services to CBREs client base, have demonstrated an ability to consistently deliver exceptional client outcomes or are positioned to effectively execute innovative or disruptive business models.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Positioned to Benefit from CBREs Strengths. We are seeking to acquire a business that will benefit from CBREs scale, client relationships, management expertise, industry knowledge and breadth of services, all of which will help to bolster its market position and its financial performance. For instance, we believe that there are many potential targets whose businesses could benefit from a strategic vendor relationship, or a highly aligned sales channel partnership, with CBRE.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We anticipate that prospective business targets may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, industry consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Also, members of our management team are communicating with their broad network of professional relationships to articulate our acquisition criteria, including the parameters of our search, and we have begun a disciplined process of reviewing and pursuing promising leads. 
 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. We are willing to accept a high degree of situational, legal and/or capital structure complexity in a business combination if we believe that the potential opportunity justifies this additional complexity, particularly if these issues can be resolved in connection with and as a result of a combination with us. Any evaluation of the merits of a particular business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our officers and directors may deem relevant. 
 Business Combination 
 The NYSE rules require that our business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if any, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our business combination. If our board of directors (the Board) is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the 
 
4 


  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. 
 We anticipate structuring our business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding common stock subsequent to our business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test. 
 Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our business combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that our business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. 
 Our officers and directors may directly or indirectly own shares of our common stock and/or private placement warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our business combination. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity. We expect that if an opportunity is presented to one of our officers or directors in his or her capacity as an officer or director of one of those other entities, such opportunity would be presented to such other entity and not to us. For more information on the entities to which our officers and directors 
 
5 


  currently have fiduciary or contractual obligations, please refer to Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceConflicts of Interest. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. 
 In addition, certain of our directors have fiduciary and contractual duties to CBRE and its affiliates. As a result, certain of our directors will have a duty to offer acquisition opportunities to CBRE and other entities and no duty to offer such opportunities to us unless presented to them in their capacity as our director. As a result, CBRE or any of their respective affiliates may compete with us for acquisition opportunities in the same industries and sectors as we may target for our business combination. If any of them decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within CBRE or any of its affiliates, including by Robert E. Sulentic, William F. Concannon, Cash J. Smith, Emma E. Giamartino and other persons who may make decisions for the Company, may be suitable for both us and for CBRE or any of its affiliates, and will be directed initially to CBRE or such persons rather than to us. None of our officers and directors, CBRE or any of its affiliates or members of our management team who are also employed by CBRE or any of its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware unless it is offered to them solely in their capacity as our director or officer and after they have satisfied their contractual and fiduciary obligations to other parties. CBRE generally intends to offer investment opportunities that fit within the investment program of CBRE to CBRE before offering it to us, and may choose to allocate all or part of any such opportunity to any CBRE affiliate or any business in which a CBRE affiliate has invested instead of offering such opportunity to us. 
 The potential conflicts described above may limit our ability to enter into a business combination or other transactions. CBRE and its affiliates engage, and in the future will engage, in a broad spectrum of activities, including direct investment activities that are independent from, and may from time to time conflict or compete with, our activities. These circumstances could give rise to numerous situations where interests may conflict. There can be no assurance that these or other conflicts of interest with the potential for adverse effects on us and our investors will not arise. 
 In addition, CBRE and its affiliates, including our officers and directors who are affiliated with CBRE, may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking a business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. 
 Additionally, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any alignment shares and any public shares they hold in connection with the consummation of our business combination. Further, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any alignment shares held by them if we fail to complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date. However, if our Sponsor, officers and directors acquire public shares after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time period. If we do not complete our business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, and the private placement warrants will expire worthless. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell (i) any of their alignment shares except to any permitted transferees and (ii) any of their Class A common stock deliverable upon conversion of the alignment shares for 30 days following the completion of our business combination. With certain limited exceptions, the private placement warrants and the Class A common stock underlying such warrants, will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees until 30 days after the completion of our business combination. Since our Sponsor and officers and directors may directly or indirectly own common stock and warrants following the Initial Public Offering, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our business combination.

 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our common stock or for a combination of shares of our common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the June 30th of the prior year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three year period. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the June 30th of the prior year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the June 30th of the prior year. 
 Financial Position 
 With $402,500,000 in gross proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (including the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) and the sale of the private placement warrants available for a business combination, assuming no redemptions and after payment of up to $14,087,500 in deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting our Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds held in the trust account from our Initial Public Offering and sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration. We may seek to complete our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 
7 


 If our business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 Since our Initial Public Offering, we have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination with an operating business, including entering into discussions with potential target businesses, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or had discussions with or with any other target business. We anticipate that additional target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our final prospectus dated December 11, 2020 relating to the Initial Public Offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. 
 There will be no finders fees, reimbursements or cash payments made by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our business combination, other than the reimbursement of any out-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing a business combination, payment to an affiliate of our Sponsor of a total of $10,000 per month for up to 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable), for office space, administrative and support services or the repayment of loans that we may receive from time to time to fund our working capital needs, none of which will be made from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account prior to the completion of our business combination. 
 We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our business combination, and we may effectuate our business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. 
 In the case of a business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with a business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Business Combination 
 The NYSE rules require that our business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if any, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our Board based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 In any case, we will only complete a business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target business sufficient 
 
8 


  for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination. 
 To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

 | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our business combination. 
 Following our business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. 
 Under the NYSEs listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for business combination if, for example: 
 

 | we issue (other than in a public offering for cash) shares of Class A common stock that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers or (b) 5% of the number of shares of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial securityholders; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 

 | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the Company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | other time and budget constraints of the Company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Permitted Purchases of our Securities 
 In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may purchase shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares or warrants such persons may purchase or any restriction on the price that they may pay, which may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a stockholder vote relating to our business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the 
 
10 


  vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which will requires insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information; and (ii) clear all trades with a designated officer prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. 
 In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of such business combination or (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our securities may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors, and/or any of their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our business combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be restricted unless such purchases are made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions totaling $14,087,500 that we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our business combination with respect to our warrants. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any alignment shares and any public shares they hold in connection with the completion of our business combination. 
 Manner of conducting redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. At this time, no such plan currently exists. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares that are not purchased by our Sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such business combination. 
 
12 


 If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration. 
 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination (or, if the applicable rules of the NYSE then in effect require, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock held by public stockholders are voted in favor of the business transaction). Unless restricted by NYSE rules, a quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding capital stock of our Company entitled to vote at such a meeting. Unless restricted by NYSE rules, our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum. Pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any alignment shares and any public shares they hold in favor of our business combination. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our business combination, our Sponsor, directors and officers and their respective permitted transferees will own approximately 5% of our outstanding common stock but will be entitled to 20% of the voting power of our common stock prior to our business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds and the letter agreement may make it more likely that we will consummate our business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any alignment shares and any public shares they hold in connection with the completion of a business combination. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules ). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternative business combination. 
 Limitation on redemption upon completion of our business combination if we seek stockholder approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and 
 
13 


  restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares of Class A common stock sold in our Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our Sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us or our Sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have, pursuant to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any alignment shares or public shares redeemed in connection with our business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires alignment shares through a permitted transfer from an initial stockholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares through open market purchases, it would be a public stockholder and subject to the 15% limitation in connection with any such redemption right. 
 Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights 
 We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, rather than simply voting against the business combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on a business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the Company would contact such stockholder to 
 
14 


  arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the Companys shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the Company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination. 
 If our business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date. 
 Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no business combination 
 We have only 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date to complete our business combination. If we have not completed our business combination within such 24-month period (or 27-month period, as applicable), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a business combination within the 24-month time period (or 27-month time period, as applicable). 
 Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their alignment shares if we fail to complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date. However, if our Sponsor, officers and directors acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the allotted 24-month time period (or 27-month time period, as applicable). 
 Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date or (B) with respect to other specified provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the 
 
15 


  aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $625,916 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2020), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the Trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all third parties, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. 
 In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not completed our business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. Our Sponsor may not have sufficient funds available to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by third parties and prospective target businesses.

 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we have not completed our business combination within such 24-month period (or 27-month period, as applicable), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month (or 27th month, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we have and will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to 
 
17 


  the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our business combination, and then only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder properly elected to redeem; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date or (B) with respect to other specified provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity; and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our business combination, a stockholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. 
 Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our Initial Public Offering that apply to us until the completion of our business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date or stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any alignment shares and any public shares they hold in connection with the consummation of our business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: 

 | prior to the consummation of our business combination, we shall either (i) seek stockholder approval of our business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our business combination, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in our trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in our trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
18 


 
 | we will consummate our business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | if we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as applicable) from the IPO Closing Date, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in our trust account; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prior to our business combination, we may not issue additional shares of common stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from our trust account or (ii) vote on any business combination.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of at least 65% of our common stock. If we seek stockholder approval in connection with our business combination, we will complete our business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. 
 Competition 
 We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, private and public operating companies and strategic buyers, other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination within the required time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.00 per share upon our liquidation. 
Conflicts of Interest 
 Certain of our directors and officers have fiduciary and contractual duties to CBRE and its affiliates. As a result, certain of our directors and officers will have a duty to offer acquisition opportunities to CBRE and other entities and no duty to offer such opportunities to us unless presented to them in their capacity as our director or officer. As a result, CBRE or any of their respective affiliates may compete with us for acquisition opportunities in the same industries and sectors as we may target for our business combination. If any of them decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within CBRE or any of its affiliates, including by Robert E. Sulentic, William F. Concannon, Cash J. Smith, Emma E. Giamartino and other persons who may make decisions for the Company, may be suitable for both us and for CBRE or any of its affiliates, and will be directed initially to CBRE or such persons rather than to us. Our officers and directors, CBRE or any of its affiliates or members of our management team who are also employed by CBRE or any of its affiliates do not have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware unless it is offered to them solely in their capacity as our director or officer and after they have satisfied their contractual and fiduciary obligations to other parties. CBRE generally intends to offer investment opportunities that fit within the investment program of CBRE to CBRE before offering it to us, and may choose to allocate all or part of any such opportunity to any CBRE affiliate or any business in which a CBRE affiliate has invested instead of offering such opportunity to us. 
 
19 


 The potential conflicts described above may limit our ability to enter into a business combination or other transactions. CBRE and its affiliates engage, and in the future will engage, in a broad spectrum of activities, including direct investment activities that are independent from, and may from time to time conflict or compete with, our activities. These circumstances could give rise to numerous situations where interests may conflict. There can be no assurance that these or other conflicts of interest with the potential for adverse effects on us and our investors will not arise. 
 In addition, CBRE and its affiliates, including our officers and directors who are affiliated with CBRE, may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking a business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity. We expect that if an opportunity is presented to one of our officers or directors in his or her capacity as an officer or director of one of those other entities, such opportunity would be presented to such other entity and not to us. For more information on the entities to which our officers and directors currently have fiduciary or contractual obligations, please refer to Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceConflicts of Interest. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. 
 Employees 
 We currently have two officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our business combination. 
 Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our business combination. The amount of time that members of our management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our SAILSM securities, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and as a result we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. Our annual, quarterly and current reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable through our corporate website address at https://cbreacquisitionholdings.com. The contents of this website is not incorporated into this filing. Further, our references to the uniform resource locators, or URLs, for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) or International Financing Reporting Standards, as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS), depending on the 
 
20 


  circumstances and the historical financial statements that may be required to be audited in accordance with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 In connection with our Initial Public Offering, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our business combination. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the June 30th of the prior year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the June 30th of the prior year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the June 30th of the prior year.
