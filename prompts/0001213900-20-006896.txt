ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to LGL Systems Acquisition Corp.
 
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 30, 2019. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we are currently focusing our search for target businesses in the defense, aerospace and communication industries.
 
On November 12, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 17,250,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, which included the full exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 2,250,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of $172,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 5,200,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant in a private placement to LGL Systems Acquisition Holding Company, LLC (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $5,200,000.
 
On December 20, 2019, we received a delisting letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). We appealed the delisting letter to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (“Panel”) and on February 12, 2020, the Panel issued its decision (“Decision”) to grant our request for continued listing, based on its finding that we had met the requirements for listing on Nasdaq. The Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council may, on its own motion, determine to review the Decision until March 28, 2020. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective March 13, 2020, we transferred the listing of our securities to the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are now listed on the NYSE under the symbols “DFNS.U,” “DFNS” and “DFNS WS,” respectively.
 
For further details regarding our business, see the section titled “Proposed Business” contained in our prospectus dated November 6, 2019, incorporated by reference herein.
