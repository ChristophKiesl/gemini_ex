Item 1. Business 
Introduction 
 
Jensyn Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 8, 2014 as a blank check company whose objective is to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses (a “Business Combination”). At December 31, 2016, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through December 31, 2016 relates to the Company’s formation, the public offering described below, and search for an acquisition target.
Company History 
 
On March 7, 2016, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) of 3,900,000 units (“Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one right (“Right”) to purchase one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon consummation of an initial business combination (a “Business Combination”) and one warrant (“Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per full share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $39,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 275,000 Units to Jensyn Capital, LLC, an entity controlled by our insiders, and 19,500 Units to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, the representative of the underwriters of the Public Offering (“Chardan”), at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,945,000. The Units issued to Jensyn Capital, LLC and Chardan (the “Private Units”) consist of one share of Common Stock (“Private Shares”), one Right (“Private Right”) to purchase one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon consummation of a Business Combination and one Warrant (“Private Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per full share.
 
A total of $40,365,000 of the net proceeds from the Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Trust Account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes, none of the funds held in the Trust Account will be released until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the redemption of 100% of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to consummate a Business Combination within the required timeframe.

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 
General 
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time following the Public Offering. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial Business Combination. Our initial Business Combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a Business Combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous Business Combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single Business Combination.
Sources of Target Businesses 
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus associated with our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition to our engagement of Chardan described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we may engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions or mergers in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will any of the members of our management team be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have no present intention to enter into a Business Combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or insiders. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (1) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) and (2) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 
Subject to our management team’s fiduciary duties and the limitation that one or more target businesses have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Additionally, there is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial Business Combination. Our efforts to identify a target business are not limited to a particular industry or geographic area. Although our initial efforts were focused on the information technology consulting industry we will consider opportunities in other industries.
 
We believe that the acquisition and operation of an established business will provide a foundation from which to build a diversified business platform. We would prefer to acquire a target business that provides an opportunity for platform growth, has an experienced and motivated management team, recurring revenues, a strong client base and a history of profitable growth. At this juncture, however, we are not limiting our search to target businesses that have historical revenues and earnings over any specific level and would take into account prospects for future growth and unique market opportunities in evaluating acquisition targets.
 
Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 

● | financial condition and results of operation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential; 


2
-


● | brand recognition and potential; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | return on equity or invested capital; 
● | market capitalization or enterprise value; 
● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
● | potential to expand geographic presence, client base and/or product and service offerings; 
● | capital requirements; 
● | competitive position; 
● | barriers to entry; 
● | stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
● | existing distribution and potential for expansion; 
● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; 
● | impact of regulation on the business; 
● | regulatory environment of the industry; 
● | costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and 
● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Our management may not consider any of the above criteria in evaluating a prospective target business. The retention of our current officers and directors following the completion of any business combination will not be a material consideration in our evaluation of a prospective target business.
 
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a Business Combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination remain to be determined. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a Business Combination.

Fair Market Value of Target Business 
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, our initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination, although we may structure a Business Combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the Trust Account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a Business Combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a Business Combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns or acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific Business Combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. However, if we seek to consummate an initial Business Combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or insiders and are therefore required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the Business Combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view, we may ask that banking firm to opine on whether the target business met the 80% fair market value test. Nevertheless, we are not required to do so and could determine not to do so without consent of our stockholders.
Stockholder Approval of Business Combination 
 
In connection with any proposed Business Combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders (but not our insiders, officers or directors) may seek to convert their shares of Common Stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and therefore avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. We anticipate that our business combination could be completed by way of a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar transaction. Stockholder approval will not be required under Delaware law if the business combination is structured as an acquisition of assets of the target company, a share exchange with target company shareholders or a purchase of stock of the target company; however, Nasdaq rules would require us to obtain stockholder approval if we seek to issue shares representing 20% or more of our outstanding shares as consideration in a business combination. A merger of our company into a target company would require stockholder approval under Delaware law. A merger of a target company into our company would not require stockholder approval unless the merger results in a change to our certificate of incorporation, or if the shares issued in connection with the merger exceed 20% of our outstanding shares prior to the merger. A merger of a target company with a subsidiary of our company would not require stockholder approval unless the merger results in a change in our certificate of incorporation; however, Nasdaq rules would require us to obtain stockholder approval of such a transaction if we seek to issue shares representing 20% or more of our outstanding shares as consideration.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will provide our stockholders with an opportunity to tender their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules.
 
In the event we allow stockholders to tender their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules, our tender offer will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not purchase public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or Nasdaq requirements, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will:
 

● | permit stockholders to convert their shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 

 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide stockholders with the conversion rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
We will consummate our initial Business Combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. As a result, if stockholders owning approximately 83.4% or more of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering exercise conversion rights, the Business Combination will not be consummated. However, the actual percentages will only be able to be determined once a target business is located and we can assess all of the assets and liabilities of the combined company (which would include the fee payable to Chardan in an amount equal to 2.0% of the total gross proceeds raised in the Public Offering as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, less up to 30% of such fee that we may allocate to one or more other advisors that assist us in identifying or consummating an initial Business Combination, any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and Business Combinations that have not been repaid at that time, as well as any other liabilities of ours and the liabilities of the target business) upon consummation of the proposed Business Combination, subject to the requirement that we must have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets upon closing of such Business Combination. As a result, the actual percentages of shares that can be converted may be significantly lower than our estimates. We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial Business Combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the Trust Account upon consummation of such initial Business Combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial Business Combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Alternatively, we may not be able to consummate a Business Combination unless the number of shares of Common Stock seeking conversion rights is significantly less than the 83.4% indicated above. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering if the period of time in which we can complete a Business Combination has been extended by the full amount, as described below) in order to be able to receive a portion of the Trust Account.
 
Our insiders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of Common Stock owned by them in favor of any proposed Business Combination, (2) not to convert any shares of Common Stock into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity or (3) not sell any shares of Common Stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial Business Combination.
 
None of our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase Units or shares of Common Stock in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed Business Combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed Business Combination, our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of Common Stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
 
Conversion Rights 
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial Business Combination, any public stockholder, whether voting for or against such proposed Business Combination, will be entitled to demand that his or her shares of Common Stock be converted for a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.35 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our Common Stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or hers, or any other person with whom he or she is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 20% or more of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering. Such a public stockholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed Business Combination with respect to all shares of Common Stock owned by him or her, or his or her affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed Business Combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a stockholder’s ability to convert no more than 20% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which is favored by our other public stockholders.
 
None of our insiders, officers or directors will have the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity with respect to any shares of Common Stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the Offering or purchased by them in the Offering or in the aftermarket.
 
We may also require public stockholders who wish to convert, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement through the vote on the Business Combination to deliver his or her shares if he or she wishes to seek to exercise his or her conversion rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a public stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise conversion rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver shares to exercise conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the proposed Business Combination and the proposed Business Combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his or her shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed Business Combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his or her certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the proposed Business Combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he or she may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination
 
If we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial Business Combination within 18 months of the closing of the Public Offering, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 24 months after the closing of the Public Offering to complete a business combination). Our ability to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial Business Combination is conditioned upon the deposit by our initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees into the Trust Account of $200,000 prior to the applicable deadline for each three-month extension. Our initial stockholders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our initial Business Combination.
 
The factors that we will consider in determining whether we extend the period during which may complete a Business Combination will likely include:
 

● | the status of discussions and negotiations with potential acquisition targets; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | management’s assessment of the likelihood of completing a Business Combination within the extension period; 
● | the costs then incurred to date in pursuing a Business Combination and the funds then remaining available outside the Trust Account; and 
● | the willingness of our initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees to deposit additional funds in the Trust Account. 

 
The $200,000 deposit required to extend the period during which we may complete a Business Combination must be deposited into the Trust Account no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the initial 18 month period or the initial extension period, as applicable. If we extend the period during which we can complete a Business Combination, we will issue a press release no later than 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the first business day after the expiration of the initial 18 month period or initial extension period, as applicable. For these purposes, a business day means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or U.S. federal holiday. We do not anticipate that disclosure of the factors giving rise to the extension will be provided in any such extension announcement.
 
Liquidation if No Business Combination 
 
If we do not complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to a total of 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering if the period of time in which we can complete a Business Combination has been extended by the full amount), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At such time, the Rights and Warrants will expire, holders of Rights and Warrants will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect to such Rights and Warrants, respectively, and the Rights and Warrants will be worthless. If we do not complete a Business Combination within the required time period, only holders of shares issued in our Public Offering will be entitled to receive redemption proceeds from the Trust Account, and it is likely that shares initially issued in private transactions will be worthless. 
Competition 
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could complete a Business Combination with utilizing the net proceeds of the Public Offering, our ability to compete in completing a Business Combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to convert shares of Common Stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination; 
● | our outstanding Rights, Warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent; 
● | our obligation to ensure that if we enter into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which we will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the Common Stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into Common Stock basis (for instance, if the Business Combination would result in each share of Common Stock outstanding being exchanged for two shares of Common Stock, each right would result in the holder receiving two-tenths (2/10) of a share of Common Stock upon consummation of such Business Combination); 


7
-


● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to Chardan upon consummation of our initial Business Combination; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to either repay or issue Private Units upon conversion of up to $1,700,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates; 
● | our obligation to register the resale of the shares of our Common Stock held by our insiders and their transferees (the “Insider Shares”), as well as the Private Units (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and 
● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a Business Combination. 

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial Business Combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an initial Business Combination with a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting our initial Business Combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to our initial Business Combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Facilities 
 
We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 800 West Main Street, Suite 204, Freehold, New Jersey 07728. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee (subject to deferral as described herein) payable to Jensyn Integration Services, LLC, a company controlled by our insiders, for office space, utilities and secretarial services. Our agreement with Jensyn Integration Services, LLC provides that commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and until we consummate a Business Combination, such office space, as well as utilities and secretarial services, will be made available to us as may be required from time to time. We believe that the fee charged by Jensyn Integration Services, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.

We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process the Company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to consummate our initial Business Combination has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the Business Combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote an average of approximately 10 hours per week to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to consummation of our initial Business Combination.
