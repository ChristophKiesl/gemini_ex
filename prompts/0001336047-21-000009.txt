Item 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms refer to the business of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Introduction
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2005. Our business, which is conducted by our primary subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipelines, LP (Boardwalk Pipelines) and its operating subsidiaries (together, the operating subsidiaries), consists of integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids and other hydrocarbons (herein referred to together as NGLs) pipeline and storage systems. All of our operations are conducted by the operating subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Loews Corporation (Loews), owned directly or indirectly, 100% of our capital.
Our Business
We operate in the midstream portion of the natural gas and NGLs industry, providing transportation and storage for those commodities. We own approximately 14,095 miles of natural gas and NGLs pipelines and underground storage caverns having aggregate capacity of approximately 213.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas and 32.1 million barrels (MMBbls) of NGLs. Our natural gas pipeline systems are located in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma, Arkansas and the Midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and our NGLs pipelines and storage facilities are located in Louisiana and Texas. 
We serve a broad mix of customers, including local distribution companies (LDCs), electric power generators, exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG), industrial users, producers and marketers of natural gas, and interstate and intrastate pipelines. We provide a significant portion of our natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services through firm contracts under which our customers pay monthly capacity reservation fees, which are fixed fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved, regardless of use. Other fees are based on actual utilization of the capacity under firm contracts and contracts for interruptible services. Contracts for our NGLs services are generally fee-based or based on minimum volume requirements, while others are dependent on actual volumes transported or stored. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 90% of our revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees under firm contracts, approximately 6% of our revenues were derived from fees based on utilization under firm contracts and approximately 4% of our revenues were derived from interruptible transportation, interruptible storage, parking and lending (PAL) and other services.

The maximum rates we can charge for most of our natural gas transportation services, as well as the general terms and conditions of those services, are established by, and subject to review and revision by, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These rates are based upon certain assumptions to allow us the opportunity to recover the cost of providing these services and earn a reasonable return on equity. However, it is possible that we may not recover all of our costs or earn a return. We are authorized to charge market-based rates for the majority of our natural gas storage capacity pursuant to authority granted by the FERC. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) regulates the rates we charge for interstate service on ethylene pipelines. The Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) regulates the rates we charge for intrastate service within the state of Louisiana on our petrochemical and NGLs pipelines. The STB and LPSC require that our transportation rates are reasonable and that our practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among our shippers.
Our Pipeline and Storage Systems
We own and operate approximately 13,650 miles of interconnected natural gas pipelines, directly serving customers in thirteen states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States (U.S.) through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. We also own and operate approximately 445 miles of NGLs pipelines in Louisiana and Texas. In 2020, our pipeline systems transported approximately 3.2 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas and approximately 80.6 MMBbls of NGLs. Average daily throughput on our natural gas pipeline systems during 2020 was approximately 8.6 Bcf. Our natural gas storage facilities are comprised of fourteen underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 213.0 Bcf and our NGLs storage facilities consist of eleven salt-dome caverns located in Louisiana with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 32.1 MMBbls. We also own seven salt-dome caverns and related brine infrastructure for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGLs storage operations. 
The principal sources of supply for our natural gas pipeline systems are regional supply hubs and market centers located in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions, including offshore Louisiana, the Perryville, Louisiana, area, the Henry Hub in Louisiana and the Carthage, Texas, area. Our pipelines in the Carthage, Texas, area provide access to natural gas supplies from the Barnett and Haynesville Shales and other natural gas producing regions in eastern Texas and northern Louisiana. The Henry Hub serves as the designated delivery point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Our pipeline systems also have access to supply basins such as the Woodford and Scoop/Stack Shales in Oklahoma, the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas and wellhead supplies in northern and southern Louisiana and Mississippi, and we also receive gas in the Lebanon, Ohio, area from the Marcellus and Utica Shales located in the northeastern U.S. Our NGLs pipeline systems access the Gulf Coast petrochemical industry through our operations at our Choctaw Hub in the Mississippi River corridor area of Louisiana and the Sulphur Hub in the Lake Charles, Louisiana, area. We also access ethylene supplies at Port Neches, Texas, which we deliver to petrochemical-industry customers in Louisiana.
The following is a summary of each of our principal operating subsidiaries:
Gulf South Pipeline Company, LLC (Gulf South): Effective January 1, 2020, Gulf South converted from a limited partnership to a limited liability company. Immediately subsequent to the conversion, our Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, operating subsidiary was merged into Gulf South. Our merged Gulf South pipeline system is located along the Gulf Coast in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. The on-system markets directly served by the Gulf South system are generally located in eastern Texas, Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Gulf South also services the Perryville Exchange. These markets include LNG export markets in the Freeport, Texas, area, power plants, LDCs and municipalities located across the system, including New Orleans, Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; Houston, Texas; and Pensacola, Florida, and other end-users located across the system, including the Baton Rouge to New Orleans industrial corridor and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Gulf South also has indirect access to off-system markets through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities. These pipeline interconnections provide access to markets throughout the northeastern, midwestern and southeastern U.S. 
Gulf South has ten natural gas storage facilities. The two natural gas storage facilities located in Bistineau, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, have approximately 91.5 Bcf of working gas storage capacity from which Gulf South offers firm and interruptible storage service, including no-notice service (NNS), and are used to support pipeline operations. Gulf South also owns and operates eight high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage caverns in Forrest County, Mississippi, having approximately 46.0 Bcf of total storage capacity, of which approximately 29.6 Bcf is working gas capacity, and owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to five additional storage caverns. 
Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (Texas Gas): Our Texas Gas pipeline system is a bi-directional pipeline located in Louisiana, East Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. Texas Gas directly serves LDCs, municipalities and power generators in its market area, which encompasses eight states in the South and Midwest and includes the Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio; and Evansville and Indianapolis, Indiana, metropolitan areas. Texas Gas also has indirect market access to, and receives supply from, the Northeast through interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. A large portion of the gas delivered by the Texas Gas system is used for heating during the winter months, but Texas Gas also supplies gas for cooling needs during the summer months. 
Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields, of which it owns the majority of the working and base gas. Texas Gas uses this gas to meet the operational requirements of its transportation and storage customers and the requirements of its NNS customers. Texas Gas also uses its storage capacity to offer firm and interruptible storage services.
Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC and Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline, LLC (collectively, Louisiana Midstream): Louisiana Midstream provides transportation and storage services for natural gas, NGLs and ethylene, fractionation services for NGLs and brine supply services for producers and consumers of petrochemicals through two hubs in southern Louisiana - the Choctaw Hub in the Mississippi River corridor area and the Sulphur Hub in the Lake Charles area. These assets provide approximately 48.8 MMBbls of salt-dome storage capacity, including approximately 7.6 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity; significant brine supply infrastructure; and approximately 285 miles of pipeline assets, including an extensive ethylene distribution system. Louisiana Midstream also owns and operates the Evangeline Pipeline, an approximately 175-mile interstate ethylene pipeline that is capable of transporting approximately 4.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year between Port Neches, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with interconnections with the ethylene distribution system and storage facilities at the Sulphur and Choctaw Hubs. Throughput for Louisiana Midstream was 80.6 MMBbls for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Boardwalk Texas Intrastate, LLC (Boardwalk Texas Intrastate): Boardwalk Texas Intrastate provides intrastate natural gas transportation services on pipelines located in South Texas extending on the west side from Bee County, near the Eagle Ford Shale, and Agua Dulce to the Corpus Christi area and to an interconnect with Gulf South in Jackson County, Texas. Boardwalk Texas Intrastate is situated to provide access to industrial and power generation markets in the Corpus Christi area as well as LNG export markets and third-party pipelines for exports to Mexico.

The following table provides information for our pipeline and storage systems as of February 9, 2021:

Current Growth Projects
In 2020, we placed into service approximately $335.0 million of growth projects which represents approximately 1.5 Bcf/d of firm natural gas transportation capacity and additional NGL infrastructure. Additionally, we expanded our natural gas storage capacity at our Forrest County, Mississippi, storage facilities. Collectively, these projects were completed on-time and within budget. We expect to spend approximately $380.0 million on our growth projects currently under construction through 2024. Those projects are expected to serve increased natural gas demand from a power generation plant and liquids demand from petrochemical facilities. All of our growth projects are secured by long-term firm contracts.

Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of capital expenditures and financing.
Nature of Contracts

We contract with our customers to provide transportation and storage services on both a firm and interruptible basis. We also provide bundled firm transportation and storage services, such as NNS, interruptible PAL services for our customers, brine supply services for certain petrochemical customers and fractionation services.
Transportation Services: We offer transportation services on both a firm and interruptible basis. Our customers choose, based upon their particular needs, the applicable mix of services depending upon availability of pipeline capacity, the price of services and the volume and timing of customer requirements. Our firm transportation customers reserve a specific amount of pipeline capacity at specified receipt and delivery points on our system. The transaction price for firm service contracts is comprised of a fixed fee based on the quantity of capacity reserved, regardless of use (capacity reservation fee), plus variable fees in the form of a usage fee paid on the volume of commodity actually transported or injected and withdrawn from storage. Capacity reservation revenues derived from a firm service contract are generally consistent during the contract term, but can be higher in winter periods than the rest of the year, especially for NNS agreements. Firm transportation contracts can range from one to twenty years, although we may enter into shorter- or longer-term contracts. In providing interruptible services to customers, we agree to transport natural gas or NGLs for a customer when capacity is available. Interruptible service customers pay a commodity charge only for the volume of gas actually transported, plus a fuel charge. Interruptible transportation agreements have terms ranging from day-to-day to multiple years, with rates that change on a daily, monthly or seasonal basis. Our NGLs transportation services are generally fee-based or based on minimum volume requirements.
Storage and Parking and Lending Services: We offer natural gas and NGLs storage services on both a firm and interruptible basis. Firm storage customers reserve a specific amount of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, while interruptible customers receive storage capacity and injection and withdrawal rights when available. Similar to firm transportation customers, firm storage customers generally pay fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved plus an injection and withdrawal fee. Firm storage contracts typically range in term from one to ten years. Interruptible storage customers pay for the volume of gas actually stored plus injection and withdrawal fees. Generally, interruptible storage 
agreements are for monthly terms. We are able to charge market-based rates for the majority of our natural gas storage capacity pursuant to authority granted by the FERC. Our NGLs storage rates are market-based, and the contracts for NGLs services are typically fixed-price arrangements with escalation clauses. PAL is an interruptible service offered to customers providing them the ability to park (inject) or borrow (withdraw) natural gas into or out of our pipeline systems at a specific location for a specific period of time. Customers pay for PAL services in advance or on a monthly basis depending on the terms of the agreement.
No-Notice Services: NNS consist of a combination of firm natural gas transportation and storage services that allow customers to inject or withdraw natural gas from storage with little or no notice. Customers pay a reservation charge based upon the capacity reserved plus a commodity and a fuel charge based on the volume of gas actually transported. In accordance with its tariff, Texas Gas loans stored gas to certain of its no-notice customers who are obligated to repay the gas in-kind.
Customers and Markets Served
We contract directly with end-use customers, including LDCs, electric power generators, exporters of LNG and industrial users, with producers and marketers of natural gas, and with interstate and intrastate pipelines, who, in turn, provide transportation and storage services for end-users. Based on our 2020 transportation, storage and PAL revenues, net of fuel, our customer mix was as follows: marketers (22%), power generators (22%), natural gas producers (19%), LDCs (16%), industrial end-users (12%) and exporters of LNG (9%). Based upon our 2020 transportation, storage and PAL revenues, net of fuel, our deliveries were as follows: pipeline interconnects (32%), LDCs (19%), power generators (16%), industrial end-users (14%), storage activities (9%), exporters of LNG (9%) and others (1%). One customer comprised approximately 10% of our operating revenues in 2020.
Marketers: Natural gas marketing companies utilize our services to provide services to our other customer groups as well as to customer groups in off-system markets. The services may include combined gas transportation and storage services to support the needs of the other customer groups. Some of the marketers are sponsored by LDCs or producers.
Power Generators: Our natural gas pipelines are directly connected to 45 natural-gas-fired power generation facilities in nine states. The demand of the power generating customers generally peaks during the summer cooling season which is counter to the winter season peak demands of the LDCs, although demand from power generators remains strong in the winter months as well, due to the overall increase in the use of natural gas over other sources, such as coal, to generate electricity. Our power generating customers can use a combination of NNS, firm and interruptible transportation services.
Natural Gas Producers: Producers of natural gas use our services to transport gas supplies from producing areas, including shale natural gas production areas, to supply pools and to other customers on and off of our systems. Producers contract with us for storage services to store excess production and to optimize the ultimate sales prices for their gas.
Local Distribution Companies: Most of our LDC customers use firm natural gas transportation services, including NNS. We serve approximately 175 LDCs at more than 300 delivery locations across our pipeline systems. The demand of these customers peaks during the winter heating season.
Industrial End-Users: We provide approximately 186 industrial facilities with a combination of firm and interruptible natural gas and NGLs transportation and storage services. Our pipeline systems are directly connected to industrial facilities in the Baton Rouge to New Orleans industrial corridor; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida. We can also access the Houston Ship Channel through third-party natural gas pipelines.
Exporters of LNG: LNG exporters use our firm transportation services to reach LNG liquefaction and export facilities. We provide 1.4 Bcf/d of firm natural gas transportation service directly to the Freeport LNG liquefaction and export facility in Freeport, Texas.
Our delivery market has diversified over time, with increased deliveries to our end-use customers, whereas historically, our delivery markets were primarily to other pipelines who then delivered to the end-use customers. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $9.5 billion of projected operating revenues under committed firm transportation agreements, of which our deliveries are expected to be as follows: power generators (30%), exporters of LNG (22%), pipeline interconnects (21%) industrial end-users (13%), LDCs (8%), storage activities (5%) and others (1%).
Government Regulation 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: The FERC regulates our interstate natural gas transmission operating subsidiaries under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). The FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the construction, extension, enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction. Where required, our interstate natural gas pipeline subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC covering certain of their facilities, activities and services. The FERC also prescribes accounting treatment for our interstate natural gas pipeline subsidiaries which is separately reported pursuant to forms filed with the FERC. The regulatory books and records and other activities of our subsidiaries that operate under the FERC's jurisdiction may be periodically audited by the FERC.
The maximum rates that our FERC-regulated operating subsidiaries may charge for all aspects of the natural gas transportation services they provide are established through the FERC's cost-based rate-making process. Key determinants in the FERC's cost-based rate-making process are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. The maximum rates that may be charged by us for storage services on Texas Gas, except for services associated with a portion of the working gas capacity on that system, are also established through the FERC's cost-based rate-making process. The FERC has authorized us to charge market-based rates for firm and interruptible storage services for the majority of our other natural gas storage facilities. None of our FERC-regulated entities currently have an obligation to file a new rate case, and Gulf South is prohibited from filing a rate case until May 1, 2023, subject to certain exceptions.
Boardwalk Texas Intrastate transports natural gas in intrastate commerce under the rules and regulations established by the Texas Railroad Commission and in interstate commerce that is subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA. The maximum rates for services are established under Section 311 of the NGPA and are generally subject to review every five years by the FERC. 
Surface Transportation Board and Louisiana Public Service Commission: The STB regulates the rates we charge for interstate service on our ethylene pipelines. The LPSC regulates the rates we charge for intrastate service within the state of Louisiana on our petrochemical and NGL pipelines. The STB and LPSC require that our transportation rates are reasonable and that our practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among our shippers.
U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT): We are regulated by the DOT, through the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA), under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (NGPSA), and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (HLPSA). The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of interstate natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. We have authority from PHMSA to operate certain natural gas pipeline assets under issued permits with specific conditions that allow us to operate those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipeline's Specified Minimum Yield Strength (SMYS). Operating at these pressures allows us to transport all the existing natural gas volumes we have contracted for on those facilities with our customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for us to operate our natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures and, in the event that PHMSA should elect not to allow us to operate at these higher pressures, it could affect our ability to transport all of our contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipeline assets, and we could incur significant additional costs to reinstate this authority or to develop alternate ways to meet our contractual obligations. PHMSA's regulations also require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas, known as high consequence areas (HCAs), high population areas (also known as moderate consequence areas (MCAs)), and Class 3 and Class 4 areas, which are determined by specific population densities near our pipelines, as well as certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas, along our pipelines, and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. 
Legislation in the past decade has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. In particular, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Act) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Act). The 2011 Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. The 2016 Act, among other things, required PHMSA to complete its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Act and develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. Pursuant to the 2016 Act, PHMSA published a final rule in February 2020 that amended the minimum safety issues related to natural gas storage facilities, including wells, wellbore tubing and casing, which final rule was amended to add applicable reporting requirements and was subsequently published in July 2020. Also, in October 2019, PHMSA published the first of three expected regulations relating to new or more stringent 
requirements for certain natural gas pipelines, that had originally been proposed in 2016 as part of PHMSA's “gas Mega Rule,” which first final rule became effective on July 1, 2020. This regulation imposed numerous requirements, including maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) reconfirmation through re-verification of all historical records for pipelines in service, which re-certification process may require natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 (previously excluded from certain pressure testing obligations) to be pressure tested, the periodic assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs (in MCAs as well as Class 3 and Class 4 areas), the reporting of exceedances of MAOP and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. Additional amendments to this October 2019 final rule relating to recordkeeping for gas transmission lines were published by PHMSA in July 2020. We are currently evaluating the operational and financial impact related to this final rule. The remaining rulemakings comprising the gas Mega Rule have not yet been published, and we cannot predict when they will be finalized; however, they are expected to include revised pipeline repair criteria as well as more stringent corrosion control requirements. 
Also, in the Fiscal Year 2021 Omnibus Appropriations Bill passed by Congress and made effective December 27, 2020, the Congress reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several regulatory actions, including the “Pipeline Safety: Class Location Change Requirements” and the “Pipeline Safety: Safety of Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipelines” proposed rulemakings. Congress has also instructed PHMSA to issue final regulations that will require operators of non-rural gas gathering lines and new and existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to conduct certain leak detection and repair programs and to require facility inspection and maintenance plans to align with those regulations. New regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.
Other: Our operations are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and safety. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of various substances, including hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that our facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Occupational health and safety regulations establish standards protective of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. These laws, as amended from time to time, that our operations are subject to, include, for example:
•the Clean Air Act (CAA) and analogous state laws, which regulate air emission pollutants, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reciprocating engines subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards;
•the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws, which establish the extent to which waterways are subject to federal or state jurisdiction and serve to regulate the discharge of wastewater from our facilities into state and federal waters;
•the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly referred to as CERCLA, or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent hazardous substances for disposal;
•the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes at or from our facilities;
•the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats by the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal or permanent ban in affected areas;
•the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment; and
•the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and analogous state laws, which establish workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances and appropriate control measures.
Many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental or occupational health and safety legal requirements governing many of the same types of activities, and those requirements can be more stringent than those adopted under federal laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these federal, state and local laws and regulations may result 
in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of delays, denials or cancellations in permitting or the development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in affected areas. 
President Biden has indicated that he intends to pursue additional environmental regulations, whether by new legislation, executive actions or regulatory initiatives, which may impact our operations. For example, in recent years, there have been conflicting interpretations of what waterways are subject to jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, with competing rulemakings being developed, and subsequently challenged in courts, by different presidential administrations. The incoming Biden Administration may propose another interpretation of the extent of this jurisdiction, though we cannot predict the likelihood or effects of any such proposal at this time. Similarly, President Biden has announced plans to take action with regards to climate change and signed executive orders to this effect on January 20, 2021; for more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors—Business Risks—Legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change make our operations, as well as the operations of our fossil-fuel producer customers, subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.

Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, but there can be no assurance that future compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us or that the current regulatory standards will not become more onerous in the future, resulting in more significant costs to maintain compliance or increased exposure to significant liabilities. Note 5 in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains information regarding environmental compliance.
Human Capital

At December 31, 2020, we had 1,240 employees, approximately 100 of whom were included under collective bargaining agreements. A satisfactory relationship exists between management and labor.
Hiring and retaining the right people is critical to our long-term strategic success. We have programs in place to help employees build their knowledge, skills and experience, as well as to guide their career development. A cornerstone of our human capital strategy is our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment, where all people are respected and encouraged to contribute their ideas. Employing individuals with different backgrounds and experiences helps meet the diverse needs of all our stakeholders.
We are part of a critical infrastructure industry whose customers and communities depend upon us to provide safe and reliable service. Our employees are essential to ensuring we continue to meet these objectives, and we consider safety in our day-to-day activities to be our primary core value. Our emphasis on safety extends to our approach to managing the risk of operational disruptions due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and we have maintained full, continuous operations throughout the pandemic.
