Our Strategy and Outlook
 
XpresSpa
 
We acquired XpresSpa on December 23, 2016. XpresSpa is a leading airport retailer of spa services and related products. It is a well-recognized and popular airport spa brand with approximately 50% market share in the United States and nearly three times the number of domestic locations as its closest competitor. It provides nearly 700,000 services per year. As of December 31, 2016, XpresSpa operated 53 total locations in 40 terminals and 22 airports in three countries, the United States, Netherlands, and United Arab Emirates. XpresSpa also sells wellness and travel products through its internet site, www.xpresspa.com. Key services and products include:

• | massage services for the neck, back, feet and whole body;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | nail care, such as pedicures, manicures and polish changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | travel products such as neck pillows, blankets, massage tools and eye masks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For over a decade, increased security requirements have led travelers to spend more time at the airport. In addition, in anticipation of the long and often stressful security lines, travelers allow for more time to get through security and, as a result, often experience increased downtime prior to boarding. Consequentially, travelers at large airport hubs spend approximately 75 minutes in the terminal after passing through security.


XpresSpa was developed to address the stress and idle time spent at the airport, allowing travelers to spend this time productively, by relaxing and focusing on personal care and wellness. We believe that XpresSpa is well positioned to benefit from consumers’ growing interest in health and wellness and increasing demand for spa services and related wellness products.
 
In addition, a confluence of microeconomic events has created favorable conditions for the expansion of retail concepts at airports, in particular, retail concepts that attract higher spending from air travelers. The competition for airplane landings has forced airports to lower landing fees, which in turn has necessitated augmenting their retail offerings to offset budget shortfalls. Infrastructure projects at airports across the country, again intended to make an airport more desirable to airlines, require funding from bond issuances that in turn rely upon, in part, the expected minimum rent guarantees and expected income from concessionaires.
 
Equally as important to the industry growth is XpresSpa’s flexible retail format. XpresSpa opens multiple locations annually, which have ranged in size from 300 square feet to 3,000 square feet, with a typical size of 1,000 to 1,200 square feet. XpresSpa is able to adapt its operating model to almost any size location available in space constrained airports. This increased flexibility compared to other retail concepts allows XpresSpa to operate multiple stores within an airport, from which it enjoys synergies due to shared labor between stores.
 
XpresSpa’s total revenues have increased 49% from approximately $29,353,000 in 2012 to $43,820,000 in 2016, largely as a result of the growth in the number of spas, from 28 in January 2012 to 53 in December 2016.

XpresSpa regularly measures comparable store sales, which it defines as current period sales from stores opened more than 12 months compared to those same stores’ sales in the prior year period (“Comp Store Sales”). The measurement of Comp Store Sales on a daily, weekly, monthly and year-to-date basis provides an additional perspective on XpresSpa’s total sales growth when considering the influence of new unit contribution. A reconciliation between Comp Store Sales, which is a non-GAAP measure commonly used in the retail industry, and total revenue as reported on the financial statements is presented below:
 

(In Thousands) | 2012 | | 2013 | | | 2014 | | 2015 | 2016 | 
---------------------+------+--------+------+---+--------+------+---+--------+------+-------
Comp Store Sales | $ | 21,461 | | $ | 26,569 | | $ | 31,441 | $ | 34,060 | $ | 38,943
Non-Comp Store Sales | | 7,892 | | | 7,326 | | | 5,906 | | 4,783 | | 4,877 
Total Revenue | $ | 29,353 | | $ | 33,895 | | $ | 37,347 | $ | 38,843 | $ | 43,820

 
XpresSpa believes that its operating metrics represent an attractive return on invested capital and, as a result, is pursuing new locations at airports and terminals around the country. Historically, XpresSpa has won approximately four out of every five requests for proposal (“RFP”) in which it has participated.
 
Group Mobile
 
We acquired Group Mobile on October 15, 2015. Group Mobile provides total hardware solutions, including rugged laptops, tablets, and handheld computers. Group Mobile also markets rugged mobile printers, vehicle computer docking and mounting gear, power accessories, wireless communication products, antennas, carrying cases and other peripherals, accessories and add-ons needed to maximize productivity in a mobile- or field-computing environment. Group Mobile’s professional service offerings are evolving into project lifecycle services including technology consultations, development and deployment, project and asset management, equipment installation, break-fix, hardware service technical support, 24-7 helpdesk and more.
 
Group Mobile is aggressively pursuing sales of Law Enforcement In-Vehicle “Video and Body-Worn” camera solutions to meet the complex mobile technology demands of thousands of law enforcement agencies and officers in the United States market. Key to the Group Mobile long-term strategy is the complete professional services, post deployment services and lifecycle management of Group Mobile offerings to bring stability to the customer mobile technology platforms.
 
Group Mobile purchases rugged mobile computing equipment and complementary products from its primary distribution and manufacturing partners and sells them to enterprises, resellers, and retail customers. Our primary customers range from corporations to local governments, emergency first responders and healthcare organizations. We believe that the market for rugged mobile computing products is trending towards an increase in the volume of unit sales combined with declining unit prices as the business transitions from primarily being comprised of laptops to one primarily comprised of rugged tablets. As this transition has occurred, Group Mobile is seeing shortened product life cycles and industry specific devices for segments such as healthcare. Group Mobile sets sale prices based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product. Group Mobile is highly dependent on the end-market demand for rugged mobile computing products, which is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new IT products by Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”), replacement cycles for existing rugged mobile computing products, overall economic growth, local and state budgets, and general business activity.


Product costs represent the single largest expense and product inventory is one of the largest working capital investments for Group Mobile. Group Mobile’s primary suppliers include Synnex Corporation, Ingram Micro Inc., Xplore Technologies Corporation, and Motion Computing, which, combined, represent approximately 81% of Group Mobile’s inventory purchases. We have reseller agreements with most of our OEM and distribution partners. These agreements usually provide for nonexclusive resale and distribution rights. The agreements are generally short-term, subject to periodic renewal, and often contain provisions permitting termination by either our supplier or us without cause upon relatively short notice. Furthermore, product procurement from the OEM suppliers is a highly complex process and, as such, efficient and effective purchasing operations are critical to Group Mobile’s success.

FLI Charge
 
FLI Charge is an early stage company that designs, develops, licenses, manufactures and markets power transfer and charging solutions. FLI Charge is currently working with partners in several verticals to bring products to market. These verticals include education, office, hospitality, power tools, automotive and consumer electronics, among others.


The FLI Charge ecosystem consists of powered surfaces and enablement chips that seamlessly transfer power to electronic devices. FLI Charge surfaces are connected to a power source or battery. The surfaces have conductive contact strips that provide power and are constantly monitored by control circuitry that immediately halts power transfer if an unapproved load or short-circuit condition is detected. FLI Charge-enabled devices are embedded with the FLI Charge contact enablement that consists of four contact points, known as the FLI Charge “constellation.” The constellation is designed to make an immediate and continuous electrical connection with the contact strips regardless of the device’s position or orientation on the surface. The enablement monitors the power coming from the surface and ensures that the correct amount of power goes to the device. Once an approved FLI Charge device is placed on a surface, power is transferred immediately to charge or power the device.
 
There are several competing charging technologies on the market or under development today. The most popular competing technology is inductive wireless charging, in which magnetic induction uses a magnetic coil to create resonance, which can transmit energy over a relatively short distance. The amount of power delivered is a function of the size of the coils, and the coils must be aligned and paired within a typical distance of less than one inch. Products utilizing magnetic induction have been available for 10+ years in products such as rechargeable electronic toothbrushes and pace makers. The leading inductive technologies deliver a maximum of 20 watts. Other competing technologies include magnetic resonance, RF harvesting, laser and ultrasound.
 
FLI Charge launched its consumer product line on Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform, on June 15, 2016; the campaign was completed on August 15, 2016. FLI Charge delivered products to the participants in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property operating segment is engaged in the innovation, development and monetization of intellectual property. Our portfolio consists of patents and patent applications covering ad-insertion, wireless power, and mobile technologies.
 
We are currently focused on monetizing our technology portfolio through a variety of value enhancing initiatives including, but not limited to, licensing, litigation and strategic partnerships. We are currently asserting patents in litigation related to ad-insertion and remote monitoring.
 
Recent Developments
 
XpresSpa Acquisition


On August 8, 2016, we signed an agreement to acquire XpresSpa. On December 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of XpresSpa for a total purchase consideration of $37,400,000, which includes:
 

(a) | $1,734,000 in cash which was invested on August 8, 2016.
----+---------------------------------------------------------


(b) | 2,500,000 shares of FORM common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“FORM Common Stock”).
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | 494,792 shares of our newly designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, (“FORM Preferred Stock”) with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $23,750,000.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement governing the XpresSpa acquisition, in February 2017, in view of unexpected expenses, the parties mutually agreed to reduce the purchase price consideration and, as a result, the total number of shares of FORM Preferred Stock was decreased from 494,792 shares to 491,427 shares with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $23,588,000, which are initially convertible into 3,931,416 shares of FORM Common Stock, at a conversion price of $6.00 per share. Each holder of FORM Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on an as converted basis.



(d) | Five-year warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of FORM Common Stock, at an exercise price of $3.00 per share, each subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, dividend or similar events.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
230,208 shares of FORM Preferred Stock, with an estimated fair value of $11,050,000, were placed into an escrow that will be subject to release over an 18 month period once certain conditions are satisfied. The escrow will be used to obtain necessary lease consents from the airports and to cover potential liabilities that may arise after the acquisition, but pertain to the activities before the acquisition.
 
The FORM Preferred Stock is senior to the FORM Common Stock and the terms of the FORM Preferred Stock contain no restrictions on our ability to issue additional senior preferred securities or our ability to issue additional preferred securities in the future. We have the right, but not the obligation, upon ten trading days’ notice to convert the outstanding shares of FORM Preferred Stock into FORM Common Stock at the then applicable conversion ratio, at any time or from time to time, if the volume weighted average price per share of the FORM Common Stock exceeds $9.00 for over any 20 days in a 30 consecutive trading day period. The term of the FORM Preferred Stock is seven years, after which time we can repay the holders in shares of FORM Common Stock or cash at our election. If we elect to make a payment, or any portion thereof, in shares of FORM Common Stock, the number of shares deliverable (the “Base Shares”) will be based on the volume weighted average price per share of the FORM Common Stock for the 30 trading days prior to the date of calculation (the “Base Price”) plus an additional number of shares of FORM Common Stock (the “Premium Shares”), calculated as follows: (i) if the Base Price is greater than $9.00, no Premium Shares shall be issued, (ii) if the Base Price is greater than $7.00 and equal to or less than $9.00, an additional number of shares equal to 5% of the Base Shares shall be issued, (iii) if the Base Price is greater than $6.00 and equal to or less than $7.00, an additional number of shares equal to 10% of the Base Shares shall be issued, (iv) if the Base Price is greater than $5.00 and equal to or less than $6.00, an additional number of shares equal to 20% of the Base Shares shall be issued and (v) if the Base Price is less than or equal to $5.00, an additional number of shares equal to 25% of the Base Shares shall be issued. The FORM Preferred Stock will accrue interest at 9% per annum.
 
Assignment of Infrastructure Patent Portfolio
 
On December 5, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Nokia Corporation (“Nokia”) to assign Nokia rights related to certain patents previously purchased from Nokia. The carrying value of the patents assigned to Nokia prior to the agreement was $1,186,000, which offset the $1,750,000 of royalty payable and resulted in a gain of $564,000 on the disposal of assets, which is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We retained selected patents previously purchased from Nokia with a carrying value of $50,000 as of December 31, 2016 that are no longer subject to any royalty payments to Nokia.
Senior Secured Notes
 
As of December 31, 2016, we no longer had an outstanding balance for our Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the “Notes”), as the Notes were repaid in full during the year. The details of our significant transactions during 2016 pertaining to the Notes are described below.
 
On March 9, 2016, we and the holders (the “Investors”) of our $12,500,000 Notes, which we originally issued in a registered direct offering on May 4, 2015, entered into an exchange note agreement (the “Exchange Note Agreement”). Pursuant to the Exchange Note Agreement, we issued to the Investors an aggregate of 703,644 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in exchange for the reduction of $1,267,000 of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes and $49,000 of accrued interest. As a result, the outstanding aggregate principal amount under the Notes was reduced from $3,016,000 to $1,749,000 as of March 9, 2016.

In addition, on March 9, 2016, with the consent of each of the Investors, we agreed to amend the Notes. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Notes (the “Amended Notes”) and the Indenture dated May 4, 2015, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated May 4, 2015 and further supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture (the “Second Supplemental Indenture”) dated March 9, 2016: (i) the Amended Notes are no longer convertible into shares of our common stock and are payable by us on the Maturity Date (as defined below) in cash only, (ii) the Maturity Date of the Amended Notes was extended to June 30, 2017 (the “Maturity Date”), (iii) we discontinued the payment of principal prior to the Maturity Date (subject to certain exceptions), (iv) the interest rate increased from 8% to 10% per annum and accrues on the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Amended Notes, payable monthly, and (v) we will pay to the Investors on the Maturity Date 102% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Amended Notes. We also agreed to maintain a cash balance (including cash equivalents) of not less than $2,900,000.
 
We also agreed to reduce the exercise price of the warrants to purchase an aggregate of 537,500 shares of our common stock pursuant to the initial agreement (the “May 2015 Warrants”) from $10.00 to $3.00 per share and we agreed to remove from the May 2015 Warrants certain anti-dilution features. Other terms of the May 2015 Warrants remained the same. Furthermore, in connection with the Amended Notes, we paid a restructuring fee of $50,000 to the Investors.
 
On July 1, 2016, we repaid in full the Amended Notes that were due on June 30, 2017, including a 15% fee for early repayment. We used an aggregate of $2,011,000 of cash on hand for repayment of the Amended Notes. As a result of the repayment in full of the Amended Notes, all liens on our assets, including intellectual property, were released by the Investors.
 
Impairment of Patents
 
Our name change and repositioning as a holding company was deemed a triggering event, which required our patent assets to be tested for impairment. In performing this impairment test, we determined that the patent portfolios, which together represent an asset group, were subject to impairment testing. In the first step of the impairment test, we utilized our projections of future undiscounted cash flows based on our existing plans for the patents. As a result, it was determined that our projections of future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the asset group. Accordingly, we performed the second step of the impairment test to measure the potential impairment by calculating the asset group’s fair value as of May 6, 2016. As a result, following amortization for the month of April, we recorded an impairment charge of $11,937,000, which resulted in a new carrying value of $1,526,000 on May 6, 2016. Following the impairment, we reevaluated the remaining useful life of the patent assets and concluded that there were no changes.
Stockholder Rights Plan
 
On March 18, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan in the form of a Section 382 Rights Agreement designed to preserve our tax assets. As a part of the plan, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred-share-purchase right for each share of our common stock outstanding as of March 29, 2016. Effective on March 18, 2016, if any group or person acquires 4.99% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, or if a group or person that already owns 4.99% or more of our common stock acquires additional shares representing 0.5% or more of our common stock, then, subject to certain exceptions, there would be a triggering event under the plan. The rights would then separate from our common stock and would be adjusted to become exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock having a market value equal to twice the purchase price of $9.50, resulting in significant dilution in the ownership interest of the acquiring person or group. Our Board of Directors has the discretion to exempt any acquisition of our common stock from the provisions of the plan and has the ability to terminate the plan prior to a triggering event. In connection with this plan, we filed a Certificate of Designation of Series C Junior Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Delaware on March 18, 2016.

Reverse Stock Split
 
Unless otherwise noted, the information contained in these consolidated financial statements gives effect to a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our common stock effected on November 27, 2015 (the “Reverse Stock Split”) on a retroactive basis for all periods presented.
 
Competition
 
Each of our four reporting segments operates in different competitive environments.
 
XpresSpa
 
XpresSpa operates 53 locations, which includes 49 domestic locations and four international locations. Our domestic units operate within many of the largest and most heavily trafficked airports in the United States. The competitive landscape for wellness service providers in airports consists of approximately 110 spas across North America. XpresSpa’s 49 domestic units represent approximately 45% of the total North American market. The balance of the North American market is highly fragmented and is represented largely by small, privately-owned entities that operate one or two locations in a single airport. Only three other market participants operate 10 or more airport locations in the United States. The largest domestic competitor operates 18 locations in eight airports. Outside of North America, this same competitor operates 18 locations in seven international airports.
Group Mobile
 
Our rugged devices reselling business is regionally focused with the majority of our customers having direct relationships with local sales staff. Most competitors are private companies that have limited infrastructure. We believe that our key competitive advantages are knowledge, service and breadth of products relative to these competitors. As we grow the business, we also believe that we will be able to further improve our service and overall shopping experience.
 
FLI Charge
 
There are several competing wire-free power and charging technologies on the market or under development today. The most popular competing technology is inductive wireless charging, in which magnetic induction uses a magnetic coil to create resonance, which can transmit energy over very short distances. Power is delivered as a function of coil size, and coils must be directly paired within a typical distance of less than one inch. Products utilizing magnetic induction have been available for 10+ years and include rechargeable electronic toothbrushes and pace makers. Other competing technologies include magnetic resonance, RF harvesting, laser and ultrasound. Most competitors utilize these competing technologies and not our technology.
 
As compared to each of the competing wireless technologies above, we believe that our conductive technology exhibits many competitive advantages including:
 

• | charge rates/efficiency – FLI Charge pads charge devices nearly as fast as plugging them into a wall outlet;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | multiple devices – FLI Charge pads can charge or power multiple devices at the same time without reducing the charging speed;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | safety – FLI Charge’s technology is as safe as plugging devices into a wall outlet;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maximum power – FLI Charge pads can supply as much as 150 watts of power, which is enough to charge or power devices with relatively high power requirements such as power tool batteries and flat screen monitors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11

 


• | positioning freedom – FLI Charge’s technology allows for devices to be placed in any orientation, anywhere on the pad, without sacrificing any charging speed; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compatibility – all FLI Charge enabled electronic devices are compatible with all FLI Charge pads.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 
After a period of intense competition from public and private companies for the acquisition of intellectual property assets, prices have dropped substantially. Due to the many patent sales and divestments over the past few years, many companies continue to seek to monetize intellectual property by licensing their patents to companies in a number of technology sectors. This has occurred in an increasingly challenging and changing legal environment for monetizing patents. Relatively new procedures at the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as the anticipation of the Unified European Patent Court have created uncertainty as to the value of patent assets.
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2017, we and our subsidiaries had 673 full-time and 90 part-time employees. XpresSpa had 58 full-time employees in San Francisco International Airport, who are represented by a labor union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. XpresSpa had 25 full-time employees in Los Angeles International Airport, who are represented by a labor union and, starting in March 2017, will be covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Our Company
 
We were incorporated in Delaware as a corporation on January 9, 2006 and completed an initial public offering in June 2010. On May 6, 2016, we changed our name to FORM Holdings Corp. from Vringo Inc. and concurrently announced our repositioning as a holding company of small and middle market growth companies.
