Overview
We are a pioneer and leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their IT infrastructures, help protect their IT systems and applications from ever-evolving cyber-attacks and achieve compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Our cloud solutions address the growing security and compliance complexities and risks that are amplified by the dissolving boundaries between internal and external IT infrastructures and web environments, the rapid adoption of cloud computing and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. Our integrated suite of security and compliance solutions delivered on our Qualys Cloud Platform enables our customers to identify their IT assets, collect and analyze large amounts of IT security data, discover and prioritize vulnerabilities, recommend remediation actions and verify the implementation of such actions. Organizations use our integrated suite of solutions delivered on our Qualys Cloud Platform to cost-effectively obtain a unified view of their security and compliance posture across globally-distributed IT infrastructures.
IT infrastructures are more complex and globally-distributed today than ever before, as organizations of all sizes increasingly rely upon a myriad of interconnected information systems and related IT assets, such as servers, databases, web applications, routers, switches, desktops, laptops, other physical and virtual infrastructure, and numerous external networks and cloud services. In this environment, new and evolving technologies intended to improve organizations’ operations can also increase vulnerability to cyber attacks, which can expose sensitive data, damage IT and physical infrastructures, and result in serious financial or reputational consequences. In addition, the rapidly increasing amount of data and devices in IT environments makes it more difficult to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner. The predominant approach to IT security has been to implement multiple disparate security products that can be costly and difficult to deploy, integrate and manage and may not adequately protect organizations. As a result, we believe there is a large and growing opportunity for comprehensive cloud-based security and compliance solutions.
We designed our Qualys Cloud Platform to transform the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructures and applications. Our cloud platform offers an integrated suite of solutions that automates the lifecycle of asset discovery, security assessments, and compliance management for an organization’s IT infrastructure and assets, whether they reside inside the organization, on their network perimeter, on endpoints or in the cloud. Since inception, our solutions have been designed to be delivered through the cloud and to be easily and rapidly deployed on a global scale across a broad range of industries, enabling faster implementation and lower total cost of ownership than traditional on-premise enterprise software products. Our customers, ranging from some of the largest global organizations to small businesses, are served from our globally-distributed cloud platform, enabling us to rapidly deliver new solutions, enhancements and security updates. 
We were founded and incorporated in December 1999 with a vision of transforming the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructure and applications and initially launched our first cloud solution, Qualys Vulnerability Management (VM), in 2000. Our VM Solutions have provided a substantial majority of our revenues to date, representing 76%, 77% and 80% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, our VM Solutions included revenues from VM, Private Cloud Platform, Continuous Monitoring, Cloud Agent for VM, AssetView, and ThreatPROTECT. In 2015, our VM Solutions included revenues from VM, Private Cloud Platform, Continuous Monitoring and Cloud Agent for VM. In 2014, our VM Solutions included revenues from VM, Private Cloud Platform and Continuous Monitoring. In prior 10-Q and 10-K filings, we had included all revenues from scanners and credits for prepaid services in our VM Solutions revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we changed the methodology to allocate revenues from scanners and credits across our products. Based on the prior methodology, our VM Solutions would have made up 78% of total revenues in 2016, down 1% from 79% in 2015. 
As VM gained acceptance, we introduced new solutions to help customers manage increasing IT security and compliance requirements. In 2006, we added our PCI Compliance solution, and in 2008, we added our Policy Compliance (PC) solution. In 2009, we broadened the scope of our cloud services by adding Web Application Scanning. In 2012, we introduced our virtualized private cloud platform as an additional deployment option of our solutions for customers and partners. In 2014, we released Continuous Monitoring for internet-facing systems, which allows customers to continuously monitor their mission-critical assets and to be alerted to security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may make them more susceptible to a cyber-attack. In 2014, we also launched Web Application Firewall (WAF). Qualys WAF, currently is in limited release, it delivers enterprise-grade

web application security without the costs, footprint, and complexity associated with appliance-based web application firewall solutions. In 2015, we introduced our Cloud Agent Platform (CAP), which provides customers with the ability to secure IT assets on a continuous basis regardless of where they reside, inside the enterprise, in the cloud or mobile endpoints. CAP allows organizations to perform vulnerability and compliance management on a continuous basis. It is a natural extension to our cloud platform and allows us to expand our footprint in the enterprise and provide VM and PC solutions to mobile endpoints and elastic cloud environments. In 2015, we also launched AssetView and Security Assessment Questionnaire. AssetView is a free, cloud-based asset inventory service that provides visibility and actionable data on global IT assets within an organization. We don’t charge for AssetView but do charge for AssetView synchronization with ServiceNow CMDB (Configuration Management Database). This integrates our robust asset discovery and classification capabilities with ServiceNow’s platform. Security Assessment Questionnaire enables organizations to better orchestrate security assessments or compliance audits with automated validation. In 2016, we introduced ThreatPROTECT, which prioritizes identified vulnerabilities for customers using our VM solution.
We provide our solutions through a software-as-a-service model, primarily with renewable annual subscriptions. These subscriptions require customers to pay a fee in order to access our cloud solutions. We invoice our customers for the entire subscription amount at the start of the subscription term, and the invoiced amounts are treated as deferred revenues and are recognized ratably over the term of each subscription. We continue to experience significant revenue growth from existing customers as they renew and purchase additional subscriptions. Revenues from customers existing at or prior to December 31, 2015 grew by $20.4 million to $184.7 million during 2016, representing 112% of total revenues in 2015. We expect revenue growth from existing customers to continue. Subscriptions from new customers added in 2016 contributed $13.2 million to the increase in revenues.
Our Qualys Cloud Platform is currently used by over 9,300 customers, excluding security consulting firms, in more than 100 countries, including a majority of each of the Forbes Global 100 and Fortune 100. Our revenues increased from $133.6 million in 2014 to $164.3 million in 2015, and reached $197.9 million in 2016. We generated net income of $30.2 million in 2014, $15.9 million in 2015, and $19.2 million in 2016. Net income in 2014 includes a tax benefit of $23.7 million due to reversal of deferred tax valuation allowance. Total assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $407.0 million and $323.5 million, respectively.
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to leverage our innovation and extensive expertise to strengthen our leadership position as a trusted provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions. The key elements of our growth strategy are:

• | Continue to innovate and enhance our cloud platform and suite of solutions. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to extend our cloud platform’s functionality by developing new security solutions and capabilities and further enhancing our existing suite of solutions. In 2015, we introduced our Cloud Agent Platform, which provides customers with the ability to secure IT assets on a continuous basis regardless of where they reside, inside the enterprise, in the cloud or mobile endpoints. Our CAP also enables us to deliver additional new solutions as we develop them. In 2015, we also launched AssetView and Security Assessment Questionnaire. AssetView is a free, cloud-based asset inventory service that provides visibility and actionable data on global IT assets within an organization. We don’t charge for AssetView but do charge for AssetView synchronization with ServiceNow CMDB (Configuration Management Database). This integrates our robust asset discovery and classification capabilities with ServiceNow’s platform. Security Assessment Questionnaire enables organizations to better orchestrate security assessments or compliance audits with automated validation. In 2016, we introduced ThreatPROTECT, which prioritizes identified vulnerabilities for customers using our VM solution. 


• | Expand the use of our suite of solutions by our large and diverse customer base. With more than 9,300 customers across many industries and geographies, we believe we have a significant opportunity to sell additional solutions to our customers and expand their use of our suite of solutions. Since typically our customers initially deploy one or two of our solutions and in select parts of their IT infrastructures, our existing customers serve as a strong source of new sales as they expand their scope and increase their subscriptions, or choose to adopt other solutions from our integrated suite of IT security and compliance offerings. In this regard, we continue to expand our sales execution and marketing functions to increase adoption of our newly developed solutions among our existing customers.

• | Drive new customer growth. We are pursuing new customers by targeting key accounts and expanding our sales and marketing organization and network of channel partners. We will continue to seek to make significant investments to encourage organizations to replace their existing security products with our cloud solutions. 


• | Broaden our global reach. We intend to expand our relationships with key security consulting organizations, managed security service providers and value added resellers to accelerate the adoption of our cloud platform. We seek to strengthen existing relationships as well as establish new relationships to increase the distribution and market awareness of our cloud platform and target new geographic regions. We also plan to partner with such security providers that can host our Private Cloud offering within their data centers, helping us expand our reach in new markets and new geographies. 


• | Selectively pursue technology acquisitions to bolster our capabilities and leadership position. We may explore acquisitions that are complementary to and can expand the functionality of our cloud platform. We may also seek to acquire technology teams to supplement our own team and increase the breadth of our cloud-based security and compliance solutions. 

Our Platform
Our Qualys Cloud Platform consists of a suite of IT security and compliance solutions that leverage our shared and extensible core services and our highly scalable multi-tenant cloud infrastructure.
Our suite of solutions provides security intelligence by automating the life cycle of IT asset discovery, security assessment and compliance management. Our core services layer provides a set of advanced shared technologies that are leveraged by our suite of security and compliance solutions, which we refer to as our Core Services.
Built on our cloud platform infrastructure, our Core Services provide an integrated framework with proprietary functionalities that act as building blocks to enable efficient and scalable delivery of our customer-facing cloud solutions. Our cloud platform’s infrastructure includes integrated services that deliver a highly automated and scalable scanning infrastructure capable of scanning IT systems and web applications, inside and outside corporate firewalls.
The Core Services and infrastructure layers of our cloud platform deliver benefits to our entire suite of security and compliance solutions, including:

• | Dynamic and interactive user interfaces with configurable report templates to present scan data with a wide range of presentation options to match a customer’s needs;


• | Fast searching of several extensive Qualys data sets, including scan results, asset data, scan profiles, users and vulnerabilities;


• | Asset management technology for hierarchical asset categorization via dynamic tagging and role-based customer access management; and


• | Distributed scanning platform for global cloud-based environments.

We also provide open application program interfaces, or APIs, and other developer tools that allow third parties to embed our technology into their solutions and build applications on our cloud platform.
Our cloud platform is delivered to customers via our shared platform offering from our global data centers or via our private platform offering (Qualys Private Cloud Platform, or PCP), for customers or partners that want the platform to reside within the customer's on-premise data center. The PCP is a standalone version of our multi-layer, multi-tenant services architecture and is a fully integrated turnkey solution, making it more scalable, cost effective and faster to deploy within a customer's on-premise data center. Solutions delivered through our PCP are typically on the same subscription basis as solutions delivered through our shared platform. Our PCP utilizes hardware and software owned by us and physically located on the customer's premises. The customer is not permitted to take possession of the software or access the software code. Our PCP provides our subscription-based platform services to the customer using a virtual version of our software. This virtualized PCP allows us to extend our security and compliance solutions without the complexity and cost associated with deploying traditional enterprise software. Additionally, we introduced in 2016, the Private Cloud Platform Appliance (PCPA), an on-premise security and compliance solution packaged in a form-factor for medium-sized companies.

Our Customers
We market and sell our solutions to enterprises, government entities and to small and medium-sized businesses across a broad range of industries, including education, financial services, government, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, media, retail, technology and utilities. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 9,300 customers, excluding security consulting firms, in more than 100 countries, including a majority of each of the Forbes Global 100 and Fortune 100. In each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, 71%, 70% and 70% respectively, of our revenues were derived from customers in the United States. We sell our solutions to enterprises and government entities primarily through our field sales force and to small and medium-sized businesses through our inside sales force. We generate a significant portion of sales through our channel partners, including managed service providers, value-added resellers and consulting firms in the United States and internationally.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We market and sell our IT security and compliance solutions to customers directly through our sales teams as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners.
Our global sales force is organized into a field sales team, which focuses on enterprises, generally including organizations with more than 5,000 employees, and an inside sales team, which focuses on small to medium businesses, which generally include organizations with less than 5,000 employees. Both our field and inside sales 
9

teams are divided into three geographic regions, including the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia-Pacific. We also further segment each of our sales teams into groups that focus on adding new customers or managing relationships with existing customers.
Our channel partners maintain relationships with their customers throughout the territories in which they operate and provide their customers with services and third-party solutions to help meet those customers’ evolving security and compliance requirements. As such, these partners offer our IT security and compliance solutions in conjunction with one or more of their own products or services and act as a conduit through which we can connect with these prospective customers to offer our solutions. Our channel partners include security consulting organizations, managed service providers and resellers, such as Deutsche Telekom AG, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Insight Technologies, Inc., Optiv Security, Inc., SecureWorks Corp, and Verizon Communications Inc.
For sales involving a channel partner, the channel partner engages with the prospective customer directly and involves our sales team as needed to assist in developing and closing an order. When a channel partner secures a sale, we sell the associated subscription to the channel partner who in turn resells the subscription to the customer, with the channel partner earning a fee based on the total value of the order. Once the order is completed, we provide these customers with direct access to our solutions and other associated back-office applications, enabling us to establish a direct relationship as part of ensuring customer satisfaction with our solutions. At the end of the subscription term, the channel partner engages with the customer to execute a renewal order, with our sales team providing assistance as required. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, 42%, 39% and 39% respectively, of our revenues were generated by channel partners.
Marketing
Our marketing programs include a variety of online marketing, advertising, conferences, events, public relations activities and web-based seminar campaigns targeted at key decision makers within our prospective customers.
We have a number of marketing initiatives to build awareness and encourage customer adoption of our solutions.

Research and development expenses were $35.3 million, $29.5 million and $26.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Manufacturing Agreement
Our physical appliances are provided by SYNNEX Corporation, or SYNNEX, pursuant to a manufacturing services agreement dated March 1, 2011. Under this agreement, SYNNEX manufactures, assembles and tests our physical scanner appliances. This agreement has an initial term of one year, which is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated (i) at anytime upon the mutual written agreement of us and SYNNEX, (ii) by either party upon 90 days or more written notice, (iii) upon written notice, subject to applicable cure periods, if the other party has materially breached its obligations under the agreement or (iv) by either party upon the other party seeking an order for relief under the bankruptcy laws of the United States or similar laws of any other jurisdiction, a composition with or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or dissolution or liquidation.
Data Center Agreements 
Our data center operations are provided by large third-party data center vendors and are located in the United States, Switzerland, the Netherlands and India. Our data center agreements have varying terms through 2018.
Competition
The expanding capabilities of our security and compliance solutions have enabled us to address a growing array of opportunities in the cloud IT security and compliance market. We compete with a large and broad array of established and emerging vulnerability management vendors, compliance vendors and data security vendors in a highly fragmented and competitive environment.
We compete with large public companies, such as Barracuda Networks, Hewlett-Packard Company, Imperva, Inc., International Business Machines Corporation, Rapid7, Inc. and Symantec Corporation, as well as privately held security providers including BeyondTrust Software, Inc., McAfee, NetIQ Corporation, Tenable Network Security, Inc., Tripwire, Inc. and Trustwave Holdings, Inc. We also seek to replace IT security and compliance solutions that organizations have developed internally. As we continue to extend our cloud platform’s functionality by further developing security and compliance solutions, such as web application scanning and firewalls, we expect to face additional competition in these new markets.
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for cloud-based security and compliance solutions include product functionality, breadth of offerings, flexibility of delivery models, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership, scalability and performance, customer support and extensibility of platform. We believe that our suite of solutions generally competes favorably with respect to these factors. However, many of our primary competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology. We have six issued patents, several pending U.S. patent applications and an exclusive license to four U.S. patents, which was obtained in connection with our acquisition of Nemean. The inbound license remains in effect until the licensed patents are no longer enforceable, unless the applicable license agreement is first terminated by us or terminated by the licensor for a breach of the agreement or if we undergo certain bankruptcy events. The licenses are currently exclusive and will remain exclusive so long as we make an appropriately-timed written election and pay an annual fixed royalty for ten years thereafter. These exclusive licenses are subject to the licensor’s reservation of certain rights in the patents and subject to the U.S. government’s reserved rights in the technology. We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other 
11

proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, as we have spent years designing and developing our Qualys Cloud Platform, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors.
We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 684 full-time employees, including 285 in research and development, 179 in sales and marketing, 136 in operations and customer support and 84 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2016, we had 344 employees in the United States and 340 employees internationally. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees in certain European countries have collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
