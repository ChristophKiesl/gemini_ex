COMPANY OVERVIEW
Over 100 years ago, Deluxe Corporation began providing payment solutions. Our longevity is a testament to our innovation and our ability to evolve with our customers. We now provide an increasingly diversified suite of products and services and we have become a trusted partner to small businesses and an integral part of the financial services industry. Our vision is to be the best at helping small businesses and financial institutions grow. We provide a suite of customer life cycle management solutions that help our customers acquire and engage their customers across multiple channels. To promote and sell a wide range of products and services, we use printed and electronic marketing; a direct sales force; referrals from financial institutions, telecommunication clients and other partners; purchased search results from online search engines; and networks of distributors and independent dealers.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Our business segments are generally organized by type of customer served and reflect the way we manage the company. Additional information concerning our segments appears under the caption “Note 16: Business segment information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report.
Small Business Services
Small Business Services operates under various brands, including Deluxe®, NEBS®, Safeguard®, PsPrint®, Hostopia®, Aplus.net®, Inkhead®, Payce®, PAYweb®, Logo Mojo® and VerticalResponse®, among others. This is our largest segment in terms of revenue and operating income and we are concentrating on profitably growing this segment. Small Business Services strives to be a leading supplier to small businesses, as well as partners and channels that support small businesses, by providing personalized products and services that help them operate and market their businesses. This segment sells products and services to small businesses in North America and portions of South America and Europe.
Small Business Services' products are distributed through multiple channels. Our primary customer acquisition methods are direct response mail and internet advertising; referrals from financial institutions, telecommunications clients and other partners; networks of distributors and independent dealers; a direct sales force that focuses on selling to and through major accounts; and an outbound telemarketing group. Customer service for initial order support, product reorders and routine service is provided by a network of call center representatives located throughout the United States and Canada.
Our Small Business Services strategies are as follows:

• | Effectively acquire and retain customers by optimizing each of our sales channels;


• | Expand sales of higher growth and recurring marketing solutions and other service offerings;


• | Increase our share of the amount small businesses spend on the types of products and services in our portfolio through increased brand awareness, channel coverage, and improved customer acquisition; and


• | Continue to optimize our cost and expense structure.

To support our strategies and to reposition Small Business Services as not just a provider of business checks and printed forms, but also as a provider of higher growth marketing solutions and other services, we have two strategic focus areas:

1. | Payments and marketing solutions:


* | Focus on core check retention and acquisition and on developing incremental retail customer acquisition channels.


* | Profitably scale integrated marketing-on-demand solutions, with the largest opportunity in major accounts.


* | Optimize electronic payment solutions with a focus on building opportunities with financial institutions, medical and insurance payments processors, accounting services and software providers, and other document management and payment solution companies.


2. | Web services:


* | Improve the digital marketing customer experience and cross-sell across all customers and channels, including through our integrated Deluxe Marketing Suite, while continuing to build partnerships and explore acquisition opportunities.


* | Focus on scaling payroll services and continue to evaluate early stage businesses and other operational annuity growth solutions.


* | Accelerate our brand awareness transformation, showing a clear linkage between marketing and revenue-generating capabilities.

In support of our strategies, we expect to continue identifying opportunities to expand sales to our existing customers and to acquire new customers, including the small business customer referrals we receive through our Deluxe Business Advantage® program. This program provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses. Our relationships with financial institutions are important in helping us more deeply serve unique customer segments such as contractors, retailers and professional services firms. In addition, we expect to continue to acquire customers through our telecommunications clients, media partners and major account clients. We invest in our e-commerce and technology platforms to increase opportunities to market and sell on-line, and we utilize various marketing channels, including internet, direct mail solicitations and television. Our distributor and dealer networks and our major accounts channel increase our distribution reach through dedicated “feet on the street,” resellers and partner operations, and allow us to increase sales to existing customers and acquire new customers in multiple ways. 
We continuously evaluate ways to strengthen our portfolio of products and services through acquisitions, partnerships and internal development. In recent years, we have acquired a number of new businesses that have expanded our marketing solutions and other services offerings, including technology-based solutions such as web services, payroll services, web-to-print capabilities, internet marketing services and eChecks. Sales of these higher growth products and services are expected to 
represent an increasing portion of our revenue. Additional information concerning our acquisitions appears under the caption “Note 5: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. In addition, we continually track innovations within the marketplace coming from competitors, best-of-breed companies and open source technology products and communities. When making decisions regarding the technologies and methodologies to employ within our product and service areas, we incorporate leading new techniques when they meet our fundamental needs for scale, flexibility and security. We also monitor feedback from all of our customer communications channels to ensure we are offering the products and features our customers want.
We continue our efforts within Small Business Services to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. Small Business Services outsources the production of some of its products, including certain business forms, promotional products and apparel. In conjunction with our cost reduction initiatives, we continually seek to further enhance our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements. In addition, the expertise we have developed in logistics, productivity and inventory management has allowed us to reduce the number of facilities we operate, while still meeting client requirements. During 2016, we closed a call center located in Los Angeles, California, a warehouse located in Houston, Texas and a facility housing general office space in Burnsville, Minnesota. During 2015, we closed a facility located in American Fork, Utah that housed a call center and administrative functions, as well as a call center located in Charlotte, North Carolina and a sales facility located in Venice, California. The operations of these facilities were integrated into existing Small Business Services operations.
Financial Services
Financial Services' products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force, which executes product and service supply contracts with our financial institution clients nationwide, including banks, credit unions and financial services companies. Building on our long-standing reputation in the financial services market as a leading check provider, we have expanded our offerings to include a growing suite of software and cloud-based products and services designed to help financial institutions better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle. Our sales force is selling these life cycle management solutions through our existing financial institution customer channel to existing clients and to new clients.
Our Financial Services strategies are as follows:

• | Optimize core check revenue streams and acquire new clients;


• | Expand sales of higher growth marketing solutions and other services that differentiate us from the competition; and


• | Continue to optimize our cost and expense structure.

We have two focus areas that support our Financial Services strategies:

1. | Retail banking, which includes checks and data-driven marketing solutions:


* | Focus on retaining clients and gain market share in our check programs.


* | Leverage First Manhattan Consulting Group, LLC (FMCG Direct) and Datamyx data-driven analytics and marketing capabilities across financial institution depository and lending products.


2. | Commercial banking:


* | Profitably scale our treasury management solutions.


* | Integrate acquisitions we have already completed and execute tuck-in acquisitions.

Despite the decline in check usage, checks continue to be an important source of revenue. Our check supply contracts usually range in duration from three to six years. As part of our check programs, we provide enhanced services such as customized reporting, file management, expedited account conversion support, fraud protection services, new account support, trackable delivery and billing services. Consumers typically submit their check order to their financial institution, which then forwards the order to us. However, consumers may also submit their check orders over the phone or internet. We process the order and ship it directly to the consumer. Financial Services produces a wide range of check designs, with many consumers preferring one of the dozens of licensed or cause-related designs we offer. We also continue to leverage our Deluxe Business Advantage program, which is designed to maximize financial institution business check programs. It offers many of the products and services of our Small Business Services segment to the small business customers of financial institutions through a number of service level options. The revenue from the products and services sold through this program is reflected in our Small Business Services segment.
In our ongoing efforts to expand well beyond our legacy check-related products, we offer several solutions designed to help financial institutions operate more effectively and better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle. All of these offerings build on our reputation as a longstanding and trusted partner of financial institutions, especially when it comes to outsourced solutions and securely managing sensitive customer data. Our service offerings include the following:

• | Wausau Financial Systems – a comprehensive suite of treasury management solutions available at the customer site, as well as via software-as-a-service and business process outsourced deployment models, including the offerings of FISC Solutions, which was acquired in December 2015, and Data Support Systems, which was acquired in October 2016.


• | Deluxe Rewards – a loyalty and rewards platform that offers multiple touch points that enable our clients to have ongoing engagement with their customers.


• | Deluxe Marketing Services – a variety of direct marketing solutions that help financial institutions acquire new customers, deepen existing customer relationships and retain customers. These offerings leverage data and analytics to help our clients execute marketing campaigns for depository and lending products across multiple contact channels, including direct mail, email, online and digital. This suite of offerings was augmented with our October 2015 acquisition of Datamyx®, a software-as-a-service data and analytics platform focused on marketing programs for lending products, and our December 2016 acquisition of FMCG Direct, a provider of data-driven marketing solutions for financial institutions.


• | Banker's Dashboard – online financial management tools that provide financial institutions with comprehensive daily insights into their financial picture.


• | Deluxe Strategic Sourcing – a comprehensive, outsourced service that enables financial institutions to improve efficiency, financial controls and pricing compared to self-managing multiple supplier relationships.


• | Deluxe Detect® – a new account online screening tool.


• | Provent® – a comprehensive suite of identity protection services largely complimentary to our check offerings.


• | SwitchAgent® – a digital channel onboarding solution enabling consumers to easily set up the online banking aspects of a new account, making it easier for financial institutions to attract and anchor new customers.

We continue to advance our marketing solutions and other services offerings both via acquisitions and internal development. In recent years, we have acquired a number of new businesses that have expanded our marketing solutions and other services offerings, including data and analytics-driven marketing solutions and treasury management solutions. Sales of these higher growth services are expected to represent an increasing portion of our revenue. Additional information concerning our acquisitions appears under the caption “Note 5: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. We expect that providing a growing suite of products and services will offset the impacts of the decline in check usage and the continued pricing pressure we are experiencing in our check programs. As such, we continue to focus on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services, utilizing client feedback and market research to identify client needs and gaps. During the past year, we have also invested in extending the Deluxe brand to increase brand awareness and loyalty in the financial services market beyond check-related solutions.
Financial Services continues to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. During 2016, we closed a warehouse located in Nashville, Tennessee and during 2015, we closed a call center located in Plymouth, Michigan, as well as a warehouse located in Livonia, Michigan. The operations of these facilities were integrated into existing Financial Services operations.
Direct Checks
Direct Checks is the nation's leading direct-to-consumer check supplier, selling under various brand names, including Checks Unlimited®, Designer Checks®, Checks.com®, Check Gallery®, The Styles Check Company®, and Artistic Checks®, among others.
We use a variety of direct marketing techniques to acquire new customers, including newspaper inserts, in-package advertising, statement stuffers and co-op advertising. We also use search engine marketing and search engine optimization strategies to direct traffic to our websites, which include: checksunlimited.com, designerchecks.com, checks.com, 4checks.com, checkgallery.com, styleschecks.com, and artisticchecks.com, among others.
Direct Checks competes primarily on price and design. We believe that pricing in the direct-to-consumer channel is generally lower than retail prices charged to consumers in the financial institution channel. We compete on design by seeking to offer the most attractive selection of images with high consumer appeal, many of which are licensed from well-known artists and organizations.
Our Direct Checks strategies are as follows:

• | Maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features, accessories and products;


• | Continue to optimize our cost and expense structure; and


• | Optimize cash flow.

We continue to actively market our products and services through targeted advertising, including a continued focus on the internet channel. We continue to explore avenues to increase sales to existing customers as we investigate opportunities to provide accessories and other check-related products and services to customers. One such example is the check protection service we offer in partnership with EZShield, Inc., which provides reimbursement to consumers for losses resulting from forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks. We also continue to work on a number of initiatives to create an integrated best-in-class direct-to-consumer check experience. As in our other two business segments, Direct Checks continues to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. We continue to identify additional opportunities to lower our cost and expense structure in all functional areas, particularly in the areas of marketing and fulfillment.
MANUFACTURING AND FULFILLMENT/SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES
We continue to focus on improving the customer experience by providing excellent service and quality, reducing costs and increasing productivity. We accomplish this by embedding lean operating principles in all processes, while emphasizing a culture of continuous improvement. Under this approach, employees work together to produce products, rather than working on individual tasks in a linear fashion. Because employees assume more ownership of the end product, we experience improved quality and productivity, as well as lower costs.
We continue to sponsor “sustainability” initiatives that encompass environmentally-friendly practices. We have aligned with suppliers that promote sustainable business practices and we continually seek opportunities to eliminate wasted material, reduce cycle times and use more environmentally-friendly materials. More than 90% of our check and form paper is purchased from Forest Stewardship Council certified supplier mills, most of our vinyl checkbook covers are produced utilizing a minimum of 40% post-industrial recycled material and we use environmentally-friendly janitorial supplies. Our sustainability initiatives have also benefited our results of operations over the past several years as we focus on reducing our consumption of water, electricity and natural gas, and improving our transportation efficiency. We continue efforts to reduce solid waste sent to landfills, and we have been a member of the Environmental Protection Agency's Green Power Leadership Club since 2010. The renewable energy that we purchased during 2016 amounted to approximately 77% of our annual U.S. electricity needs.
The expertise we have developed in logistics, productivity and inventory management has allowed us to reduce the number of production facilities we operate, while still meeting client requirements. During 2016, we moved production out of our Lancaster, California manufacturing facility, during 2015, we closed our Plymouth, Michigan and Burnsville, Minnesota fulfillment operations and during 2014, we closed our Bethlehem, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. These operations were moved to other existing locations.
We have a shared services approach, which allows our three business segments to leverage shared manufacturing facilities to optimize capacity utilization, enhance operational excellence and foster a culture of continuous improvement. We continue to reduce costs by utilizing our assets and printing technologies more efficiently and by enabling employees to better leverage their capabilities and talents.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Checks
According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2016, debit card, credit card and ACH payments all exceeded the number of checks written in 2015. Approximately 19.4 billion checks were written in 2015, accounting for approximately 13% of all non-cash payment transactions. This is a reduction from the Federal Reserve Study released in December 2013 when checks accounted for approximately 17% of all non-cash payment transactions. The Federal Reserve estimates that checks written declined approximately 4.8% per year between 2012 and 2015, a slower decline than the 8.8% per year decline documented between 2009 and 2012. In 2017, we anticipate check order declines to range from between 5% and 6%, slightly higher than our 2016 decline rate. We expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire and ACH transfers, and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative. 
In addition, steps have been taken in the development of a real-time payments system in the United States. The Federal Reserve established the Faster Payments Task Force with the objective of identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a faster payments system and is encouraging the private sector to create real-time payment solutions. In April 2016, FIS, a FinTech company, and The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC announced plans to run a nation-wide real-time payments system pilot during the first quarter of 2017. Also, a number of financial institutions are members of Early Warning's clearXchange® network and/or ZelleSM, which enable their customers to send or receive real-time person-to-person payments to or from customers of participating network banks, and person-to-person digital wallet services such as Venmo® allow individuals to transfer funds to other users. While we cannot predict the impact real-time payment systems will have on check usage, nor the speed at which such systems will become prevalent in the United States, a related study commissioned by the Federal Reserve from McKinsey & Company concluded that check usage could be reduced by one-third if a real-time payments system were to become widely available in the United States. However, the rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty.
In addition to the shift to electronic payment methods, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts also impact the number of checks consumers use. We estimate that the 2016 growth rates for consumer spending and private sector employment most likely had a slightly negative impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau in January 2017, housing units completed during 2016 
increased almost 10% as compared to 2015. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.
Small Business Customers
According to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, there were approximately 31.4 million small businesses in the United States in 2014, defined as independent businesses having fewer than 500 employees. According to the most recent data published by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada and Statistics Canada, as of December 2015, there were approximately 4.0 million small businesses in Canada, defined as employer businesses with fewer than 100 employees.
In recent years, we believe the economy negatively impacted our operating results and/or our growth opportunities in our Small Business Services segment. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic conditions than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) publishes the results of quarterly surveys which provide an indication of small business owners' view of economic conditions. The index of small business optimism published by the NFIB in December 2016 was 105.8, the highest level since 2004, compared to 95.2 in December 2015. The net percent of small business owners expecting general conditions to be better 6 months from now also showed significant improvement in the fourth quarter of 2016, going from 0% in September 2016 to 50% in December 2016. If this more optimistic trend translates to sustainable economic growth, we should realize positive impacts on our business. However, we cannot predict whether economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.
Sales of business checks and forms have been declining, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition to the decrease in the use of checks due to the availability of alternative payment methods, continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will achieve widespread acceptance.
Financial Institution Clients
Checks are most commonly ordered through financial institutions, including banks, credit unions and other financial services companies. As such, several developments related to financial institutions have affected the check printing portion of the payments industry.
Financial institutions seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated from their check programs, despite the decline in check usage. This continues to put significant pricing pressure on check printers. In addition, the number of potential financial institution clients in the United States is declining. According to statistics published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Credit Union National Association, the number of financial institutions has been declining for many years. When financial institutions consolidate through mergers and acquisitions, often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other financial institution in the merger/acquisition. Financial institution mergers and acquisitions can also impact the duration of our contracts. Normally, the length of our supply contracts with financial institutions ranges from three to six years. However, contracts may be renegotiated or bought out mid-term due to a consolidation of financial institutions. Banks, especially larger ones, may request prepaid product discounts in the form of cash incentives payable at the beginning of a contract. These contract acquisition payments negatively impact check producers' cash flows at the beginning of these contracts. To the extent financial institution failures and consolidations impact large portions of our customer base, this could have a significant impact on our financial institution check programs.
Direct Mail Response Rates
Direct Checks and portions of Small Business Services have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms and the increasing use of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. We continually evaluate our marketing techniques in order to utilize the most effective and affordable advertising media.
Competition
The markets for small business services and supplies are highly fragmented and geographically dispersed, with many small local suppliers, large national retailers and internet-based providers. In these markets, the competitive factors influencing a customer's purchase decision are breadth and quality of product and service offerings, ease of use of web and other services, price, speed of delivery, convenience, the responsiveness and quality of customer support, and past experience with the supplier. Our primary competitors include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting and domain name registration; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email and social media marketing services companies; small business products and services resellers; media directory providers; and on-line and off-line suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Additionally, the competitive landscape for e-commerce continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence. We believe we are well-positioned in this competitive landscape through our broad customer base, the breadth of our small business product and service offerings, multiple distribution channels, established relationships with our financial institution and telecommunications clients and other partners, competitive prices, ease of use of our web and other services, high quality and dependable service.
In the check printing portion of the payments industry, we face considerable competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some retailers. We expect competition to remain intense as check usage continues to decline. Moreover, the check product must compete with alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative. The principal factors on which we compete are product and service breadth, price, quality and check merchandising program management. We believe the key items which differentiate us from our competition include our fully automated flat check delivery package, our online performance dashboard and portal analytics tools for financial institution branches, our personalized customer call center experience, and our Deluxe Business Advantage program, which provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses. In addition, Small Business Services offers an electronically-delivered check solution, Deluxe eChecks, to provide our small business customers with an online payment solution.
At times, check suppliers have reduced the prices of their products during the supplier selection process in an attempt to gain greater volume. The corresponding pricing pressure has negatively impacted our profit margins. Pricing pressure will continue to impact our results of operations through lower pricing levels or client losses. Additionally, product discounts in the form of cash incentives payable to financial institutions upon contract execution are a common practice within the industry. Both the number of financial institution clients requesting these payments and the size of the payments has fluctuated in recent years. These up-front payments negatively impact check printers' cash flows at the beginning of the contracts, so we do attempt to minimize the use of up-front product discounts by structuring new contracts with alternative incentives throughout the duration of the contract.
Our Financial Services marketing solutions and other services offerings also face intense competition, including competition from financial institution core banking software providers, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous financial technology services providers offering services such as customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, receivable management and treasury support services, and rewards and loyalty solutions. We expect the intensity of competition to increase from established and emerging financial technology companies. The competitive factors affecting Financial Services marketing solutions and other services offerings include breadth and quality of services, ease of use, price, solution completeness, responsiveness and quality of customer support, as well as the ability to manage end-to-end financial institution processes.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal trends in sales of some of our products. For example, holiday card, retail packaging sales, and rewards and loyalty solutions are typically stronger in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season and FMCG Direct data-driven marketing solutions are usually higher in the fourth quarter of the year due to peak financial institution demand. Sales of tax forms are stronger in the first and fourth quarters of the year, and check sales for our Direct Checks segment have historically been stronger in the first quarter of the year. In addition, as revenue from our marketing solutions offerings continues to increase, we may experience some fluctuations in revenue driven by our clients' marketing campaign cycles. 
Materials, Supplies and Service Providers
The principal materials used in producing our main products are paper, plastics, ink, cartons and printing plate material, which we purchase from various sources. We also purchase stock business forms and promotional apparel produced by third parties. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of materials from current or alternative suppliers.
We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications and network server and transaction processing services. We also rely upon third parties to provide a portion of the data used to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including credit and non-credit data from the national 
credit bureaus and other data brokers. We believe we would be able to obtain an alternative source of supply if one or more of our service providers failed to perform.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations is significant and regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time. We believe that our business is operated in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Further information regarding the impact of specific laws and regulations can be found in Item 1A of this report. At this time, we are not aware of any changes in laws or regulations that will have a significant impact on our business during 2017.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights, either of which may adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Check designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average two to three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably. If we were to lose the rights to a significant portion of our licensed check designs, it may adversely impact our results of operations.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 5,433 employees in the United States, 574 employees in Canada and 19 employees in Europe. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
AVAILABILITY OF COMMISSION FILINGS
We make available through our investor relations website, Deluxe.com/investor, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after these items are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

CODE OF ETHICS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES
We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to all of our employees and our board of directors. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our investor relations website, Deluxe.com/investor, and also can be obtained free of charge upon written request to the attention of Investor Relations, Deluxe Corporation, P.O. Box 64235, St. Paul, Minnesota 55164-0235. Any changes or waivers of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct will be disclosed on our website. In addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of the Audit, Compensation, Corporate Governance and Finance Committees of our board of directors are available on our website or upon written request.
One of the policies supporting our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct addresses political contributions. It is not our practice to make political contributions. We permit political contributions only upon written approval by our most senior management in their capacity as the corporate Compliance Committee under our ethics and compliance program. The Compliance Committee has not approved any such contributions. We are a member of various trade groups that represent the 
interests of specified industries. However, as a part of those memberships, we have not provided funds designated for political contributions.
