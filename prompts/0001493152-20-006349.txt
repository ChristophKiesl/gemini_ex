ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Formation and Background
 
The Company was incorporated in 1999 in the state of Utah under the name Datigen.com, Inc. On August 25, 2005, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Utah to Nevada by merger and changed its name to Smart Energy Solutions, Inc.
 
Until November 24, 2004, the Company had been involved in various activities, including development and marketing of various internet and internet related products and services, investment in trust deed notes secured by real property, and providing certain construction services relating to compliance with certain provisions of the American Disability Act of 1991. On November 24, 2004, a majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock was purchased by Amir Uziel and six unaffiliated individuals from certain of the Company’s shareholders, including its then Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Ollivier.
 
On March 23, 2005, the Company acquired from Purisys, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (“Purisys”), the intellectual property rights and certain other assets relating to a product known as the Battery Brain. The Battery Brain is a device that is attached to a motor vehicle battery for the purpose of protecting the vehicle from battery failure and theft. On such date, the Company.
 
As part of this acquisition, we acquired certain liabilities of Purisys, namely (i) the warranties and service of any Battery Brain products sold prior to the execution and delivery of the Agreement, (ii) any potential claims made by a person who alleges that he assisted in developing the Battery Brain product and (iii) any taxes incurred as a result of the Agreement.

The company thereafter had little business activity.
 
In connection with the order of the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey dated June 7, 2013 (the “Consent Order Approving Settlement”) the Court authorized and approved the sale, transfer and assignment of all of the Company’s assets to Aharon Levinas personally, free and clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances and granting Mr. Levinas effective control of the Company.
 
During November 2014 and March 2015, L.I.A. Pure Capital Ltd., Amir Uziel, Lavi Krasney and Attribute Ltd., acquired control of the Company by purchasing a control block of shares each holding 137,500 shares representing 88% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
Our Canna Powder Business
 
On August 30, 2017, the Company formed Canna Powder Ltd. (the “Subsidiary”) which is 90% owned by the Company and 10% owned by Rafi Ezra, co-founder and chief technology officer of the Subsidiary. This business segment is our primary asset and business at this time.
 
On September 14, 2017, the Subsidiary entered into a Feasibility Study and Option Agreement (the “Feasibility Study”) with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (“Yissum”), under the supervision of the inventor of the technology, Professor Shlomo Magdassi. The Subsidiary commenced efforts to develop the formulation and process to produce medical products using new technology involving nano-powder derived from cannabis oil.
 
On May 2, 2018, the Subsidiary entered into a Research Agreement with Yissum to develop nano-cannabis powder, standardized from cannabis oil in a known cannabinoid composition, with the view to applying it to enable the commercial production of cannabis powder to treat a myriad of medical conditions (the “Cannabis Powder Products”).
 
The Company currently expects that the research and development program under the Research Agreement will be completed within three years, with commercial sales of Cannabis Powder Products expected to commence in 2021. However, there can be no assurance that the development of the technology will be successful, that research will be completed by 2021 or that commercially viable Cannabis Powder Products will be developed and be accepted by the market in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to acquire the additional capital to fully implement its business plan and complete production of commercially viable products based on the technology being developed.
 
On May 2, 2018, the Company entered into a separate License Agreement with Yissum under which the Subsidiary was granted the exclusive license to commercially exploit any technology related to the Cannabis Powder Products resulting from the efforts under the Research Agreement (the “License”). The License expires on the latter of: (i) the date of expiration in such country of the last to expire Licensed Patent included in the Licensed Technology; (ii) the date of expiration of any exclusivity on the Product granted by a regulatory or government body in such country; or (iii) twenty years from the date of the first commercial sale in such country. Should the periods referred to in Subsections (i) or (ii) expire in a particular country prior to the period referred to in Subsection (iii), above, the license in that country or those countries shall be deemed a license to the Know-How during such post-expiration period. The License Agreement also provides that the Subsidiary pay Yissum (i) a royalty equal to 4% of net sales of the Cannabis Powder Products; and (ii) a sublicense fee equal to 20% of any sublicense consideration received by the Subsidiary.
 

On October 8, 2018, the Company signed a binding memorandum of understating with UNV Medicine Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Israel (“UNV”), under which the Subsidiary paid $274,531 to UNV and in return UNV will finance and purchase a line of production equipment to be used for the production of the Canna Products, based on the Subsidiary’s specifications. In addition, Canna Ltd received 200,000 UNV shares. This agreement was terminated during the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
As a result of the new business activity, on December 11, 2017 the Company’s name was changed to CannaPowder, Inc. in order to better reflect the Company’s business operations.
 
Competition
 
The Company’s CannaPowder business is in a growing and competitive market. We compete with many companies that provide different Cannabis oil related products or by products.
 
The advantages of cannabis powder are widely accepted and there is reason to believe that other companies and institutions are developing and testing methods to produce powders in commercial quantities.
 
Existing Approaches for Cannabis Powder
 
Existing approaches to producing cannabis powders are based on old technologies which absorb oil into existing solid particles.
 
There is no established market leader and no evidence that any individual company has so far achieved any real market penetration.
 
The other methods that are currently used to produce cannabis powders include the following:
 
● Microencapsulation - oil droplets are adsorbed onto solid particles. The solids act as carriers which in one hand contain the oily droplets and on the other hand are water miscible themselves. This technique allows some delivery improvements with relation to oil-only preparations but still suffers from important limitations which include: low oil/solid ratio, typically 15%; low partitioning of the oil from the solid particles and relatively large particle size (10-20 micron) which limits the absorption rate into the target tissues.
 
● Fine grating of the whole flowers - probably the oldest method, easy to obtain with no need for sophisticated equipment. However, fundamental limitations apply including: unknown cannabinoids ingredients, inactivated cannabinoids and inconsistency between batches.
 
● Refined butters from cannabis oil - using a series of processes distills and separates certain cannabinoids (usually CBD) resulting in solid oils. Although promising by high purity, Cannabis butters have their limitations. The refining process yields very small amounts and accordingly is not suitable for industrial mass production processes. Cannabis butters are less efficient, clinically, compared to cannabis oil. This is mainly because the process exiles all the other cannabinoids and terpenes which are known to work together producing the desired effects. Finally, partitioning of the cannabinoids out of the butter is very low.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
CannaPowder will compete with companies using old technologies based on several factors including:
 

a) | Ability to supply a consistent product 
---+----------------------------------------------------------
b) | Ability to provide more effective products 
c) | Generally, meet demand for high quality. 
d) | Ability to be used in a wide variety of dosage forms. 

 
CannaPowder is confident that its licensed technology will provide a strong edge compared to other companies with new technologies. Its access to research facilities in Israel which have a long experience in the cannabis field can also be decisive.
 
In addition, first mover advantage will be exploited to build relationships with medical cannabis producers and distributors in the leading territories.
 
The in-house knowledge in CannaPowder creates the opportunity to design and produce its own pharmaceutical products. In such a model, CannaPowder would supply API's enabling it to initiate new fields of innovative treatments in the medical cannabis world.
 
There will also be the opportunity for CannaPowder to design and produce its own products, such as inhalers being final products which comprise powders with units for administering the cannabis.
 
Government Regulation or Approvals
 
investment opportunity is based on several critical factors, including government Regulation and Approvals. In the world of medical cannabis, important trends are being developed by the regulator.
 
Israel is widely regarded as a world leader in cannabis research, and is where THC, the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, was first isolated and identified by Professor Raphael Mechoulam in 1964. As a result of its national regulatory structure, which permits medical testing of cannabis products in controlled scientific studies, Israel is a hotbed of advanced cannabis-related R&D.
 
There are now 40 companies in Israel that are authorized and licensed for cannabis. That number is expected to reach 200 in the coming years. CannaPowder believes that this will enrich the sector and work for its benefit as more companies emerge in the space. CannaPowder will provide a base product that these companies can use.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not have a seasonal business cycle.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our business currently does not implicate any environmental regulation.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not hold any patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property on products relating to our business other than as relates to our licenses.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we have no employees. Our two executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. We currently outsource all professional services to third parties in an effort to maintain lower operational costs.
Impact of Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company
 
As of March 29, 2020, we have not experienced any delays or adverse affects relating to Coronavirus Pandemic, except a slight slowdown in planning of the research and development facility in Israel. Nonetheless, as our license is through an Israeli entity which conducts research and operations in Israel, it is anticipated that the Coronavirus related social distancing and “stay at home” rules may slow development, manufacture or marketing of our products. This may have a material impact on our business.
