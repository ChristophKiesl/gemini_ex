Industry Overview
 
Communications solution providers are investing in their networks for growth in subscriber acquisition and retention, while streamlining their operations to reduce costs and complexity. Drivers for this network investment include the evolution of government funding programs, regulatory broadband policies, competition, increasing subscriber demand for broadband and merger obligations.
 Subscriber demand for higher bandwidth continues to increase due to increasing numbers of connected devices, shifting working arrangements, OTT video, the prevalence of IoT and cloud services and the increasing use of internet applications. Performance is directly related to bandwidth availability. As the demand for high-definition video streaming services, symmetric bandwidth for video conferencing and collaboration tools, low-latency cloud gaming services and smart home video surveillance applications continues to increase, so too does the need for higher bandwidth to the home and business. ADTRAN serves as a trusted partner to our customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we enable them to glean the maximum performance from their network, providing a flexible path for their networks to evolve cost effectively, and to further monetize their investments.

Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for SPs that enable them to address their increasing broadband demands. Our solutions focus on technology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home and business CPE and software platforms, and services needed to help our customers address increasing complexity while scaling to meet increasing consumer demands. We aspire to be one of the top communication technology players in the world and plan to achieve this goal through innovation in network, home and business technology paired with a customer-focused organizational structure that tailors solutions to meet the needs of our target customers. ADTRAN has a unique approach to our portfolio in which we are focused in specific markets where we can offer competitive differentiation and scale while also having enough diversity and breadth in the portfolio to provide end-to-end connectivity solutions that offer value to our customers.
Customers
 
We have a diverse global customer base that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Many network operators require product approval before the purchase or installation of a product. The nature of our business involves a dynamic process of submitting new and succeeding generations of products for approval prior to orders being placed.
 
Three customers, CenturyLink, Inc., Deutsche Telekom AG and KGP Logistics, individually comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2020. Additionally, our revenue in Germany comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2020. The revenue from these customers and country is reported in both our Network Solutions and Services & Support segments.
 For a discussion of risks associated with customers, service providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales and approval process required by major and other service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,” “Risk Factors – We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income,” and “Risk Factors – Consolidation and deterioration in the CLEC market could result in a significant decrease in our revenue,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 
Distribution, Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major accounts and has offices in domestic and international locations. Sales to most smaller and independent telephone companies are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us, or through one of our service providers, channel partners or distribution partners.
 
Before placing an order, service providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can extend for several months or even years. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply agreements that are generally not subject to minimum volume commitments. Service providers generally prefer having two or more suppliers for most products. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competition based on some combination of total value, service, price, delivery and other terms.
 
Orders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales organization for major accounts and a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be affiliated with the company as channel partners, or they may purchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate with us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other factors, to receive benefits such as product discounts, market development funds, technical support and training. 
 
Outside of the U.S., most service provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold direct or through distribution arrangements customized for each region. Some regions are supported from a field office that offers sales and support functions, and in some cases, warehousing and manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and service provider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and customer support groups. 
 
Our marketing organization promotes all brands associated with ADTRAN to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects throughout the world. Marketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our engineering teams to develop and promote new products and services as well as product enhancements.

Research and Development
 
Rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements and continuing developments in communications service offerings characterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these changes and to develop new and enhanced products that meet or anticipate market demand is a significant factor influencing our competitive position and our ability to grow.
 Our product development activities are an important part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and engineering functions are global. We maintain research and development functions at our Huntsville, Alabama headquarters and in Germany and other locations worldwide. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, research and development expenditures totaled $113.3 million, $126.2 million and $124.5 million, respectively.
 We develop our products either internally or by leveraging partners. Additionally, in some cases, we license intellectual property or acquire technologies. Internal development on advanced technology products gives us more control over design and manufacturing issues, while for traditional designs, ODM and/or licensed intellectual property provides us with the ability to leverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach ensures we provide best-in-class products for our customers.
 
As we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/NFV portfolio, our use of lean agile practices in research and development ensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster, at higher quality and more economically to our customers and the market on a continuous basis. 
 
Our ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business strategy. Our product development efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, allowing us to offer products at competitive prices. We then compete for market share. We continually re-engineer successive generations of existing products to improve our product performance, costs and value.
 
Development activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments that we consider viable revenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data, voice and video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet network architectures. This includes Ethernet aggregation, fiber-optic transport and access, DSL, access routing, Ethernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated access, converged services, VoIP, network management and professional services.
 
Our research function supports product development efforts throughout the Company. This function guides our various product design and engineering teams in digital signal processing technologies, computer simulation and modeling, CAD/CAM toolsets, custom semiconductor design, optical transceiver design, industry standards, technological forecasting, product development methods and emerging networks standards.
 
Many communication requirements, processes and technologies are governed by SDOs. These SDOs consist of representatives from various manufacturers, service providers and testing laboratories who work to establish specifications and compliance guidelines for emerging communications technologies. We are an active participant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.
 
Our SDO activities are primarily in the area of broadband access. This includes involvement with the ITU-T, ATIS, ETSI and the BBF. We are involved in the evolution of optical access technologies, participating in activities in the ITU-T, FSAN and BBF on next-generation PON. We are also involved in standards development efforts related to maximizing the bandwidth potential of the copper pair to enable new applications in the ITU-T. We continue to be involved with the industry-wide interoperability, performance-testing and system-level projects related to those standards in the BBF. We are also members of MEF, OCP, WFA, TIA, CableLabs and TIP.
 
For a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge development,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Manufacturing and Operations
 The principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final inspection, packing and shipping. We purchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of suppliers through a worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we manage a process that identifies the components that are best purchased directly by contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve manufacturing efficiency, quality and cost objectives. Certain key components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key components are available from only a limited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components, which has resulted in delays in related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and by maintaining close contact and building long-term relationships with our suppliers.
 We rely on subcontractors for assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and to purchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-volume, higher-mix products and build and test product prototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site in Huntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-mix assemblies to our subcontractors. Subcontract assembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to uncertainties in incoming order rates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors have proven to be flexible and able to meet our quality requirements. 
 We ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama, although we also fulfill customer orders from other locations near our customers' sites, when possible. The majority of our products shipped to EMEA customers come from locations in that region. We also ship directly from subcontractors to a number of customers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant to the most current releases of ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001. Our Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key suppliers are C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified to certain other customer, industry and privacy standards, including those relating to emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications. 
 For a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products may prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and operating results,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Competition
 
We compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for service providers, businesses, government agencies and other organizations worldwide. Our products and services provide solutions supporting voice, data and video communications across fiber-, copper-, coaxial- and wireless-based infrastructure, as well as across wide area networks, local area networks and the internet.
 
We compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. In our Access & Aggregation category, key competitors include Calix, Casa Systems, Ciena, CommScope, DZS, Huawei, Nokia, Vecima Networks and ZTE. In the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category, our primary competitors include Calix, Cisco, CommScope, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Juniper Networks, Ribbon Communications, Ubiquiti Networks and Zyxel. In addition to these OEM vendors, we face increasing competition from various ODM vendors who are being engaged directly by some of our service provider customers. Some of these companies compete in a single product segment, while others compete across multiple product lines. Competitors of our Services & Support business include Calix, Fujitsu Network Communications and Nokia.
 
For further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Seasonality
 
We have experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. These seasonal effects may continue to vary and do not always correlate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or operating results.
 

12



Foreign Currency
 
Transactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro, our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar, and our British subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Great British pound. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
Backlog and Inventory
 
A substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements containing nonbinding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. These factors normally result in very little order backlog or order flow visibility. Additionally, backlog levels may vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times. We believe that because we fill a substantial portion of customer orders within the fiscal quarter of receipt, backlog is not a meaningful indicator of actual revenue for any succeeding period. 
 
To meet this type of demand, we have implemented supply chain management systems to manage the production process. We maintain substantial inventories of raw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. We also maintain substantial finished goods inventories. Our practice of maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess and/or obsolete. This excess and obsolete inventory may require us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.
 
For further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Government Regulation
 
Our products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as well as those of certain international bodies. Environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing business as we amend our products to comply with these requirements. For example, the EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the REACH regulation. We continue to implement measures to comply with these directives and other similar directives and regulations from additional countries.
 
We strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of deploying services, increase the level of performance achievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital expenses for our customers, increase network bandwidth and functionality, and extend network reach. Our development process is conducted in accordance with ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international standards for quality and environmental management systems. Our corporate practices also conform to GDPR requirements, which protect digital data for all EU citizens, and to other applicable data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 For further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.”
 
13


Human Capital
 
We believe that our most valuable asset is our people. To ensure our Company continues to succeed, our objective is to be able to recruit, hire and retain top talent. Our ability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is dependent on our ability to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that provides opportunities for our employees to learn and grow in their careers. This is supported by strong compensation, benefits, community service and other programs that enable employees to build connections within the community.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,405 full-time employees, with 1,080 in the U.S. and 325 in our international subsidiaries located in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC regions. We also utilized 250 contractors and temporary employees domestically and internationally in various manufacturing, engineering, sales and general and administrative capacities, as needed. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. ADTRAN has a diverse employee base located in 17 countries. We pride ourselves on a highly educated workforce, and the majority of our employees serve in engineering, information technology and technical roles within the organization.
 
Until December 31, 2020, approximately 260 employees of ADTRAN GmbH were subject to collective bargaining agreements of either the Association of Metal and Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and Electrical Industry e.V. Although these collective bargaining agreements expired on December 31, 2020, negotiations with the employees of ADTRAN GmbH for a new collective bargaining agreement are ongoing and we have not experienced any work stoppage. None of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 
 
Additionally, we continually work to recruit technical talent in diverse communities through our cooperative education program. This program seeks to identify college students that major in relevant technology areas and expose them to the work environment at ADTRAN on an alternating semester basis. Our goal is to retain as many of these students as possible for full-time employment after graduation, as they are our Company's future.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We believe that maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to the success of our business. The Company encourages an environment where individuality is embraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity and perspective and where each employee is accepted and respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to work. To this end, we have established an employee-driven Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”) Task Force to spearhead our efforts. The DE&I Task Force is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer and employee volunteers who are passionate about DE&I and how it affects our workforce. 
 
In addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our Board of Directors with respect to skills, experience, gender, race and ethnicity. Our Board of Directors is comprised of six members, two of which are females and three of which are ethnically diverse. Additionally, the Board of Directors has a diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, crisis management, risk assessment, industry knowledge, corporate governance and global markets.
 
Health, Safety and Wellness
 
The well-being of our employees is paramount to the continued success of our business. To this end, we are committed to each of our employees' health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees with access to various health and wellness benefits designed to enable them and their family members to have affordable access to health, dental and vision insurance. Additionally, we offer access to many programs that provide additional monetary support in the event of a qualifying incident, including accident insurance, life insurance and hospital indemnity insurance, among others. We understand that mental health is an essential aspect of our employees’ wellbeing. As a result, we offer an employee assistance program at no charge to employees and their family members. This program provides access to qualified personnel to address various issues such as grief, financial stress, family and emotional issues.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We introduced enhanced health and safety standards that are in compliance with, or exceed, local, state and federal recommendations and regulations in the U.S. and at our international locations. This includes having the vast majority of our global employees work from home when possible. In areas where it is necessary to have critical, on-site personnel, such as at our manufacturing facilities, additional health and safety measures have been implemented to provide the safest environment possible for these workers. 
 

14



Compensation and Benefits
 
We continually work to provide a competitive compensation and benefits program as this plays a key role in our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, include long-term equity incentive awards with certain vesting requirements, deferred compensation plans, which are offered to certain of executive management, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid volunteer time off, employee assistance program and tuition assistance. Additionally, at our headquarters in Alabama, we offer our employees certain on-site services, including nurse practitioner care and a fitness center, among others.
Talent Development
 
We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a market-leading global supplier of broadband infrastructure. We offer numerous training opportunities on both technical and professional development topics. We recently enhanced tools and processes for providing performance feedback and developing high potential employees to become our future leaders.
 
The ADTRAN Career Development Program provides an opportunity for employees to shape their career journey. The program provides opportunities for employees to develop competencies in areas including technology, business acumen, emotional intelligence, design and systems thinking. As employees increase their competencies in these areas and master skills within their individual roles, this program offers a variety of career advancement paths. Employees also have access to the ADTRAN Learning Network. This platform houses all required training as well as optional training in a variety of areas.
 
Intellectual Property
 
ADTRAN develops and owns a significant amount of intellectual property. We hold over 600 patents worldwide related to our products and over 60 additional pending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2021 and 2038. We continue occasionally to seek additional patents related to our research and development activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the licensing of our patents.
 
The ADTRAN corporate logo is a registered trademark of ADTRAN, as is the name “ADTRAN”, “SmartRG” and a number of our product identifiers and names. We also claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.
 
We protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however, that our competitive success will not fully depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
 The communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing activities. We have received, and may continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. It is possible that such litigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement claims, or related litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
 
For a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
