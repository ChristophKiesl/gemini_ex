Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a global leader in the design, manufacturing and servicing of critical digital infrastructure technology that powers, cools, deploys, secures and maintains electronics that process, store and transmit data. We provide this technology to data centers, communication networks and commercial & industrial environments worldwide.
We believe there is a better way to meet the world's accelerating demand for data - one driven by passion and innovation.
Our Business
We have a suite of comprehensive offerings, innovative solutions and a leading service organization that supports a diversified group of customers, which we deliver from engineering, manufacturing, sales and service locations in more than 45 countries across the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”). We provide the hardware, software and services to facilitate an increasingly interconnected marketplace of digital systems where large amounts of indispensable data need to be transmitted, analyzed, processed and stored. Whether this growing quantity of data is managed centrally in hyperscale/cloud locations, distributed at the so-called “edge” of the network, processed in an enterprise location or managed via a hybrid platform, the underpinnings and operations of all those locations rely on our critical digital infrastructure and services.
We have a broad range of offerings, which include power management products, thermal management products, integrated rack systems, modular solutions, and management systems for monitoring and controlling digital infrastructure. These comprehensive offerings are integral to the technologies used for a number of services, including e-commerce, online banking, file sharing, video on-demand, energy storage, wireless communications, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and online gaming. In addition, through our global services network, we provide lifecycle management services, predictive analytics and professional services for deploying, maintaining and optimizing these products and their related systems.
Our primary customers are businesses across three main end markets: (1) data centers (including hyperscale/cloud, colocation, enterprise and edge), (2) communication networks and (3) commercial and industrial environments. Within these areas we serve a diverse array of industries, including social media, financial services, healthcare, transportation, retail, education and government. We approach these industries and end users through our global network of direct sales professionals, independent sales representatives, channel partners and original equipment manufacturers. Many of our installations are completed in collaboration with our customers and we work with them from the initial planning phase through delivery and servicing of the completed solution. This depth of interaction supports key customer relationships, sometimes spanning multiple decades. Our most prominent brands include Liebert, NetSure, Geist and Avocent.
Our business is organized into three segments according to our main geographic regions—the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA—and we manage and report our results of operations across these three business segments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Vertiv’s revenue was $4,370.6, of which 47% was transacted in the Americas; 31% was transacted in Asia Pacific; and 22% was transacted in EMEA as compared with our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $4,431.2, of which 50% was transacted in the Americas, 29% was transacted in Asia Pacific, and 21% in EMEA. 
Our Customers
Our primary customers are businesses across three main end markets: (1) data centers (including hyperscale/cloud, colocation, enterprise and edge), (2) communication networks and (3) commercial and industrial environments.
Data Centers: The primary purpose of a data center is to process, store and distribute data. There are a host of different sizes and types of data centers, but primarily they can be broken down into the following classifications:
•Cloud/Hyperscale: These facilities are massive in scale and are primarily used to support off-premise cloud applications. This portion of the industry is growing rapidly. Examples of companies in this space include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud.

•Colocation: These facilities range in size and offer users a location where they can place their information technology (“I.T.”) equipment, while the building and critical digital infrastructure is owned by the colocation 
company. This portion of the industry is growing rapidly. Examples of companies in this space include Digital Realty and Equinix.

•Enterprise: This classification refers to the “Fortune 1000” type businesses that have their own on-premises data centers. Examples of companies in this space include Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Walmart and Cleveland Clinic. We have found that the growth of the enterprise market, based on data centers and square footage, has generally been flat for the past three years.

•Edge: These types of data centers are at the infancy stage of their development and will be utilized by all of the aforementioned categories in the future. These locations are decentralized by nature and located closer to where the data is being demanded (i.e., towards the edge of the network). This market is small today, but the opportunities for growth in this space are expected to increase as the proliferation of connected devices and data storage needs continue to grow in the future.

Communication Networks: This space is comprised of wireline, wireless and broadband companies. These companies create content and are ultimately responsible for distributing voice, video and data to businesses and consumers. They deliver this data through an intricate network of wireline and wireless mediums. Additionally, some of these companies’ locations act as data centers where the data is delivered, processed and stored. This sector has a generally low single-digit growth profile.
Commercial/Industrial: This space is comprised of those applications that are tied to a company’s critical systems. Examples include transportation, manufacturing, oil and gas, etc. These applications are growing in their need for intelligent infrastructure and may be regulated or need to pass some level of compliance. The growth in this area generally tracks Gross Domestic Product.
Our Offerings
We design, manufacture and service critical digital infrastructure technology for data centers, communication networks and commercial/industrial environments. Our principal offerings include:
Critical infrastructure & solutions
We identify delivery of products as performance obligations within the critical infrastructure & solutions offering. Such products include AC and DC power management, thermal management, and integrated modular solutions.
Integrated Rack Solutions
Performance obligations within integrated rack solutions include the delivery of racks, rack power, rack power distribution, rack thermal systems, configurable integrated solutions, and hardware for managing I.T. equipment.
Services & spares
Services include preventative maintenance, acceptance testing, engineering and consulting, performance assessments, remote monitoring, training, spare parts, and critical digital infrastructure software.
Sales and Marketing
Due to the global nature of our customers, we go to market through multiple channels to ensure that we map our coverage to align with our customers’ buying organization. Our primary selling method is direct sales. To accomplish this, we have over 2,300 sales people located around the world. Additionally, we utilize a robust network of channel partners in the form of distributors, I.T. resellers, value-added retailers and original equipment manufacturers. This network helps extend our global reach to all corners of the world where we operate.
Backlog
Vertiv’s estimated combined order backlog was approximately $1,844.8 and $1,401.2 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The backlog consists of product and service orders for which a customer purchase order or purchase commitment has been received and which have not yet been delivered. Orders may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer. The following table shows estimated backlog by business segment at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

 | As of December 31,
(Dollars in millions) | 2020 | | 2019
Americas | 836.0 | | | $ | 701.8 | 
Asia Pacific | 445.9 | | | 297.3 | 
EMEA | 562.9 | | | 402.1 | 
Total Backlog | $ | 1,844.8 | | | $ | 1,401.2

The vast majority of the combined backlog as of December 31, 2020 is considered firm and is expected to be shipped within one year. We do not believe that Vertiv’s backlog estimates as of any date are necessarily indicative of our revenues for any future period. Backlog estimates are subject to a number of risks. See “Item 1A. Risk factors—Risks relating to our customers and our industry—We may not realize all of the sales expected from our backlog of orders and contracts.”
Research and Development
We are committed to outpacing our competitors and being first to market with new product developments and improvements. In 2020, Vertiv spent $228.6 on Research and Development (“R&D”). We use our R&D budget to focus on fostering new product innovation and engineering. We have global product leaders that manage global product lines and engineering organizations to ensure that we continue to be ahead of market trends by leveraging our regional input. These global groups are also supported by in-region product and engineering teams who are responsible for understanding and adapting our offerings to local market and customer requirements. These teams work closely with our sales and service network which allows us to receive and act upon customer feedback to continuously improve our offerings.
Competition
We encounter competition from a variety of areas; however the majority of our competitors are targeted within a specific offering or a specific geographic location. Competition in our markets is primarily on the basis of reliability, quality, price, service and customer relationships. Across our three markets, we encounter two principal types of competitors: niche players and global competitors. We believe we differentiate ourselves through our ability to service customers in each phase of the product lifecycle, our large customer network which allows us to address the local and regional needs of our customer base, our ability to apply our understanding of trends, technologies and the implementation of our offerings to our customers’ utilization of technology and our integration with third party software which allows us to customize solutions according to a particular customer’s needs.
Facilities, Operations and Supply Chain
Being able to serve our customers both on a global and regional level is important, thus that is how we have built our manufacturing footprint. We have significant manufacturing facilities in North and South America, Asia Pacific and EMEA. This well-diversified global network of facilities allows for cost, delivery and inventory optimization. Our manufacturing facilities are supported by regional engineering and configuration centers where, if our customers desire, we can tailor our products to the local market and to our customer’s requirements.
We have established a robust supply chain that is complementary to our manufacturing footprint. In addition to providing high quality service to our customers, this strategy avoids a significant dependence on a particular supplier or region.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 20,972 full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 8% of our employees are Manufacturing Operators and we use talent acquisition and retention practices, including but not limited to, college and university recruiting programs, job fairs, and compensation benchmarking, employee engagement and communication through email, social media and other communication platforms, and employee development and training programs including new product training for our sales and services organizations, “Managing@Vertiv” for our management level employees, and “MyFirst90Days” for newly hired employees as key human capital measures and objectives.
We are committed to attracting, hiring and developing the best and brightest talent and focus significant resources on supporting and managing our globally diverse employee population. We offer our employees competitive pay packages and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits and recognize that our success is based in large part on the talents and dedication of those we employ.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to create, obtain and protect intellectual property is important to the success of our business and our ability to compete. We create IP in our operations globally, and we work to protect and enforce our IP rights. We consider our trademarks valuable assets, including well-known marks such as Vertiv, Geist, Liebert, Energy Labs, NetSure, Avocent and Chloride.
In addition, we integrate licensed third party technology and IP into certain aspects of our products. Although certain third party proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular third party patent of license or group.
As of December 31, 2020 Vertiv had approximately 2,600 patents and approximately 480 pending, published or allowed patent applications, and approximately 1,780 registered trademarks and approximately 170 pending trademark applications.
Raw Materials
We obtain raw materials and supplies from a variety of sources and generally from more than one supplier. We believe our sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for our needs.
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to a broad range of foreign and domestic environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and requirements, including those relating to the discharge of regulated materials into the environment, the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes, human health and safety and the content, composition and takeback of our products. We maintain an environmental, health and safety compliance program, including policies and standards, dedicated staff, and periodic auditing and training. We also have a program for complying with the European Union Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, the European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals regulation, and similar requirements.
At sites which we own, lease or operate, or have previously owned, leased or operated, or where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous materials, we are currently liable for contamination, and could in the future be liable for additional contamination. We have projects under way at certain current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination. Compliance with laws regulating contamination and the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Business Combination
GSAH was incorporated on April 25, 2016 as a Delaware corporation under the name “GS Acquisition Holdings Corp” and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On June 12, 2018, GSAH closed its IPO of 69,000,000 units, including 9,000,000 units issued pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional units in full, at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating proceeds to GSAH of $690.0 before underwriting discounts and expenses. 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, GSAH closed the private placement of an aggregate of 10,533,333 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “Private Placement Warrants” and, together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”), initially issued to GS DC Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Sponsor”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating proceeds of $15.8. 
On the Closing Date, Vertiv Holdings Co (formerly known as GS Acquisition Holdings Corp), consummated the Business Combination pursuant to that certain Merger Agreement, by and among GSAH, Vertiv Holdings, the Vertiv Stockholder, the First Merger Sub and the Second Merger Sub. As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (1) First Merger Sub merged with and into Vertiv Holdings, with Vertiv Holdings continuing as the surviving entity and (2) immediately following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, Vertiv Holdings merged with and into Second Merger Sub, with Second Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity and renamed “Vertiv Holdings, LLC.” As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, (a) the Company directly owns all of the equity interests of Vertiv Holdings, LLC and indirectly owns the equity interests of its subsidiaries and (b) the Vertiv Stockholder, the sole equity owner of Vertiv Holdings prior to the Business Combination, holds 77,261,955 shares of our Class A common stock as of February 22, 2021. In connection with the Business Combination, the registrant changed its name from GS Acquisition Holdings Corp to “Vertiv Holdings Co”.
On February 6, 2020, GSAH’s stockholders, at a special meeting of GSAH, approved and adopted the Merger Agreement, and approved the Business Combination proposal and the other related proposals presented in the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on January 17, 2020.
The aggregate merger consideration paid by GSAH in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination was approximately $1,500 (the “Merger Consideration”). The Merger Consideration was paid in a combination of cash and stock. The amount of cash consideration paid to the Vertiv Stockholder upon the consummation of the Business Combination was $341.6. The remainder of the consideration paid to the Vertiv Stockholder upon the consummation of the Business Combination was stock consideration (“Stock Consideration”), consisting of 118,261,955 newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock (the “Stock Consideration Shares”), which shares were valued at $10.00 per share for purposes of determining the aggregate number of shares of our Class A common stock payable to the Vertiv Stockholder as part of the Merger Consideration. In addition, the Vertiv Stockholder is entitled to receive additional future cash consideration with respect to the Business Combination in the form of amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, by and between the Company and the Vertiv Stockholder (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”).
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, GSAH entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with Atlanta Sons LLC (the “Cote PIPE Investor”), a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of David M. Cote, GSAH Investors Emp LP (the “GS ESC PIPE Investor”), a Delaware limited partnership and an affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (NYSE: GS) and its affiliates (“Goldman Sachs”), and certain other “accredited investors” (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act), and their permitted transferees (collectively with the Cote PIPE Investor and the GS ESC PIPE Investor, the “PIPE Investors”), including certain executive officers of Vertiv (the “Subscribing Vertiv Executives”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors collectively subscribed for 123,900,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “PIPE Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $1,239.0. The private placement pursuant to which the PIPE Investors purchased the PIPE Shares (the “PIPE Investment”) was consummated in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. Each of GS Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs (the “GS Sponsor Member”), Cote SPAC 1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company managed by David M. Cote (the “Cote Sponsor Member” and, together with the GS Sponsor Member, the “Sponsor Members”), and Mr. James Albaugh, Mr. Roger Fradin and Mr. Steven S. Reinemund, GSAH’s independent directors prior to the Business Combination (such individuals collectively with the Sponsor Members, the “Initial Stockholders”) agreed to waive the anti-dilution adjustments provided for in GSAH’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, dated June 7, 2018 (“GSAH’s Certificate of Incorporation”), which were applicable to GSAH’s shares of Class B common stock prior to the Business Combination. As a result of such waiver, the 17,250,000 shares of GSAH’s Class B common stock automatically converted into shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis upon the consummation of the Business Combination (such shares prior to and after such conversion, the “founder shares”).
On the Closing Date, in connection with the Business Combination, we entered into certain related agreements including the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement (each of which is described below under “—Related Agreements.”
Related Agreements
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
On the Closing Date, we entered into the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement”), with the Initial Stockholders, the Vertiv Stockholder, the GS ESC PIPE Investor, the Cote PIPE Investor and certain other PIPE Investors (collectively, with each other person who has executed and delivered a joinder thereto, the “RRA Parties”), pursuant to which the RRA Parties are entitled to registration rights in respect of certain shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and certain other equity securities of the Company that are held by the RRA Parties from time to time.
The Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement provides that the Company will as soon as practicable but no later than the later of (i) 45 calendar days following the consummation of the Business Combination and (ii) 90 calendar days following the Company’s most recent fiscal year end, file with the SEC a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act registering the resale of certain shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and certain other equity securities of the Company held by the RRA Parties and will use its commercially reasonably efforts to have such shelf registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (x) the 90th calendar day following the filing date if the SEC notifies the Company that it will “review” such shelf registration statement and (y) the 10th business day after the date the Company is notified in writing by the SEC that such shelf registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review.
Each of the GS Sponsor Member, the Cote Sponsor Member and the Vertiv Stockholder is entitled to make up to two demand registrations in any 12 month period in connection with an underwritten shelf takedown offering, in each case subject to certain offering thresholds, applicable lock-up restrictions and certain other conditions. In addition, the RRA Parties have certain “piggy-back” registration rights. The Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement includes customary indemnification and confidentiality provisions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any registration statements filed pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement.
On February 7, 2020, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (the “Registration Statement on Form S-1”), to meet its obligations under the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement. In August 2020, the Vertiv Stockholder sold 26,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock in a secondary offering and in November 2020, the Vertiv Stockholder sold 18,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock in a secondary offering. The Company paid for certain fees and expenses equal to an aggregate of approximately $1.2 in connection with this registration statement and these offerings.
Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants Agreement
As part of GSAH IPO on June 12, 2018, GS Acquisition Holdings Corp issued to third party investors 69,000,000 units, consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant, at a price of $10.00 per unit. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “Public Warrants”).
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, GSAH closed the private placement of an aggregate of 10,533,333 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “Private Placement Warrants” and, together with the public warrants, the “warrants”), initially issued to GS DC Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Sponsor”), at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating proceeds of $15.8. Each Private Placement Warrant allows the sponsor to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share.
The Private Placement Warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable or salable until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrant.
Stockholders Agreement
On the Closing Date, the Company, the GS Sponsor Member, the Cote Sponsor Member and the Vertiv Stockholder entered into the Stockholders Agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”). The Stockholders Agreement provides that the Vertiv Stockholder may not transfer its Stock Consideration Shares until August 5, 2020, subject to exceptions allowing for certain transfers to related parties and transfers in connection with extraordinary transactions by the Company.
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Vertiv Stockholder has the right to nominate up to four directors to our Board of Directors, subject to its ownership percentage of the total outstanding shares of Class A common stock. If the Vertiv Stockholder holds: (i) 30% or greater of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will have the right to nominate four directors (two of which must be independent); (ii) less than 30% but greater than or equal to 20% of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will have the right to nominate three directors (one of which must be independent); (iii) less than 20% but greater than or equal to 10% of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will have the right to nominate two directors; (iv) less than 10% but greater than or equal to 5% of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will have the right to nominate one director; and (v) less than 5% of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will not have the right to nominate any directors. As long as the Vertiv Stockholder has the right to nominate at least one director, the Vertiv Stockholder shall have certain rights to appoint its nominees to committees of the Board of Directors and the Company shall take certain actions to ensure the number of directors serving on the Board of Directors does not exceed nine. In addition, the Stockholders Agreement provides that so long as the Company has any Executive Chairman or Chief Executive Officer as a named executive officer, the Company shall take certain actions to include such Executive Chairman or Chief Executive Officer on the slate of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors for election. The Stockholders Agreement also provides that, for so long as the Vertiv Stockholder holds at least 5% of our outstanding Class A common stock, the Vertiv Stockholder will have the right to designate an observer to attend meetings of the Board, subject to certain limitations.
Tax Receivable Agreement
On the Closing Date, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement, which generally provides for the payment by us to the Vertiv Stockholder of 65% of the cash tax savings in U.S. federal, state, local and certain foreign taxes, that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize) in periods after the closing of the Business Combination as a result of (i) increases in the tax basis of certain intangible assets of Vertiv resulting from certain pre-Business Combination acquisitions, (ii) certain U.S. federal income tax credits for increasing research activities (so-called “R&D credits”) and (iii) tax deductions in respect of certain Business Combination expenses. We expect to retain the benefit of the remaining 35% of these cash tax savings.
For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the applicable tax savings will generally be computed by comparing our actual tax liability for a given taxable year to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay in such taxable year without the tax basis in the certain intangible assets, the U.S. federal income tax R&D credits and the tax deductions for certain Business Combination expenses described above. Except as described below, the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue for twelve taxable years following the closing of the Business Combination. However, the payments described in (i) and (ii) above will generally be deferred until the close of our third taxable year following the closing of the Business Combination. The payments described in (iii) above will generally be deferred until the close of our fourth taxable year following the closing of the Business Combination and then payable ratably over the following three taxable year period regardless of whether we actually realize such tax benefits. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned on the Vertiv Stockholder’s continued ownership of our stock.
Under certain circumstances (including a material breach of our obligations, certain actions or transactions constituting a change of control, a divestiture of certain assets, upon the end of the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement or, after three years, at our option), payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be accelerated and become immediately due in a lump sum. In such case, the payments due upon acceleration would be based on the present value of our anticipated future tax savings using certain valuation assumptions, including that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the applicable tax assets and attributes covered under the Tax Receivable Agreement (or, in the case of a divestiture of certain assets, the applicable tax attributes relating to such assets). Consequently, it is possible in these circumstances that the actual cash tax savings realized by us may be significantly less than the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments we are required to make at the time of acceleration. Furthermore, the acceleration of our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. Additionally, the obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the acceleration of our obligation to make payments in the event of a change of control, could make us a less attractive target for a future acquisition.
While the timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon the amount and timing of our taxable income, we expect that the payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be substantial. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and such tax reporting positions are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. Payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be returned upon a successful challenge by a taxing authority to our reporting positions, although such excess payments made to the Vertiv Stockholder may be netted against payments otherwise to be made to the Vertiv Stockholder after our determination of such excess. Any payments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us.
The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to the Vertiv Stockholder of 65% of the cash tax savings realized (or deemed realized) over a 12-year period after the closing of the Business Combination as described above. In the twelfth year of the Tax Receivable Agreement, an additional payment will be made to the Vertiv Stockholder based on 65% of the remaining tax benefits that have not been realized. The timing of expected future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are dependent upon various factors, including the existing tax bases at the time of the Business Combination, the realization of tax benefits, and changes in tax laws. However, as the Company is obligated to settle the remaining tax benefits after 12 years, the Company has concluded that the liability should be measured at fair value and recorded within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. The Company has estimated total payments of approximately $191.5 on an undiscounted basis.
Subscription Agreements
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the PIPE Investors purchased an aggregate of 123,900,000 shares of the Class A common stock in a private placement for a price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,239.0.
The shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the Subscription Agreements (the “PIPE Shares”) were not registered under the Securities Act, and were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration requirements thereof provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
The Subscription Agreements for the PIPE Investors (other than (1) the PIPE Investors who are RRA Parties, whose registration rights are governed by the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, and (2) Subscribing Vertiv Executives) (the “Non-Sponsor PIPE Investors”) provide for certain registration rights. In particular, the Company is required to, as soon as practicable but no later than, (i) 45 calendar days following the closing date of the Business Combination and (ii) 90 calendar days following the Company’s most recent fiscal year end, file with the SEC (at the Company’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of such shares, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day following the actual filing date if the SEC notifies the Company that it will “review” such registration statement and (ii) the 10th business day after the date the Company is notified in writing by the SEC that such registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review. Such registration statement is required to be kept effective for at least two years after effectiveness or until the shares thereunder have been sold by the Non-Sponsor PIPE Investors. In addition, the Non-Sponsor PIPE Investors that purchase shares for an aggregate purchase price in excess of $100.0 also will be entitled to make up to two demands in the aggregate for traditional underwritten registrations, plus up to two demands in the aggregate for block trades, in any 12 month period immediately following the closing date of the Business Combination, in each case subject to certain thresholds, and will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights. The Registration Statement on Form S-1 was filed to fulfill the Company’s obligations under these Subscription Agreements.
