ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (including its operating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation) (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an international franchisor, confectionery manufacturer and retail operator. Founded in 1981, we are headquartered in Durango, Colorado and manufacture an extensive line of premium chocolate candies and other confectionery products. Our subsidiary, U-Swirl International, Inc., franchises and operates self-serve frozen yogurt cafés. Our revenues and profitability are derived principally from our franchised/license system of retail stores that feature chocolate, frozen yogurt and other confectionary products. We also sell our candy in selected locations outside of our system of retail stores and license the use of our brand with certain consumer products. As of March 31, 2017, there were four Company-owned, 83 licensee-owned and 283 franchised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores operating in 40 states, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates. As of March 31, 2017, U-Swirl operated five Company-owned cafés, 105 franchised cafés and 40 licensed locations located in 33 states and Canada. U-Swirl operates self-serve frozen yogurt cafés under the names “U-Swirl,” “Yogurtini,” “CherryBerry,” “Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt,” “Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt,” “Let’s Yo!” and “Aspen Leaf Yogurt”. 
 
Effective March 1, 2015, we reorganized to create a holding company structure. Our operating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“RMCF”), which was previously the public company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a newly formed entity, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Newco”), and all of the outstanding shares of common stock of RMCF were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of common stock of Newco. Our new holding company began trading on March 2, 2015 on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “RMCF”, which was the same symbol used by RMCF prior to the holding company reorganization.
 
In January 2013, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Aspen Leaf Yogurt, LLC (“ALY”), we entered into two agreements to sell all of the assets of our ALY frozen yogurt stores, along with our interest in the self-serve frozen yogurt franchises and retail units branded as “Yogurtini” which we also acquired in January 2013, to U-Swirl, Inc., a publicly traded company (OTCQB: SWRL) (“SWRL”), in exchange for a 60% controlling equity interest in SWRL, which was subsequently diluted down to 39% as of February 28, 2017 following various issuances of common stock of SWRL. At that time, U-Swirl International, Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of SWRL, and was the operating subsidiary for all of SWRL’s operations. Upon completion of these transactions, we ceased at the time to directly operate any Company-owned Aspen Leaf Yogurt locations or sell and support frozen yogurt franchise locations, which were being supported by SWRL. 
 
In fiscal year (“FY”) 2014, SWRL acquired the franchise rights and certain other assets of self-serve frozen yogurt concepts under the names “CherryBerry,” “Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt” and “Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt.” In connection with these acquisitions, the Company entered into a credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. used to finance the acquisitions of SWRL, and in turn, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with SWRL to cover the purchase price and other costs associated with the acquisitions (the “SWRL Loan Agreement”). Borrowings under the SWRL Loan Agreement were secured by all of the assets of SWRL, including all of the outstanding stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, U-Swirl International, Inc. Under the SWRL Loan Agreement, SWRL was subject to various financial covenants. SWRL was not compliant with the financial covenants during the year ended February 29, 2016 and the loan matured on January 16, 2016 without payment in full by SWRL. As a result of the defaults, we issued a demand for payment of all obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement. SWRL was unable to repay the obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement, and as a result, we foreclosed on all of the outstanding stock of U-Swirl International, Inc. as of February 29, 2016 in full satisfaction of the amounts owed under the SWRL Loan Agreement. This resulted in U-Swirl International, Inc. (“U-Swirl”) becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company as of February 29, 2016, at which time we began operating the frozen yogurt business of U-Swirl. U-Swirl currently operates self-serve frozen yogurt cafes under the names “U-Swirl,” “Yogurtini,” “CherryBerry,” “Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt,” “Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt,” “Let’s Yo!” and “Aspen Leaf Yogurt”.
 
Approximately 53% of the products sold at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores are prepared on the premises. We believe that in-store preparation of products creates a special store ambiance, and the aroma and sight of products being made attracts foot traffic and assures customers that products are fresh.
Our principal competitive strengths lie in our brand name recognition, our reputation for the quality, variety and taste of our products, the special ambiance of our stores, our knowledge and experience in applying criteria for selection of new store locations, our expertise in the manufacture of chocolate candy products and the merchandising and marketing of confectionary products, and the control and training infrastructures we have implemented to assure consistent customer service and execution of successful practices and techniques at our stores.
 
We believe our manufacturing expertise and reputation for quality has facilitated the sale of selected products through specialty markets. We are currently selling our products in a select number of specialty markets including wholesale, fundraising, corporate sales, mail order, private label and internet sales.

U-Swirl cafés and associated brands are designed to be attractive to customers by offering the following: 
 
● | inside café-style seating for 50 people and outside patio seating, where feasible and appropriate;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | spacious surroundings of 1,800 to 3,000 square feet;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | 8 to 16 flavors of frozen yogurt;
--+----------------------------------


● | up to 70 toppings; and
--+-----------------------


● | self-serve format allowing guests to create their own favorite snack.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that these characteristics provide U-Swirl with the ability to compete successfully in the retail frozen yogurt industry. While U-Swirl continues to pursue locations with the characteristics described above, we recognize that its acquisition strategy may lead U-Swirl to purchase competitors with diverse layouts.
 
The trade dress of the Aspen Leaf Yogurt, CherryBerry, Yogli Mogli, Fuzzy Peach, Let’s Yo! and Yogurtini locations are similar to that of U-Swirl, although their locations use different color schemes and are typically smaller than the U-Swirl cafés.
 
Our consolidated revenues are primarily derived from three principal sources: (i) sales to franchisees and other third parties of chocolates and other confectionery products manufactured by us (66%-65%-62%); (ii) sales at Company-owned stores of chocolates, other confectionery products and frozen yogurt (including products manufactured by us) (12%-12%-15%) and (iii) the collection of initial franchise fees and royalties from franchisees (22%-23%-23%). Approximately 97% of our revenues are derived from domestic sources, with 3% derived from international sources. The figures in parentheses above show the percentage of total revenues attributable to each source for the FY 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
According to industry data, the total U.S. candy market approximated $35.8 billion of retail sales in 2015 with chocolate generating sales of approximately $21.6 billion and candy sales per capita of $111.16, an increase of 2.8% when compared to 2014. 
 
According to Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts in the U.S. 9th Edition, published in January 2017 by Packaged Facts, in 2016 the U.S. market for ice cream and related frozen desserts, including frozen yogurt and frozen novelties, grew to $28 billion. 
 
Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to build on our position as a leading international franchisor and manufacturer of high quality chocolate, other confectionery products and frozen yogurt. We continually seek opportunities to profitably expand our business. To accomplish this objective, we employ a business strategy that includes the elements set forth below.
Product Quality and Variety

We maintain gourmet taste and quality of our chocolate candies by using only the finest chocolate and other wholesome ingredients. We use our own proprietary recipes, primarily developed by our master candy makers. A typical Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store offers up to 100 of our chocolate candies throughout the year and as many as 200, including many packaged candies, during the holiday seasons. Individual stores also offer numerous varieties of premium fudge and gourmet caramel apples, as well as other products prepared in the store from Company recipes. 
Store Atmosphere and Ambiance
 
We seek to establish an enjoyable and inviting atmosphere in each of our stores. Each Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store prepares numerous products, including fudge, barks and caramel apples, in the store. In-store preparation is designed to be both fun and entertaining for customers and to convey an image of freshness and homemade quality. Our design staff has developed easily replicable designs and specifications to ensure that the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory concept is consistently implemented at each store.
Site Selection
 
Careful selection of a site is critical to the success of our stores. We consider many factors in identifying suitable sites, including tenant mix, visibility, attractiveness, accessibility, level of foot traffic and occupancy costs. Final site selection occurs only after our senior management has approved the site. We believe that the experience of our management team in evaluating a potential site is one of our competitive strengths. 
Customer Service Commitment
 
We emphasize excellence in customer service in our stores and cafés and seek to employ and to sell franchises to motivated and energetic people. We also foster enthusiasm for our customer service philosophy and our concepts through our regional meetings and other frequent contacts with our franchisees. Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory holds a biennial convention for franchisees.

Increase Same Store Retail Sales at Existing Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Locations
 
We seek to increase profitability of our store system through increasing sales at existing store locations. Changes in system wide domestic same store retail sales at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory locations are as follows:

2013 | 0.2 | %
-----+-----+--
2014 | 1.2 | %
2015 | 3.1 | %
2016 | 1.6 | %
2017 | 0.9 | %

 
Changes in system wide domestic same store retail sales at frozen yogurt franchise locations are as follows:
 

2013 | * | 
-----+---+------
2014 | * | 
2015 | * | 
2016 | | (1.4% | )
2017 | | (3.0% | )

 
*Same store sales for acquired brands are reported after 24 months of operation as a part of our network of domestic franchise stores. Because the majority of our frozen yogurt franchise brands were acquired in January 2014, the earliest period same store sales are reported is for FY 2016.
 
We have designed a contemporary and coordinated line of packaged products that we believe capture and convey the freshness, fun and excitement of the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory retail store experience. We also believe that the successful launch of new packaging has had a positive impact on same store sales.
Increase Same Store Pounds Purchased by Existing Locations
 
In FY 2017, same store pounds purchased by franchisees and licensees declined 4.7% compared to the prior fiscal year. We continue to add new products and focus our existing product lines in an effort to increase same store pounds purchased by existing locations. We believe historical decreases in same store pounds purchased were due, in part, to a product mix shift from factory-made products to products made in the store such as caramel apples. 
Enhanced Operating Efficiencies
 
We seek to improve our profitability by controlling costs and increasing the efficiency of our operations. Efforts in the last several years include: the purchase of additional automated factory equipment, implementation of a comprehensive Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) system for production scheduling, implementation of alternative manufacturing strategies and installation of enhanced Point-of-Sale (POS) systems in all of our Company-owned and the majority of our franchised stores. These measures have significantly improved our ability to deliver our products to our stores safely, quickly and cost-effectively and impact store operations.
Acquisition Opportunities
 
We plan to evaluate other businesses and opportunities that would be complementary to our business, including both our candy products and the frozen yogurt business. Beginning in January 2013 with the acquisition of a controlling interest in SWRL, we began an initiative to improve profitability through the acquisition of self-serve frozen yogurt franchise systems. We believe that the rapid growth of the self-serve frozen yogurt market has created a highly fragmented franchise environment. We believe we can leverage the strategies we’ve developed over time to improve our profitability and bring the benefits of scale to smaller franchisors. During FY 2013 and FY 2014, we acquired Yogurtini, CherryBerry, Yogli Mogli and Fuzzy Peach frozen yogurt concepts. During FY 2016, we acquired the Let’s Yo! Frozen Yogurt concept. 
Expansion Strategy
 
We are continually exploring opportunities to grow our brand and expand our business. Key elements of our expansion strategy are set forth below. 
 
Unit Growth
 
We continue to pursue unit growth opportunities, despite the difficult financing environment for our concepts, in locations where we have traditionally been successful, to pursue new and developing real estate environments for franchisees which appear promising based on early sales results, and to improve and expand our retail store concepts, such that previously untapped and unfeasible environments generate sufficient revenue to support a successful Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory or U-Swirl location.

High Traffic Environments
 
We currently establish franchised stores in the following environments: outlet centers, tourist environments, regional centers, street fronts, airports, other entertainment-oriented environments and strip centers. We have established a business relationship with most of the major developers in the United States and believe that these relationships provide us with the opportunity to take advantage of attractive sites in new and existing real estate environments. 
Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Name Recognition and New Market Penetration
 
We believe the visibility of our stores and the high foot traffic at many of our locations has generated strong name recognition of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory and demand for our franchises. The Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory system has historically been concentrated in the western and Rocky Mountain region of the United States, but growth has generated a gradual easterly momentum as new stores have been opened in the eastern half of the country. We believe this growth has further increased our name recognition and demand for our franchises. Distribution of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products through specialty markets also increases name recognition and brand awareness in areas of the country in which we have not previously had a significant presence. We believe that distributing selected Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products through specialty markets also increases our name brand recognition and will improve and benefit our entire store system.
 
We seek to establish a fun and inviting atmosphere in our store locations. Unlike most other confectionery stores, each Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store prepares certain products, including fudge and caramel apples, in the store. Customers can observe store personnel making fudge from start to finish, including the mixing of ingredients in old-fashioned copper kettles and the cooling of the fudge on large granite or marble tables, and are often invited to sample the store's products. An average of approximately 53% of the revenues of franchised stores are generated by sales of products prepared on the premises. We believe the in-store preparation and aroma of our products enhance the ambiance at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores, are fun and entertaining for our customers and convey an image of freshness and homemade quality. 
 
To ensure that all stores conform to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory image, our design staff provides working drawings and specifications and approves the construction plans for each new store. We also control the signage and building materials that may be used in the stores.
 
The average store size is approximately 1,000 square feet, approximately 650 square feet of which is selling space. Most stores are open seven days a week. Typical hours are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and 12 noon to 6 p.m. on Sundays. Store hours in tourist areas may vary depending upon the tourist season.
 
In January 2007, we began testing co-branded locations, such as the co-branded stores with Cold Stone Creamery. Co-branding a location is a vehicle to exploit retail environments that would not typically support a stand-alone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store. Co-branding can also be used to more efficiently manage rent structure, payroll and other operating costs in environments that have not historically supported stand-alone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores. As of February 28, 2017, our partner’s franchisees operated 83 co-branded locations, our franchisees operated 16 locations and three Company-owned co-branded units were in operation.
 
We have previously entered into franchise developments and licensing agreements for the expansion of our franchise stores in Canada, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, The Republic of the Philippines and Japan. We believe that international opportunities may create a favorable expansion strategy and reduce dependence on domestic franchise openings to achieve growth. 
 
International units in operation were as follows at March 31, 2017:
 

Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory | 
------------------------------------------------+---
Canada | 64
Japan | 5 
The Republic of the Philippines | 3 
South Korea | 18
United Arab Emirates | 4 
U-Swirl Cafés (Including all associated brands) | 
Canada | 2 
Total | 96

Products and Packaging
 
We produce approximately 350 chocolate candies and other confectionery products, using proprietary recipes developed primarily by our master candy makers. These products include many varieties of clusters, caramels, creams, mints and truffles. We continue to engage in a major effort to expand our product line by developing additional exciting and attractive new products. During the Christmas, Easter and Valentine's Day holiday seasons, we may make as many as 130 additional items, including many candies offered in packages specially designed for the holidays. A typical Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store offers up to 100 of these candies throughout the year and up to an additional 100 during holiday seasons. Individual stores also offer more than 15 varieties of caramel apples and other products prepared in the store. On average, approximately 42% of the revenues of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores are generated by products manufactured at our factory, 53% by products made in individual stores using our recipes and ingredients purchased from us or approved suppliers and the remaining 5% by products such as ice cream, coffee and other sundries, purchased from approved suppliers.
Approximately 31% of our product sales result from the sale of products outside of our system of franchised and licensed locations (specialty markets). The majority of sales outside our system of franchised and licensed locations are the result of a single customer. In the twelve months ended February 28, 2017, this customer represented 52% of total shipments to specialty markets. These products are produced using the same quality ingredients and manufacturing processes as the products sold in our network of retail stores.   
We use only the finest chocolates, nutmeats and other wholesome ingredients in our candies and continually strive to offer new confectionery items in order to maintain the excitement and appeal of our products. We develop special packaging for the Christmas, Valentine's Day and Easter holidays, and customers can have their purchases packaged in decorative boxes and fancy tins throughout the year. 
 
Chocolate candies that we manufacture are sold at prices ranging from $17.90 to $28.95 per pound, with an average price of $21.98 per pound. Franchisees set their own retail prices, though we do recommend prices for all of our products. 
 
Our frozen yogurt cafés feature a high quality yogurt that we believe is superior to products offered by many of our competitors. Our product is nationally distributed and consistent among our cafés. Most cafés feature 8-16 flavor varieties, including custom and seasonal specialty flavors. Our toppings bars feature up to 70 toppings allowing for a customizable frozen dessert experience. Cafés typically sell frozen yogurt by the ounce with prices generally ranging between $0.44 and $0.59 per ounce.
 
Operating Environment
 
We currently establish Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in six primary environments: regional centers, tourist areas, outlet centers, street fronts, airports and other entertainment-oriented shopping centers. Each of these environments has a number of attractive features, including high levels of foot traffic. Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory domestic franchise locations in operation as of February 28, 2017 include:

Regional Centers | 23.3 | %
---------------------------+------+--
Outlet Centers | 22.8 | %
Festival/Community Centers | 20.1 | %
Tourist Areas | 15.9 | %
Street Fronts | 7.4 | %
Airports | 4.2 | %
Other | 6.3 | %

Regional Centers
 
As of February 28, 2017, there were Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in approximately 44 regional centers, including a location in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. Although often providing favorable levels of foot traffic, regional centers typically involve more expensive rent structures and competing food and beverage concepts. 
Outlet Centers
 
We have established business relationships with most of the major outlet center developers in the United States. Although not all factory outlet centers provide desirable locations for our stores, we believe our relationships with these developers will provide us with the opportunity to take advantage of attractive sites in new and existing outlet centers.
Tourist Areas, Street Fronts and Other Entertainment-Oriented Shopping Centers
 
As of February 28, 2017, there were approximately 30 Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in locations considered to be tourist areas, including Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, California and the River Walk in San Antonio, Texas. Tourist areas are very attractive locations because they offer high levels of foot traffic and favorable customer spending characteristics, and greatly increase our visibility and name recognition. 
 
 7



Other Environments
 
We believe there are a number of other environments that have the characteristics necessary for the successful operation of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores such as airports and sports arenas. Eight franchised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores exist at airport locations. 
 
Strip/Convenience Centers
 
Our self-serve frozen yogurt locations are primarily located in strip and convenience center locations. Such centers generally have convenient parking and feature many retail entities without enclosed connecting walkways. Such centers generally offer favorable rents and the ability to operate during hours when other operating environments are closed, such as late at night.
Franchising Program
 
General
 
Our franchising philosophy is one of service and commitment to our franchise system, and we continuously seek to improve our franchise support services. Our concept has been rated as an outstanding franchise opportunity by publications and organizations rating such opportunities. In January 2011, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory was rated the number one franchise opportunity in the candy category by Entrepreneur Magazine (the last publication of this category ranking). As of March 31, 2017, there were 283 franchised stores in the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory system and 105 franchised stores under the U-Swirl frozen yogurt brands. We strive to bring this philosophy of service and commitment to all of our franchised brands and believe this strategy gives us a competitive advantage in the support of frozen yogurt franchises.
Franchisee Sourcing and Selection
 
The majority of new franchises are awarded to persons referred by existing franchisees, to interested consumers who have visited Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores and to existing franchisees. We also advertise for new franchisees in national and regional newspapers as suitable potential store locations come to our attention. Franchisees are approved by us on the basis of the applicant's net worth and liquidity, together with an assessment of work ethic and personality compatibility with our operating philosophy.
International Franchising and Licensing
 
In FY 1992, we entered into a franchise development agreement covering Canada with Immaculate Confections, Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia (“Immaculate Confections”). Pursuant to this agreement, Immaculate Confections purchased the exclusive right to franchise and operate Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in Canada. As of March 31, 2017, Immaculate Confections operated 64 stores under this agreement. 
 
In FY 2000, we entered into a franchise development agreement covering the Gulf Cooperation Council States of United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman with Al Muhairy Group of United Arab Emirates (“Al Muhairy Group”). Pursuant to this agreement, Al Muhairy Group purchased the exclusive right to franchise and operate Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in the Gulf Cooperation Council States. As of March 31, 2017, Al Muhairy Group operated four stores under this agreement.

Our business was significantly affected by the global recession during 2008-2009. During this period there was a decrease in leads and qualified franchisees for domestic franchise growth. Amidst this environment we initiated a program to focus on international expansion. International growth is generally achieved through entry into a Master License Agreement covering specific countries, with a licensee that meets minimum qualifications to develop Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, or a brand of U-Swirl in that country. License agreements are generally entered into for a period of 3-10 years and allow the licensee exclusive development rights in a country. Generally we require an initial license fee and commitment to a development schedule. International license agreements in place at February 28, 2017 include the following: 
 

● | In April 2012, we entered into a Master Licensing Agreement covering the country of Japan with a strategic licensee based in Hong Kong. As of March 31, 2017, five units were operating under this agreement. The licensee has not developed Japan in accordance with the development schedule set forth in the agreement and we are currently evaluating ways to retain licensee operations in Japan.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In March 2013, we entered into a Licensing Agreement in the country of South Korea. As of March 31, 2017, 18 units were operating under this agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | In October 2014, we entered into a Licensing Agreement in the Republic of the Philippines. As of March 31, 2017 three units were operating under the agreement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Through our U-Swirl subsidiary, we have an additional international development agreement covering Canada.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Co-branding
 
In August 2009, we entered into a Master License Agreement with Kahala Franchise Corp. Under the terms of the agreement, select current and future Cold Stone Creamery franchise stores are co-branded with both the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory and the Cold Stone Creamery brands. Locations developed or modified under the agreement are subject to the approval of both parties. Locations developed or modified under the agreement will remain franchisees of Cold Stone Creamery and will be licensed to offer the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory brand.  As of March 31, 2017, Cold Stone Creamery franchisees operated 83 stores under this agreement. 
 
Additionally, we allow U-Swirl brands to offer Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products under terms similar to other co-branding agreements. As of March 31, 2017, there were 19 franchise and Company-owned U-Swirl cafés offering Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory products.
 
Training and Support
 
Each domestic franchisee owner/operator and each store manager for a domestic franchisee is required to complete a comprehensive training program in store operations and management. We have established a training center at our Durango headquarters in the form of a full-sized replica of a properly configured and merchandised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store. U-Swirl franchisees are required to complete a similar training program. Topics covered in the training course include our philosophy of store operation and management, customer service, merchandising, pricing, cooking, inventory and cost control, quality standards, record keeping, labor scheduling and personnel management. Training is based on standard operating policies and procedures contained in an operations manual provided to all franchisees, which the franchisee is required to follow by terms of the franchise agreement. Additionally, and importantly, trainees are provided with a complete orientation to our operations by working in key factory operational areas and by meeting with members of our senior management.
Our operating objectives include providing knowledge and expertise in merchandising, marketing and customer service to all front-line store level employees to maximize their skills and ensure that they are fully versed in our proven techniques.
We provide ongoing support to franchisees through our field consultants, who maintain regular and frequent communication with the stores by phone and by site visits. The field consultants also review and discuss with the franchisee store operating results and provide advice and guidance in improving store profitability and in developing and executing store marketing and merchandising programs. 
Quality Standards and Control
 
The franchise agreement for Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchisees requires compliance with our procedures of operation and food quality specifications and permits audits and inspections by us.
 
Operating standards for Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores are set forth in operating manuals. These manuals cover general operations, factory ordering, merchandising, advertising and accounting procedures. Through their regular visits to franchised stores, our field consultants audit performance and adherence to our standards. We have the right to terminate any franchise agreement for non-compliance with our operating standards. Products sold at the stores and ingredients used in the preparation of products approved for on-site preparation must be purchased from us or from approved suppliers.
The Franchise Agreement: Terms and Conditions

The domestic offer and sale of our franchise concepts are made pursuant to the respective Franchise Disclosure Document prepared in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations. States that regulate the sale and operation of franchises require a franchisor to register or file certain notices with the state authorities prior to offering and selling franchises in those states.
 
Under the current form of our domestic franchise agreements, franchisees pay us (i) an initial franchise fee for each store, (ii) royalties based on monthly gross sales, and (iii) a marketing fee based on monthly gross sales. Franchisees are generally granted exclusive territory with respect to the operation of their stores only in the immediate vicinity of their stores. Chocolate and yogurt products not made on the premises by franchisees must be purchased from us or approved suppliers. The franchise agreements require franchisees to comply with our procedures of operation and food quality specifications, to permit inspections and audits by us and to remodel stores to conform with standards then in effect. We may terminate the franchise agreement upon the failure of the franchisee to comply with the conditions of the agreement and upon the occurrence of certain events, such as insolvency or bankruptcy of the franchisee or the commission by the franchisee of any unlawful or deceptive practice, which in our judgment is likely to adversely affect the system. Our ability to terminate franchise agreements pursuant to such provisions is subject to applicable bankruptcy and state laws and regulations. See "Business - Regulation."

The agreements prohibit the transfer or assignment of any interest in a franchise without our prior written consent. The agreements also give us a right of first refusal to purchase any interest in a franchise if a proposed transfer would result in a change of control of that franchise. The refusal right, if exercised, would allow us to purchase the interest proposed to be transferred under the same terms and conditions and for the same price as offered by the proposed transferee.
 
The term of each franchise agreement is ten years, and franchisees have the right to renew for one additional ten-year term.
 
Franchise Financing
 
We do not typically provide prospective franchisees with financing for their stores, but we have developed relationships with several sources of franchisee financing to whom we will refer franchisees. Typically, franchisees have obtained their own sources of such financing and have not required our assistance.
 
During FY 2014, we began an initiative to finance entrepreneurial graduates of the Missouri Western State University (“MWSU”) entrepreneurial program. Beginning in FY 2010, recent graduates were awarded the opportunity to own a Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchise under favorable financing terms. Prior to FY 2014, the financing was provided by an independent benefactor of the MWSU School of Business. Beginning in FY 2014, we began to finance the graduates directly, under similar terms as the previous financing facility. This program has generally included financing for the purchase of formerly Company-owned locations or for the purchase of underperforming franchise locations. As of February 28, 2017, approximately $460,000 was included in notes receivable as a result of this program. As of March 31, 2017, there were 18 units in operation by graduates of the MWSU entrepreneurial program.
 
Licensee Financing
 
During FY 2011, we began a program to finance the remodel costs of a select number of co-branded licensed Cold Stone Creamery locations. The financing was provided to existing Cold Stone Creamery franchisees that were required to meet a number of financial qualifications prior to approval. At February 28, 2017, approximately $49,000 was included in notes receivable as a result of this program.
Company Store Program
 
As of March 31, 2017, there were four company-owned Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores and five company-owned U-Swirl cafés. Company-owned stores provide a training ground for Company-owned store personnel and district managers and a controllable testing ground for new products and promotions, operating and training methods and merchandising techniques, which may then be incorporated into the franchise store operations.
 
Managers of company-owned stores are required to comply with all Company operating standards and undergo training and receive support from us similar to the training and support provided to franchisees. See "Franchising Program-Training and Support" and "Franchising Program-Quality Standards and Control."

We manufacture our chocolate candies at our factory in Durango, Colorado. All products are produced consistent with our philosophy of using only the finest high quality ingredients to achieve our marketing motto of "The Peak of Perfection in Handmade Chocolates®." 
 
We have always believed that we should control the manufacturing of our own chocolate products. By controlling manufacturing, we can better maintain our high product quality standards, offer unique, proprietary products, manage costs, control production and shipment schedules and potentially pursue new or under-utilized distribution channels.
 
Manufacturing Processes
 
The manufacturing process primarily involves cooking or preparing candy centers, including nuts, caramel, peanut butter, creams and jellies, and then coating them with chocolate or other toppings. All of these processes are conducted in carefully controlled temperature ranges, and we employ strict quality control procedures at every stage of the manufacturing process. We use a combination of manual and automated processes at our factory. Although we believe that it is currently preferable to perform certain manufacturing processes, such as dipping of some large pieces by hand, automation increases the speed and efficiency of the manufacturing process. We have from time to time automated processes formerly performed by hand where it has become cost-effective for us to do so without compromising product quality or appearance.

We seek to ensure the freshness of products sold in Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores with frequent shipments. Most Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores do not have significant space for the storage of inventory, and we encourage franchisees and store managers to order only the quantities that they can reasonably expect to sell within approximately two to four weeks. For these reasons, we generally do not have a significant backlog of orders.
 
Ingredients
 
The principal ingredients used in our products are chocolate, nuts, sugar, corn syrup, cream and butter. The factory receives shipments of ingredients daily. To ensure the consistency of our products, we buy ingredients from a limited number of reliable suppliers. In order to assure a continuous supply of chocolate and certain nuts, we frequently enter into purchase contracts of between six to eighteen months for these products. Because prices for these products may fluctuate, we may benefit if prices rise during the terms of these contracts, but we may be required to pay above-market prices if prices fall. We have one or more alternative sources for most essential ingredients and therefore believe that the loss of any supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We currently purchase small amounts of finished candy from third parties on a private label basis for sale in Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores.
Trucking Operations
 
We operate eight trucks and ship a substantial portion of our products from the factory on our own fleet. Our trucking operations enable us to deliver our products to the stores quickly and cost-effectively. In addition, we back-haul our own ingredients and supplies, as well as products from third parties, on return trips, which helps achieve even greater efficiencies and cost savings.
Marketing
 
General
 
We rely primarily on in-store promotion and point-of-purchase materials to promote the sale of our products. The monthly marketing fees collected from franchisees are used by us to develop new packaging and in-store promotion and point-of-purchase materials, and to create and update our local store marketing handbooks.
 
We focus on local store marketing efforts by providing customizable marketing materials, including advertisements, coupons, flyers and mail order catalogs generated by our in-house Creative Services department. The department works directly with franchisees to implement local store marketing programs.
 
We have not historically, and do not intend to, engage in national traditional media advertising in the near future. Consistent with our commitment to community support, we aggressively seek opportunities to participate in local and regional events, sponsorships and charitable causes. This support leverages low cost, high return publicity opportunities for mutual gain partnerships. Through programs such as Fudge for Troops, and collaborations with Sylvan Learning Centers and other national/local organizations focused on youth/leadership development and underserved populations in our community we have developed relationships that define our principal platforms, and contribute to charitable causes that provide great benefits at a national level. 
 
Internet and Social Media
 
Beginning in 2010, we initiated a program to leverage the marketing benefits of various social media outlets. These low cost marketing opportunities seek to leverage the positive feedback of our customers to expand brand awareness through a customer’s network of contacts. Complementary to local store marketing efforts, these networks also provide a medium for us to communicate regularly and authentically with customers. When possible, we work to facilitate direct relationships between our franchisees and their customers. We use social media as a powerful tool to build brand recognition, increase repeat exposure and enhance dialogue with consumers about their preferences and needs. To date, the majority of stores have location specific websites and location specific Facebook® pages dedicated to help customers interact directly with their local store. Proceeds from the monthly marketing fees collected from franchisees are used by us to facilitate and assist stores in managing their online presence consistent with our brand and marketing efforts.
Licensing
 
We have developed relationships and utilized licensing partners to leverage the equity of the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory brand. These licensed products place our brand and story in front of consumers in environments where they regularly shop but may not be seeing our brand at present. We regularly review product opportunities and selectively pursue those we believe will have the greatest impact. The most recent example is the announcement of our Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Chocolatey Almond breakfast cereal manufactured, marketed, and distributed by Kellogg’s Company. Some of our specialty markets customers (customers outside our system of franchised domestic retail locations) have worked with us to offer licensed products alongside products we produce to further enhance brand placement and awareness.

Competition
 
The retailing of confectionery and frozen dessert products is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with numerous businesses that offer products similar to those our stores offer. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition and financial, marketing and other resources than us. In addition, there is intense competition among retailers for real estate sites, store personnel and qualified franchisees. 
We believe that our principal competitive strengths lie in our name recognition and our reputation for the quality, value, variety and taste of our products and the special ambiance of our stores; our knowledge and experience in applying criteria for selection of new store locations; our expertise in merchandising and marketing of chocolate and other candy products; and the control and training infrastructures we have implemented to assure execution of successful practices and techniques at our store locations. In addition, by controlling the manufacturing of our own chocolate products, we can better maintain our high product quality standards for those products, offer proprietary products, manage costs, control production and shipment schedules and pursue new or under-utilized distribution channels.
Trade Name and Trademarks
 
The trade name "Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory®," the phrases, "The Peak of Perfection in Handmade Chocolates®", "America's Chocolatier®”, “The World’s Chocolatier®” as well as all other trademarks, service marks, symbols, slogans, emblems, logos and designs used in the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory system, are our proprietary rights. We believe that all of the foregoing are of material importance to our business. The registration for the trademark “Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory” is registered in the United States and Canada. Applications have been filed to register the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory trademark and/or obtained in certain foreign countries. 
 
In connection with U-Swirl’s frozen yogurt café operations, the following marks are owned by U-Swirl and have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office: “U-Swirl Frozen Yogurt And Design”; “U-Swirl Frozen Yogurt”; “U-Swirl”; “U and Design”; “Worth The Weight”; “Frequent Swirler”; “Yogurtini”; “CherryBerry Self-Serve Yogurt Bar”; “Yogli Mogli”; “Best on the Planet”; “Fuzzy Peach”; “U-Swirl-N-Go”; and “Serve Yo Self”. The “U-Swirl Frozen Yogurt and Design” (a logo) is also registered in Mexico and U-Swirl has a registration for “U-Swirl” in Canada. 
 
We have not attempted to obtain patent protection for the proprietary recipes developed by our master candy-maker and instead rely upon our ability to maintain the confidentiality of those recipes.
 
Employees
 
At February 28, 2017, we employed approximately 280 people. Most employees, with the exception of store management, factory management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. We also employ some people on a temporary basis during peak periods of store and factory operations. We seek to assure that participatory management processes, mutual respect and professionalism and high performance expectations for the employee exist throughout the organization. We believe that we provide working conditions, wages and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Seasonal Factors
 
Our sales and earnings are seasonal, with significantly higher sales and earnings occurring during key holidays and the summer vacation season than at other times of the year, which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. In addition, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings, the sale of franchises and the timing of purchases by customers outside our network of franchised locations. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year.
Regulation
 
Company-owned Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores and Company-owned U-Swirl cafés are subject to licensing and regulation by the health, sanitation, safety, building and fire agencies in the state or municipality where located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licensing or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of new stores. New stores must also comply with landlord and developer criteria.
 
Many states have laws regulating franchise operations, including registration and disclosure requirements in the offer and sale of franchises. We are also subject to the Federal Trade Commission regulations relating to disclosure requirements in the sale of franchises and ongoing disclosure obligations.
 
Additionally, certain states have enacted and others may enact laws and regulations governing the termination or non-renewal of franchises and other aspects of the franchise relationship that are intended to protect franchisees. Although these laws and regulations, and related court decisions, may limit our ability to terminate franchises and alter franchise agreements, we do not believe that such laws or decisions will have a material adverse effect on our franchise operations. However, the laws applicable to franchise operations and relationships continue to develop, and we are unable to predict the effect on our intended operations of additional requirements or restrictions that may be enacted or of court decisions that may be adverse to franchisors.

Federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material impact on our operations but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay construction of new stores.
 
Companies engaged in the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of food products are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental agencies. A finding of a failure to comply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of all or a portion of our facilities for an indeterminate period of time. Our product labeling is subject to and complies with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 and the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004.
 
We provide a limited amount of trucking services to third parties, to fill available space on our trucks. Our trucking operations are subject to various federal and state regulations, including regulations of the Federal Highway Administration and other federal and state agencies applicable to motor carriers, safety requirements of the Department of Transportation relating to interstate transportation and federal, state and Canadian provincial regulations governing matters such as vehicle weight and dimensions.
 
We believe that we are operating in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
