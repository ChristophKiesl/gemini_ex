Industries Served 
NCR provides specific solutions for customers of varying sizes in a range of industries such as financial services, retail, hospitality, travel and telecommunications and technology. NCR’s solutions are built on a foundation of long-established industry knowledge and consulting expertise, value-added software and hardware technology, and global implementation, consulting and customer support services. 
Company History 
NCR was originally incorporated in 1884 and was a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange prior to its merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T Corp. (AT&T) on September 19, 1991. On December 31, 1996, AT&T distributed all of its interest in NCR to its stockholders. NCR common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “NCR”.
On September 30, 2007, NCR completed the spin-off of its Teradata Data Warehousing business through the distribution of a tax-free stock dividend to NCR stockholders. NCR distributed one share of common stock of Teradata Corporation for each share of NCR common stock to NCR stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 14, 2007. 
On August 24, 2011, NCR completed the acquisition of Radiant Systems, Inc. (Radiant). The acquisition was completed through a tender offer and subsequent merger. Radiant was a leading provider of technology solutions for managing site operations in the hospitality and specialty retail industries.
On February 6, 2013, NCR completed the acquisition of Retalix Ltd. (Retalix). Retalix was a leading global provider of innovative retail software and was subsequently integrated into NCR's omni-channel solution offerings for the retail industry. 
On January 10, 2014, NCR completed its acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation (Digital Insight). The Digital Insight acquisition and subsequent integration extended NCR's existing capabilities in the financial services industry to form a complete enterprise software platform across both physical and digital channels. 
Significant Transactions 
On May 27, 2016, NCR completed the sale of all but the Middle East and Africa (MEA) assets of its Interactive Printer Solutions (IPS) business to Atlas Holdings LLC for cash consideration of $47 million. In connection with the sale, NCR agreed to provide Atlas Holdings LLC with certain support services on a short-term basis following the closing under a transition services agreement. 
Operating Segments 
As of January 1, 2016, NCR began management of its business on a solution basis, changing from the previous model of management on a line of business basis. The new model is intended to drive improved execution on our software-driven business model, while allowing other revenue streams to contribute and add value towards our end-to-end solutions. As a result, we categorized our operations into three reportable segments: Software, Services and Hardware. 
This change to our segment reporting for fiscal year 2016 and future periods is further described in Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. The information required by Item 1 with respect to our reportable segments and financial information regarding our geographic areas and those reportable 
1

segments can be found in Item 7 of Part II of this Report under “Revenue and Operating Income by Segment” as well as in Item 8 of Part II of this Report as part of Note 13, “Segment Information and Concentrations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1A of this Report under "Multinational Operations," and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Products and Services 
We sell a portfolio of hardware, software and services that combine to provide businesses with solutions to connect, interact and transact with their customers. Our offerings fall into the following categories: 
Software Solutions
Our software offerings include industry-based software platforms such as our Cx Banking self-service ATM software application suite (providing ATM management systems) for financial services, our Retail ONE and Aloha Enterprise software application suites for the retail and hospitality industries, and NCR Silver, a cloud-based POS system for small businesses. We also provide a portfolio of other industry-oriented software applications, which include cash management software, video banking software, fraud and loss prevention applications, check and document imaging, remote-deposit capture, and customer-facing digital banking applications, such as web-enablement and bill payment (including mobile bill payment), for the financial services industry; and secure electronic and mobile payment solutions, sector-specific point of sale software applications for quick-service restaurants, gas stations and other businesses, and back-office inventory and store and restaurant management applications, for the retail and hospitality industries. We also provide in-depth industry and solution based consulting and professional services focused on bank branch, store and restaurant design and optimization, and cloud hosting services. Our software platforms and applications, which are delivered on software as a service (SaaS), enterprise license and other bases, are designed to work seamlessly together, with our hardware products, or as stand-alone solutions. Our software solutions deliver a consistent and rich consumer experience across channels, while enabling businesses to digitize and automate labor-intensive processes, reduce costs and increase productivity.
Services
Services are an essential and integrated component of NCR’s complete solution offerings to help companies increase availability and security of consumer touchpoints, improve operational efficiency and enhance the customer experience. We provide global end-to-end services from assessment and preparation, to staging, installation and implementation, and maintenance and support. We also provide systems management and complete managed services for our product offerings. We also provide Predictive Services, a managed services offering, which is designed to predict and address information technology issues quickly before they happen. In addition, we provide installation, maintenance and managed services for third party networking products to a broad base of customers in the telecommunications and technology sectors, and we service third party computer hardware from select manufacturers who value and leverage our global service capability.
Hardware Products
We provide financial institutions, retailers and independent deployers with a suite of financial-oriented self-service hardware products. Our financial services hardware products include multi-function ATMs, interactive teller machines (ITMs), thin-client ATMs, cash dispensers, cash recycling ATMs and hardware for check and image processing. Our financial services hardware products are designed to quickly, reliably and securely process consumer banking transactions while providing low cost of ownership, efficiency and a modernized consumer experience. We also provide retail- and hospitality-oriented hardware products such as point of sale terminals, self-checkout kiosks, order and payment kiosks, bar code scanners, printers and peripherals, to retailers, restaurants, food service companies and entertainment and sports venues worldwide. Our retail and hospitality hardware products are designed to improve operational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, streamline order and transaction processing and reduce operating costs. We also provide other self-service kiosks, such as self-check in/out kiosk solutions for airlines, hotels and casinos that allow guests to check in/out without assistance, wayfinding solutions (locating products or navigating through large, complex buildings and campuses), digital signage, bill payment kiosks and gift registries. These solutions create pleasant and convenient experiences for consumers and enable our customers to reduce costs. In addition, we resell third party networking products to a broad base of customers in the telecommunications and technology sectors.
Target Markets and Distribution Channels 
NCR provides its software, services and hardware solutions to customers of varying sizes in the financial services, retail, hospitality, travel and telecommunications and technology industries. 
Our financial solutions primarily serve the financial services industry with particular focus on retail banking, which includes traditional providers of consumer banking and financial services. These solutions also serve the retail markets through convenience banking products for retailers designed to complement their core businesses. Customers are located throughout the world in both developed 
2

and emerging markets. We have historically sold most of our financial solutions through a direct sales channel, although a portion of revenue is derived through distributors and value-added resellers. 
We provide self-service kiosk and POS solutions to the retail and hospitality industries. Retail customers include department stores, specialty retailers, mass merchandisers, catalog stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, grocery stores, drug stores, wholesalers, convenience stores, petroleum outlets and small businesses. Hospitality customers include retailers, restaurants and food service providers, and sports and entertainment venues (including stadiums, arenas and cinemas) and small businesses. We also provide our self-service solutions to customers in the travel industry, including airlines, airports, car rental companies, and hotel/lodging operators. Self-service kiosk and POS solutions are sold through a direct sales force and through relationships with value-added resellers, distributors, dealers and other indirect sales channels. 
We provide service and support for our products and solutions through services contracts with our customers. We have also established managed services contracts with key customers and continue to pursue additional managed services relationships. Longer term managed services arrangements can help improve the efficiency and performance of the customer’s business, and also increase the strategic and financial importance of its relationship with NCR. We also service competing technologies—for example, ToshibaTec retail technologies and Diebold Nixdorf ATMs. The primary sales channel for our services is our direct sales teams, which exist across all geographies where we operate around the world. Our services professionals provide these services directly to end customers. 
Competition 
We face a diverse group of competitors in the industries in which we sell our hardware, software and services solutions. The primary factors of competition can vary by geographic area where we operate around the world, but typically include: value and quality of the solutions or products; total cost of ownership; industry knowledge of the vendor; the vendor’s ability to provide and support a total end-to-end solution; the vendor’s ability to integrate new and existing systems; fit of the vendor’s strategic vision with the customer’s strategic direction; and quality of the vendor’s consulting, deployment and support services.
In the financial services industry, we face a variety of competitors, including Diebold Nixdorf Incorporated and Nautilus Hyosung, as well as many other regional firms, across all geographies where we operate around the world. Other competitors vary by product, service offering and geographic area, and include, among others, Fidelity National Information Services, Q2 Holdings and ACI Worldwide for imaging solutions. 
We also face a variety of competitors in the retail and hospitality industries across all geographies. Our competitors vary by market segment, product, service offering and geographic area, and include ToshibaTec, Diebold Nixdorf, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard Inc., Honeywell, Oracle, Manhattan Associates and Datalogic, among others. 
We face a diverse group of competitors in the travel industry. Competitors in the travel industry include Embross, SITA and IER, among others. 
We face competition for services from other technology and service providers, as well as from independent service operators, in all geographies where we operate around the world. The primary services competitors are the companies identified above, as global technology providers continue to focus on services as a core business strategy. We also compete with a range of regional and local independent service operators across our various geographies. 
Research and Development 
We remain focused on designing and developing solutions that anticipate our customers’ changing technological needs as well as consumer preferences. Our expenses for research and development were $242 million in 2016, $230 million in 2015, and $263 million in 2014. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future in order to provide a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services and to help maintain and enhance our competitive position. Information regarding the accounting and costs included in research and development activities is included in Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report under "Research and Development Costs," and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Patents and Trademarks 
NCR seeks patent protection for its innovations, including improvements, associated with its software, hardware, services, solutions, and developments, where such protection is likely to provide value to NCR. NCR owns more than 1,300 patents in the U.S. and numerous other patents in foreign countries. The foreign patents are generally counterparts of NCR’s U.S. patents. Many of the patents owned by NCR are licensed to others, and NCR is licensed under certain patents owned by others. NCR has active patent licensing and other monetization programs to drive additional value from its patent portfolio. NCR also has numerous patent applications pending in the U.S. and in foreign countries. NCR’s portfolio of patents and patent applications, in the aggregate, is of significant value to NCR. 
3

NCR has registered certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in a number of foreign countries. NCR considers the “NCR” and NCR logo marks and many of its other trademarks and service marks to be valuable assets.
Seasonality 
Our sales are historically seasonal, with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year. Such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on variability in the volume, timing and mix of sales. In addition, revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months. Information regarding seasonality and its potential impact on our business is included in Item 1A of this Report under the caption, “Operating Results Fluctuations,” and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials 
In most cases, there are a number of vendors providing the services and producing the parts and components that we utilize. However, there are some services and components that are purchased from single sources due to price, quality, technology or other reasons. For example, we depend on computer chips and microprocessors from Intel and operating systems from Microsoft. Certain parts and components used in the manufacturing of our ATMs and the delivery of many of our retail solutions are also supplied by single sources. In addition, there are a number of key suppliers for our businesses who provide us with critical products for our solutions.
At December 31, 2016, we manufactured our ATMs in facilities located in Columbus, Georgia, USA; Manaus, Brazil; Budapest, Hungary; Beijing, China; Puducherry, India and Chengalpattu, India. Our self-checkout solutions are manufactured in facilities located in Columbus, Georgia, USA and Budapest, Hungary. Our financial kiosk solutions are manufactured in facilities located in Beijing, China; Budapest, Hungary; Manaus, Brazil; Puducherry, India and Chengalpattu, India. Our POS terminals are manufactured in facilities located in Columbus, Georgia, USA; Beijing, China; Budapest, Hungary; Salzburg, Austria; and Adelaide, Australia, and certain hand-held solutions are manufactured in Salzburg, Austria. NCR outsources the manufacturing of its payment solutions for all geographies where we operate around the world, as well as the manufacturing of some POS terminals, printers, bar code scanners and various other kiosks.
Further information regarding the potential impact of these relationships on our business operations, and regarding sources and availability of raw materials, is also included in Item 1A of this Report under the caption “Reliance on Third Parties,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Product Backlog 
Our backlog was approximately $1.38 billion and $1.11 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped as well as certain professional and transaction services to be provided. Although we believe that the orders included in the backlog are firm, some orders may be canceled by the customer without penalty. Even when penalties for cancellation are provided for in a customer contract, we may elect to permit cancellation of orders without penalty where management believes it is in our best interests to do so. Further, we have a significant portion of revenue derived from our growing service-based business (including our cloud and hosted businesses), for which backlog information is not measured. Therefore, we do not believe that our backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of revenue for any future period. 
Employees 
On December 31, 2016, NCR had approximately 33,500 employees and contractors worldwide. 
Environmental Matters 
Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental regulations relating to the protection of the environment could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. While NCR does not currently expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with such laws and regulations, and while we believe the amounts provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities in this area, there can be no assurances that environmental matters will not lead to a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. A detailed discussion of the current estimated impacts of compliance issues relating to environmental regulations, particularly the Fox River and Kalamazoo River matters, is reported in Item 8 of Part II of this Report as part of Note 10, "Commitments and Contingencies" and Note 18, "Subsequent Events" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Further information regarding the potential impact of compliance with federal, state, and local environmental regulations is also included in Item 1A of this Report under the caption “Environmental,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
