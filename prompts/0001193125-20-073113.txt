Item 1. Business. 
Introduction 
 We are a smart home technology company. Our mission is to redefine the home experience through intelligently designed cloud-enabled solutions delivered to every home by people who care. Our brand name, Vivint, represents to live intelligently, and our solutions help our subscribers do just that. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2019 and prior to the Merger, we were a blank check company. We were originally incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted blank check company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Effective December 21, 2018, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware. Prior to the Merger, we neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. Until the Merger, based on our business activities, the Company was a shell company as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) because we had no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. 
 In August 2017, our SPAC sponsors purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 of our Founder Shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, with each SPAC sponsor purchasing an equal number of Founder Shares. In October 2017, our SPAC sponsors transferred an aggregate of 30,000 Founder Shares to one of our independent directors for their original purchase price. 
 On October 23, 2017, we completed our initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering) of 34,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the units), generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000. At the Initial Public Offering, each unit consisted of one of the Companys Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. 
 Concurrently with the completion of the Initial Public Offering, our SPAC sponsors purchased an aggregate of 5,933,334 warrants (the private placement warrants) at a price of $1.50 per warrant, or $8,900,001 in the aggregate, with each SPAC sponsor purchasing an equal number of warrants. The purchase price of the private placement warrants was added to the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and placed in a trust account (the trust account) such that the trust account held $345,000,000 at the time of closing of the Initial Public Offering. Each whole private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. 
 On December 5, 2017, we announced that, commencing December 8, 2017, holders of the 34,500,000 units sold in the Initial Public Offering could elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the units. Those units not separated continued to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the symbol MOSC.U and the Class A ordinary shares and warrants that were separated traded under the symbols MOSC and MOSC WS, respectively. 
 Upon our domestication in the State of Delaware on December 21, 2018, each of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares and Class F ordinary shares became, by operation of law, one share of Class A common stock or 
 
5 


  Class F common stock, respectively. Consequently, each holder of a unit, Class A ordinary share, Class F ordinary share or warrant immediately prior to the domestication now held a unit, share of Class A common stock, share of Class F common stock or warrant representing the same proportional equity interest in the Company as that shareholder held prior to the domestication and representing the same class of security. The Companys units, common stock and warrants were listed for trading on the NYSE under the symbols MOSC.U, MOSC and MOSC WS, respectively. 
 Recent Developments 
 On the Closing Date, we consummated the Merger. At the Effective Time, each stockholder of Legacy Vivint Smart Home received 84.5320916792 shares of our Common Stock for each share of Legacy Vivint Smart Home common stock. 
 Pursuant in each case to a Subscription Agreement entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement, Fortress and Blackstone completed the Fortress PIPE and the Blackstone PIPE, respectively. The Founder Shares automatically converted into Common Stock at Closing, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. The private placement warrants will expire five years after the Closing or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 On the Closing Date, pursuant to the Fortress Subscription and Backstop Agreement, Fortress purchased 2,698,753 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate of approximately $27.8 million. 
 In addition, pursuant to the Additional Forward Purchaser Subscription Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Forward Purchaser purchased from us 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share. As consideration for the additional investment, 25% of Mosaic Sponsor LLCs Founder Shares and private placement warrants were forfeited to us and we issued to the Forward Purchaser an equal number of shares of Common Stock and warrants concurrently with the Closing. 
 In connection with the Closing, we changed our name from Mosaic Acquisition Corp. to Vivint Smart Home, Inc. Our Common Stock is now listed on the NYSE under the symbol VVNT and warrants to purchase the Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share are listed on the NYSE under the symbol VVNT WS. 
 Business strategy after the merger 
 Creating a true smart home experience requires an end-to-end platform designed to drive broad consumer adoption. Our smart home platform is comprised of the following five pillars: (1) our Smart Home Operating System, (2) our AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software, Vivint Assist, (3) our portfolio of proprietary, internally developed smart devices, (4) our curated yet extensible partner-neutral ecosystem, and (5) our people delivering tech-enabled premium services, including consultative selling, professional installation, and support. 
 Our leading smart home platform currently has over 1.5 million subscribers and manages over 20 million in-home devices, with the Legacy Vivint Smart Home platform processing over 1.5 billion home activity events each day, as of December 31, 2019. Using our solution, subscribers are able to interact with all aspects of their home with their voice or any mobile device-anytime, anywhere. They can engage with people at their front door; view live and recorded video inside and outside their home; control thermostats, locks, lights, and garage doors; and proactively manage the comings and goings of family, friends, and strangers. Our subscribers engage with our smart home apps approximately seven times per day on average. 
 The smart home market is an expanding global opportunity and in the very early stages of broad consumer adoption. We believe the smart home market is experiencing rapid evolution, which can be divided into three phases. The first phase is represented by the proliferation of stand-alone smart devices. The second phase takes 
 
6 


  those devices and connects them to the home. The third and final phase, which we believe is the most pivotal phase in the markets evolution, takes smart home technology and applies it to create a continually learning, automated, seamlessly integrated smart home experience. 
 The connected home, the second phase, has a multitude of devices and an operating system to coordinate them all within a single unified system. But integrating numerous different devices from different manufacturers that were not designed to work together is difficult, and often results in an experience that is complex, inconsistent, and unreliable. Moreover, DIY solutions put a large burden on homeowners to accurately and correctly install and support so many devices themselves. And while whole-home automation is possible, it requires users to write individual rules for each and every circumstance. Mass adoption of the connected home by those other than technology enthusiasts has been limited. Our software within the devices, in the cloud, and in our app all work together to help mainstream consumers simply and easily manage their homes. 
 We believe that we are in a critical transition period from the second phase to the third phase where the key challenges related to the connected home offerings are overcome by a smart home experience, which we enable through our end-to-end smart home platform. 
 In this third phase, a smart home continuously learns and adapts to user behavior and preferences and delivers a more automated, personalized experience, powered by artificial intelligence technology. To achieve broad consumer adoption, we believe that smart home solutions must deliver a truly intelligent experience, not just a remote control of the home. Our cloud-enabled software solution understands the state of the home and its occupants, interacts with users to enable awareness and control, and takes coordinated action with minimal user effort. We believe that Vivint is best positioned to capitalize on the mass market opportunity of the smart home. 
 Our technology and people are the foundation of our business model. Our trained professionals educate consumers on the value and affordability of a smart home, customize a solution for their homes and needs, teach them how to use our platform and enhance their experience, and provide ongoing tech-enabled services to manage, monitor, and support their smart home. We have developed proprietary technology that enables our people to provide these consultative sales, installation, and support services to our subscribers more effectively and efficiently, delivering a powerful end-to-end smart home experience. 
 Legacy Vivint Smart Home has developed and launched over 10 proprietary devices since 2010, all designed to seamlessly integrate into a comprehensive smart home solution. These devices are the critical end points of the smart home experience, and our broad device portfolio enables our subscribers to achieve a comprehensive experience, across the entire home. The software inside these devices, in combination with our cloud-based software and mobile apps, comprises the Smart Home Operating System that knits these elements together to intuitively enable otherwise complex use cases that help address real-world problems. We also allow a select number of third-party stand-alone devices into our ecosystem if doing so enhances the smart home experience for our subscribers. These may be devices that have a large installed base or that have unique capabilities, such as voice assistants. In particular, we will often include competing stand-alone devices in our ecosystem to offer our subscribers with choices. Regardless, we ensure that all partner devices are seamlessly integrated into our Smart Home Operating System, and that we are able to manage and support them as well as our own proprietary devices. Our subscribers trust us to professionally install, monitor, and support our devices. As of December 31, 2019, on average each Legacy Vivint Smart Home subscriber had over 14 devices strategically placed in their home. Because our Smart Home Pros install the right devices in the right places in the home, we are able to collect superior data and generate unique insights, to improve the smart home experience for our users. We believe we are able to provide a much more complete picture of home activity than any of our competitors. 
 Our AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software, Vivint Assist, uses the data from our devices and partner devices to enable our subscribers to have a true smart home experience. We believe that we have the broadest, deepest, and purest home activity dataset, which we use to understand the state of the home in real 
 
7 


  time. This enables us to intelligently manage the residence on the homeowners behalf, while still keeping them informed and in full control. Moreover, our software learns from every interaction, enriching our platform and making the smart home experience smarter. We believe that no other company is as well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity to make the true smart home a reality. 
 The smart home requires an operating system that is always-on, reliable, able to process large streams of incoming data, and protected by enterprise-trade security. Our Smart Home Operating System does all of this, while delivering a seamless and intuitive end-user experience. In addition to dedicated in-home touchscreens and our comprehensive integrations with voice-control devices, we provide apps for Android and iOS mobile devices, as well as a web-based application for access from desktop and laptop computers. Leveraging software running in the home, in the cloud, and on users mobile devices, our operating system manages real-time communications across the system, executes rule-based actions and notifications, and provides a means for users to interact with their homes anywhere, anytime, and on any device. We deliver new functionality continually, deploying weekly updates to our software. We also push firmware updates to smart home devices throughout the year to deliver new functionality and improve device performance. We believe that continuously improving the smart home experience both increases the lifetime value of our current subscribers and attracts new subscribers. 
 Our Smart Home as a Service (SHaaS) business model generates subscription-based, high-margin recurring revenue from subscribers who sign up for our smart home services. We continue to focus on technology, service, and business model innovation to provide superior customer experience, from the time of first contact to the day-to-day experience. 
 In 2017, Legacy Vivint Smart Home made a strategic decision to offer Vivint Flex Pay to consumers as a part of its business model innovation, providing benefits to both our subscribers and our company. Vivint Flex Pay provides greater subscriber accessibility by enabling qualified customers to purchase smart home devices with unsecured financing either through a third party financing partner or through us, in most cases at zero-percent annual percentage rate (APR) for qualified customers. The launch of Vivint Flex Pay has enabled Legacy Vivint Smart Home to expand its market opportunity by reducing upfront cash required to acquire new subscribers. Vivint Flex Pay has also improved our unit economics, reduced our balance sheet risk, and improved the capital efficiency of our business. Today, Vivint Flex Pay is an important driver of our subscriber retention strategy. Vivint Flex Pay has also improved our subscriber economics. Legacy Vivint Smart Home had an Average Subscriber Lifetime of 92 months (approximately 8 years), as of December 31, 2019, based on its expected long-term annualized attrition rate of 13%. 
 Our go-to-market strategy is based on directly educating consumers about the value and benefits of a smart home experience. We reach consumers through a variety of highly efficient customer acquisition channels, including our direct-to-home, inside sales, and retail partnerships programs. We continue to scale these efforts through our proprietary operations technology, by launching new and innovative products and services, and by building out our consultative sales channels. Our nationwide sales and service footprint covers 98% of U.S. zip codes. We continue to strengthen our relationships with existing subscribers by offering them the ability to use Vivint Flex Pay to finance upgrades of their existing system and to add new devices and features to their smart homes as our portfolio of offerings expands. 
 As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Mosaic Acquisition Corp. had net income of $4.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Legacy Vivint Smart Home had over 1.5 million and 1.4 million subscribers, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 7%. In 2019 and 2018, Legacy Vivint Smart Home generated revenue of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively along with a net loss of $395.9 million and $472.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Legacy Vivint Smart Home had approximately $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion of total aggregate principal debt outstanding, respectively.

 Our Industry 
 The smart home market is large and growing rapidly. There were over 150 million households in the United States and Canada in 2019. With over 1.5 million subscribers as of December 31, 2019, Legacy Vivint Smart Homes penetration into the smart home market was only 1% of our current total estimated addressable market in the United States and Canada alone. Given the rapid pace of technological development in our industry, we believe it is likely that the total addressable market will continue to expand. The ability to address the cost issue, among other things, can potentially increase smart home penetration in the future. 
 To date the market has seen some early penetration from stand-alone devices with relatively narrow capabilities. These products have attracted early adopters and technology enthusiasts but have not adequately met the deeper need for a fully integrated smart home experience. These devices generally require do-it-yourself installation, do not integrate well with other devices, and have been designed with a single use case in mind. Generally, each device has its own mobile application, making installation and interoperability difficult for those consumers who do attempt to further their journey and install more devices in their home. As more and more devices have come to market, consumer demand for a central operating system that can better manage and integrate those devices has grown. 
 The connected home has a multitude of devices and requires an operating system to coordinate them all within a single unified system. But integrating many different devices from different manufacturers that were not designed to work together is difficult, and often results in an experience that is complex, inconsistent, and unreliable. Moreover, DIY solutions put a large burden on homeowners to install and support many devices themselves. And while whole-home automation is possible, it requires users to write individual rules for each and every circumstance. These DIY solutions also often require a high upfront cost, which can be prohibitively expensive for certain customers. For these reasons, mass adoption of the connected home by those other than technology enthusiasts has been limited. 
 As previously discussed, the next phase of the evolution of the connected home will be the smart home. Just as Apple and iOS enabled entirely new kinds of applications and use cases for the smart phone, we believe that our Smart Home Operating System will be the foundation for the full smart home experience and will enable many new business models that are based on streamlining various experiences in and around the home in innovative ways. 
 We believe there is a significant opportunity for companies to provide the end-to-end smart home experience. A successful smart home company must be able to provide the following: 
 

 | An end-to-end solution with a comprehensive integration of technology and people;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A cloud-enabled operating system that provides a seamless and intuitive smart home experience;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A portfolio of compelling use cases orchestrated across multiple devices and leveraging artificial intelligence for adaptive and personalized automation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A broad suite of smart devices designed to work as part of a comprehensive smart home;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | An extensible platform complete with deep partner integrations of popular stand-alone devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Local professional services to educate consumers and to install and support devices in every home; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A trusted relationship with consumers, who expect their sensitive home data to be kept private.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our fully integrated, end-to-end product, sales and service approach successfully addresses these key points of friction, and positions us to drive broad consumer market adoption.

 Our Smart Home Platform 
 We believe that our integrated, end-to-end approach successfully addresses the above requirements. 
 End-to-End Platform Built to Drive Broad Market Adoption 
 Our purpose-built platform has the components required to deliver on the promise of a true smart home experience. Our technology and people are the foundation of our solution. 
 Our technology seamlessly integrates in-home devices and cloud-enabled services to deliver an experience that addresses real-world problems. From answering the door remotely to automating the temperature settings in a home environment, our smart home technology meets customers needs for convenience and control. 
 We believe that our purpose-built end-to-end platform best positions Vivint to deliver on the promise of broad market smart home adoption. 
 Cloud-Enabled Smart Home Operating System 
 Our cloud-enabled Smart Home Operating System delivers a seamless, easy-to-use, and intuitive smart home experience. Leveraging software running in the home, in the cloud, and on customers mobile devices, our operating system securely manages real-time communications across the system, executes rules and notifications triggered by defined home-related events, and provides a means for users to interact with their homes from around the globe. In addition to dedicated in-home touchscreens and our comprehensive integrations with voice-control devices, we provide apps for Android and iOS mobile devices, as well as a web-based application for access from desktop and laptop computers. 
 Providing a seamless experience covering a multitude of separate devices is of critical importance in moving beyond individual devices to a more comprehensive solution that can help address real-world problems. For instance, when someone comes to the front door, the homeowner may want to let them into the house. This requires a doorbell camera, lighting, locks, the security system, and possibly a garage door controller and interior cameras to all work gracefully together. Our Smart Home Operating System does just this, enabling a multitude of use cases in a simple and intuitive fashion. Moreover, it helps ensure that all of the mundane tasks of device management - security, firmware upgrades, telemetry, diagnostics, and more - are taken care of, so that the system is as reliable as possible. 
 Legacy Vivint Smart Home began installing comprehensive connected home solutions in 2010, and these quickly became the choice of the majority of Legacy Vivint Smart Homes new subscribers and the clear focus of the company. We believe that our experience in this space - understanding consumers and the challenges of making a connected home into something seamless and reliable - sets us apart from our competitors. 
 Software-Enabled Smart Home Devices 
 Legacy Vivint Smart Home has developed and launched over 10 proprietary smart home devices since 2010. These devices are the end points of the smart home experience we offer. The software inside these devices, combined with our cloud-based software and mobile apps, enables our Smart Home Operating System to collect and combine end-point data into complex use cases that help consumers to address real-world problems. In particular, our devices are designed to work as part of a comprehensive system, with features and capabilities that only make sense in that context, and which are often not present on devices designed primarily for individual purchase and use. 
 Using the Smart Hub or the Vivint Smart Home App, our subscribers can connect to and communicate with their in-home devices, either from within the home or on-the-go. The Vivint Element Thermostat makes sure that 
 
10 


  the home environment is both comfortable and energy efficient, while the Vivint Smart Drive provides users with 24/7 DVR and personalized, local cloud storage. Our range of other devices, including cameras, door and window sensors, motion sensors, tilt sensors, glass break detectors, key fobs, medical pendants, carbon monoxide detectors, flood sensors, and lamp modules extend the smart home experience to every part of the home, connecting users to their environments in new ways. 
 Our subscribers trust us to professionally install, monitor, and currently support an average of over 14 devices strategically placed in each home. Because our Smart Home Pros install the right devices in the right places, we are able to collect superior data and generate insights, enabling us to provide a much more complete picture of home activity than any of our competitors and to improve the smart home experience for our users. 
 Our Curated Partner Ecosystem 
 We allow a limited number of stand-alone devices into our ecosystem if doing so enhances the smart home experience for our subscribers. These may be devices that have a large installed base or that have unique capabilities, such as voice assistants. Using the Google Home and Amazon Alexa integrations for example, subscribers can talk to their Smart Home Operating System, asking the system to play their favorite songs, while making sure that their garage doors are closed, and their locks are secured, along with other system functionality. In particular, we will often include competing stand-alone devices in our ecosystem to offer our subscribers choice. 
 Every device we support in our ecosystem is seamlessly integrated with both our Smart Home Operating System and our tech-enabled services. This curated, partner-neutral ecosystem is designed to provide our subscribers with a worry-free end-to-end experience from sale to installation through a lifetime of use and support. 
 Because our platform is the hub for an easy-to-use, end-to-end smart home experience, partners have sought us out and have enjoyed continued success through joint selling efforts. Through our ongoing partnership program, both Amazon and Google have been able to sell a large amount of connected smart home devices. We have found that enabling users to add their preferred devices only enhances their connected home experience. Additionally, adding more devices in each home enables our system to gather and learn from even more data points, leading to a better overall experience for users. Our partnerships with Google and Amazon are examples of the neutral approach we take in building our ecosystem. As both companies create competing voice-control platforms for a variety of tasks, we enable our subscribers to use either, or both, as part of their smart home. As the smart home market develops further, we believe that our platform will form the core of the home ecosystem, whereby businesses get new ways to streamline connections with customers in their living environments. In this regard, we will not only own the system powering the smart home, but we will also form strategic partnerships that will deepen the overall smart home experience. We expect these partnerships will help us protect and gain more market share. 
 AI-Driven Smart Home Automation and Assistance Software 
 We believe that our AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software, Vivint Assist, is a key differentiator that improves the customer experience and engagement by predicting and reacting to users needs, we believe which ultimately accelerates consumer adoption. 
 Our AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software, Vivint Assist, uses the data from our devices and our partner devices to enable our subscribers to have a true smart home experience. We have a relatively consistent set of devices installed across our subscribers homes and are focused on building high-performing models for Vivint Assist to understand the state of the home and to take or suggest action on the customers behalf. This in turn provides us with the opportunity to use feedback from our customers response to this interaction to further refine our models. 
 
11 


 We believe that we have the broadest, deepest, and purest home activity dataset, which we use to understand the state of the home in real time. That enables us to intelligently manage the residence on the homeowners behalf, while still keeping them informed and in full control. Vivint Assist processes home events such as interactions with lights, locks, thermostats, touchscreens, voice-control devices, and door and motion sensors; thermodynamic data such as interior and exterior temperature and heating/cooling duty cycles; location data from mobile devices; and users interactions with Vivint Assist itself. 
 Moreover, our software learns from every interaction, enriching our platform and making the smart home experience smarter. We believe that no other company is as well positioned as Vivint to capitalize on the opportunity to make the true smart home a reality. 
 Local Tech-Enabled Services to Educate, Manage and Support the Smart Home 
 Our trained professionals educate consumers on the value and affordability of a smart home, customize a solution for their homes and needs, teach them how to use our platform and enhance their experience, and provide ongoing tech-enabled services to manage, monitor, and support their smart home. We have developed proprietary technology that enables our people to provide these consultative sales, installation, and support services to our subscribers more effectively and efficiently, delivering a powerful end-to-end smart home experience. Our teams bring significant domain expertise when it comes to troubleshooting and fixing issues that may arise within a smart home across devices and platforms. Our direct relationship gives us a real-time view into their smart home needs, which provides us with a distinct competitive advantage that enhances our agility and responsiveness to consumer needs. Our end-to-end platform allows us to be our customers trusted support system. 
 Our People and Culture 
 We are the company that we are today because of the people that make up our team. We are proud of the culture we have built around innovation and subscriber centricity. Innovation also permeates our subscriber-centric approach. 
 When it comes to creating a smart home experience, we believe many individuals want and need the help of professional installation teams to set up the technology and to ensure that it is fully functional, which is why our installation teams are a vital part of Vivints service. Whether our tech-enabled Smart Home Pros connect with our customers on the phone or in-person, these individuals do their best to inform consumers on how Vivint can help customize their living environments to meet their unique smart home needs. In contrast to DIY programs, we provide a premium experience complete with ongoing tech-enabled service and support. 
 Many companies can make a sale, but few are able to provide a continuous, end-to-end experience over time. Providing the best possible smart home experience is what drives us as a company, and that is why we are focused on continually educating and supporting our subscribers-for the long-run. Providing a truly comprehensive and customizable smart home experience requires ongoing tech-enabled support, which we provide through our consultative sales, professional installation and customer support teams. These teams exist because we want to ensure that our subscribers are cared for over the duration of their time with Vivint, which for Legacy Vivint Smart Home was approximately 8 years, on average, as of December 31, 2019. 
High-Performing Scalable Economic Model 
 We believe our end-to-end solution, long-term customer relationships, and subscription-based, high-margin recurring revenues drive significant long-term value. 
 Our business is driven by the acquisition of new subscribers and by managing and retaining our existing subscriber base. The acquisition of new subscribers requires significant upfront investment, which in turn 
 
12 


  generates predictable, high-margin recurring revenue (with approximately 74% net service margins for Legacy Vivint Smart Home for the year ended December 31, 2019) from our cloud-enabled smart home solutions. This high-visibility, high-margin revenue comes from selling our solution and accompanying smart home devices to our subscribers. Therefore, we focus our investment decisions on acquiring new subscribers in the most cost-effective manner while striving to maximize existing subscriber retention and lifetime. 
 We drive long-term subscriber retention through our high-quality subscriber experience, from the time of first contact to day-to-day use. For example, our subscribers engage with our smart home apps on average seven times per day. To provide even greater subscriber accessibility and affordability to the platform and improve our cash flow economics, Legacy Vivint Smart Home launched Vivint Flex Pay in 2017. Vivint Flex Pay enables qualified subscribers to purchase smart home devices with unsecured financing either through a third-party financing partner or through us, in most cases at zero percent APR. 
 We have made it a primary focus to retain our existing subscribers. Our retention improves as our subscribers enter into longer term contracts. Although there are costs to acquiring new subscribers, because we operate on a recurring revenue-based model, acquiring subscribers results in cumulative value generation that compounds and accrues over time. 
 We will continue investing in innovative technologies that we believe will make our platform more valuable and engaging for subscribers, and we intend to continue investing in new subscriber acquisition channels to further improve the economics of our business model. We will also continue working to improve the lifetime value of our customers and the unit economics of our business by continually enhancing the smart home experience. 
 Our Customers 
 Legacy Vivint Smart Home had over 1.5 million subscribers in North America as of December 31, 2019. Our business is not dependent on any single subscriber or a few subscribers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the respective market or on us as a whole. No individual subscriber accounted for more than 1% of Legacy Vivint Smart Homes consolidated 2019 revenue. 
Privacy and Security 
 Our subscribers use our products and services to provide them with peace of mind for the things that matter most to them-their families and homes. This requires our devices to be professionally installed and deployed throughout their homes, and requires our solutions to collect and manage information about our subscribers home activity. Much of the information that our technology manages on our subscribers behalf, including sensor data, video, and the insights gleaned by our AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software, Vivint Assist, is sensitive and private, and we take our responsibility to protect this information seriously. Most importantly, we use this data and the insights we generate from it to improve the smart home experience. Our subscribers trust us to help them manage their homes, which we consider a unique relationship that we strive to strengthen. 
Subscriber Contracts 
 We seek to ensure that our subscribers understand our smart home experience, along with the key terms of their contracts by conducting two surveys with every subscriber. The first survey is conducted live via a digital interface prior to the execution of the contract and professional installation, and the second survey is conducted after the installation is completed. Each survey is recorded and stored in our subscriber relationship management and billing system software, or CRM software, enabling easy access and review.

 Types of Contracts 
 When signing up for our services, subscribers currently have three options to pay for their products and associated installation: payment-in-full, or consumer financing either through our CFP provided to qualified U.S. subscribers in partnership with our third-party financing providers, or under RICs. For those who choose to pay in full at the time of signing, we receive cash (paid by the customer through various means, including check, automated clearing house debit, or credit or debit card) for the full amount of the purchase of products and related installation. We also receive recurring revenue for Services on a month-to-month basis from these subscribers. In 2019, 69% of new subscribers opted to sign up under the CFP. When a subscriber signs up under this program, we receive cash from the third-party financing provider for the subscribers purchase of products and the related installation costs. For certain third-party provider loans, we pay a monthly fee based on either the average daily outstanding balance of the loans or the number of outstanding loans, depending on the third-party financing provider. Additionally, we share in liabilities for credit losses depending on the credit quality of the customer. For other third-party loans, we receive net proceeds (net of fees and expected losses) for which we have no further obligation to the third-party. We believe that the CFP helps to make the smart home experience more affordable and approachable for qualified customers, and it also helps to preserve the health of our balance sheet. Our last financing option is a RIC, which is available to U.S. subscribers who do not qualify for the CFP based on their credit profile, and all Canadian subscribers. When a customer signs up for a RIC, we record a note receivable from the customer for the purchase of products and related installation, minus risk-adjusted imputed interest, and this revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract. We are planning to add additional financing partners in order to maximize the number of subscribers who are able to obtain financing through third-party partners and to move this risk off our balance sheet. 
Term and Termination 
 Historically, Legacy Vivint Smart Home has generally offered contracts to subscribers that range in length from 36 to 60 months, subject to automatic monthly renewal after the expiration of the initial term. Since the beginning of 2013, a majority of these new subscribers have entered into 60-month contracts. As a result, the average initial contract length for Legacy Vivint Smart Home subscribers has increased over time, reaching an average of 51 months as of December 31, 2019. Subscribers have a right of rescission period prescribed by applicable law during which such subscriber may cancel the contract without penalty or obligation. Generally, these rescission periods range from 3 to 15 days, depending on the jurisdiction in which a subscriber resides. As a company policy we provide new subscribers 70 years of age and older a 30-day right of rescission. If the subscriber rescinds during the applicable rescission period under the terms of the contract, the subscriber is required to return the applicable equipment. Once the applicable rescission period expires, the subscriber is responsible for the monthly services fees under the contract. 
Other Terms 
 We provide our subscribers with maintenance free of charge for the first 120 days. After 120 days, we will repair or replace defective smart home devices without charge, but we typically bill the subscriber a charge for each service visit. If a utility or governmental agency requires a change to our platform or tech-enabled service after installation of the system, the subscriber may be charged for the equipment and labor associated with the required change. We also charge certain subscribers a monthly fee related to the cost of maintaining our cellular communication network. 
 We do not provide insurance or warrant that the system will prevent a burglary, fire, hold-up or any such other event. Our contracts limit our liability to a maximum of $2,000 per event and, where permissible, provide a one-year statute of limitations to file an action against us. We may cease or suspend tech-enabled monitoring and repair service due to, among other things, work stoppages, weather, phone service interruption, government requirements, subscriber bankruptcy or non-payment by subscribers after we have given notice that their service is being canceled due to such non-payment.

 Sales and Marketing 
 We acquire subscribers primarily through our DTH and NIS channels. We are currently testing out multiple retail partnerships to determine the optimal format for this channel. Regardless of channel, our tech-enabled sales professionals always take a consultative approach to the sales process, educate potential subscribers on the benefits of smart home technology, and tailor a solution that serves each subscribers needs. This consultative sales process has enabled us to achieve a high adoption rate of our smart home solutions. We are continually evaluating ways to improve subscriber acquisition efficiency across all of our sales channels. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Legacy Vivint Smart Home acquired over 300,000 new subscribers. Of these new subscribers, 57% joined through Legacy Vivint Smart Homes DTH, and 43% were brought on through NIS. 
Marketing Strategy 
 We leverage the Vivint brand across all our channels. We invest in certain marketing strategies which amplify the brand and awareness of our solutions, including through general paid media outlets. Vivint also has exclusive brand naming rights for the Vivint Smart Home Arena, home of the NBAs Utah Jazz. 
Direct to Home Sales 
 Our direct to home tech-enabled sales team is comprised of up to 4,500 representatives at our peak selling season working across select markets throughout North America. DTH representatives visit consumers in their homes, providing interested individuals with an in-depth description of our offerings. They benefit from our recruiting and training programs designed to promote sales productivity. Markets are selected each year based on a number of factors, including demographics, population density and our past experience selling in these markets. Because expenses associated with our direct to home sales channels are directly correlated with new subscriber acquisition, the majority of the costs associated with this channel are variable and can scale with customer acquisition. We also have a program whereby a number of direct-to-home sales representatives reside in certain select markets and sell in those markets on a year round basis. We expect the number of new subscriber contracts generated through this program to continue to increase over time. 
National Inside Sales 
 Our NIS channel provides a consultative experience for consumers who contact us. Driven by increasing brand awareness and marketing effectiveness, the number of new subscribers acquired by Legacy Vivint Smart Home through this channel in 2019 increased 3% compared to 2018. 
 The NIS team utilizes leads generated through multiple sources, both digital and traditional, including paid, organic and local search and display advertising. We believe that we will continue to experience growth in this channel as Vivints brand awareness improves and customers understanding of the smart home increases. Customers originated through the Legacy Vivint Smart Home NIS channel has grown as a percentage of our total originations from approximately 10% in 2009 to approximately 43% for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
 Retail 
 We are currently running multiple retail partnerships pilot programs, with the goal of adding an additional subscriber acquisition channel that will allow us to offer a consultative sales experience while preserving our unit economics. Our retail partnership pilots are built primarily on a variable-cost model. Through these pilots, we hope to reach additional consumers that have not yet considered purchasing Products and Services, those that have already purchased other smart home products that have not met their expectations, and those that want to experience and buy smart home solutions in a traditional retail setting. Given the success of our existing DTH and NIS efforts, our retail pilots are built to provide interested subscribers with a strong understanding of the technology and service components of our smart home experience, in a retail setting, on a scalable, variable-cost basis.

 Operations 
 Our end-to-end solution includes a dedication to providing a smart home experience, complete with tech-enabled service and support. We have structured our organization and our operations in a way that allows us to maximize efficiency and prioritize the subscriber experience, which is why we have built a successful brand and generated high subscriber satisfaction ratings over time. 
 In-Home Service 
 We deploy full-time in-home tech-enabled service professionals (Smart Home Pros) throughout North America to provide prompt tech-enabled service to our subscribers, on an as-needed basis. Our in-home service professionals are highly trained to address maintenance and service issues. Using our proprietary, in-house sales and service technologies - TechGenie - they are able to schedule service and installation appointments in real-time, thus maximizing subscriber satisfaction and minimizing friction in the subscriber relationship. This dimension of our offering personalized in-home support is key to our end-to-end solution, and we believe that providing personalized smart home service will be an integral part of meeting the needs of the broader consumer market. 
 Customer Service and Monitoring 
 Our tech-enabled customer service centers operate around the clock, year-round, without exception. All employees who work in customer service undergo training on billing and service-related questions. Customer service representatives are required to pass background checks and, depending upon their job function, may require licensing. 
 Our two central monitoring facilities are located in Utah and Minnesota and are fully able to be primary backups for each other and operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year-round-including on holidays. All professionals who work in our monitoring facilities undergo comprehensive training and are required to pass background checks and, in certain cases, licensing tests or other checks to obtain the required licensing. 
 Billing and Collections 
 Our billing and collections representatives are located in our Utah offices. We cross-train these representatives to also handle general customer service inquiries with the goal of improving the customer experience and to increase personnel flexibility. Billing and collections representatives are also required to pass background checks and, depending upon their job function, may also require licensing by the state of Utah. A majority of our subscribers pay electronically either via ACH, credit or debit card. A subscriber who pays electronically is generally placed on a billing cycle based on their contract origination date and, in certain instances, the subscriber may choose their billing date. Our subscribers billed via direct invoice can be billed on any day of the month, with payment due 15 days subsequent to the invoice date. Subscribers are billed in advance for their monthly services based on their billing cycle and not calendar month. In those jurisdictions where we are entitled to do so by law, we charge late fees to subscribers whose accounts are more than 10 days past due. 
Key Systems 
 We utilize an integrated subscriber relationship management and billing system software, based on a well-established enterprise-scale cloud solution (CRM software). This CRM software allows us to scale our business, providing the flexibility to accommodate the multiple customer support and billing models resulting from the continued expansion in our product and service offerings over time. The CRM software enables one-call resolution and allows for operational efficiency by not requiring the entry of data multiple times, thus improving data accuracy. Additionally, the data is replicated to both a reporting and a business intelligence server to reduce processing time, as well as to an offsite server used for disaster recovery purposes. 
 
16 


 We also utilize an enterprise resource planning software (ERP), primarily to manage financial accounting, inventory and supply chain functions of our business. Similar to the CRM software, the ERP allows us to scale our operations to accommodate the continued expansion of our business models and product and service offerings. The ERP also provides improved security and automated system controls. 
 Suppliers 
 We provide our services through a panel installed in our subscribers homes. Since early 2014, nearly all new subscribers, including those contracted through Legacy Vivint Smart Home, are using the Vivint SkyControl panel. From 2010 through 2014, 2GIG Go!Control was Legacy Vivint Smart Homes primary panel. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 88% of Legacy Vivint Smart Homes subscriber base use SkyControl panels and 12% use 2GIG Go!Control panels. 
 In 2013, Legacy Vivint Smart Home completed the sale of 2GIG Technologies, Inc., or 2GIG. In connection with the 2GIG sale, 2GIG assigned to Legacy Vivint Smart Home their intellectual property rights in the SkyControl Panel and certain peripheral equipment. This proprietary equipment is a critical component of our current smart home and security offerings, and we expect it to remain a critical component of our future offerings as well. In addition, at the time of the 2GIG sale Legacy Vivint Smart Home entered into a five-year supply agreement with 2GIG, pursuant to which they would be the exclusive provider of Legacy Vivint Smart Homes control panel requirements and certain peripheral equipment, subject to certain exceptions, during the term. This agreement was completed in April 2018. 
 We license certain communications infrastructure, software and services from Alarm.com to support subscribers with the Go!Control panel. These Go!Control panels are connected to Alarm.coms hosted platform. Alarm.com also provides an interface to enable these subscribers to access their systems remotely. We also license certain intellectual property from Alarm.com for our subscribers using the SkyControl panel. 
 Generally, our hardware device suppliers maintain a stock of devices and key components to cover any minor supply chain disruptions. Where possible we also utilize dual sourcing methods to minimize the risk of a disruption from a single supplier. However, we also rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers for critical components of our solution. Replacing any sole source or limited source suppliers could require the expenditure of significant resources and time to redesign and resource these products. 
 Research and Development 
 Our innovation center headquartered in Lehi, Utah and our research and development office in Boston, Massachusetts, focus on the research and development of new Products and Services, both within and beyond our existing offerings. Our professionals are trained in our proprietary innovation management process, from subscriber needs assessment to Product and Service launch. Our innovation center includes people with expertise in all aspects of the development process, including hardware development, software development, design, and quality assurance. 
 By focusing on innovation, and continually enhancing our Product and Service offerings, we believe we can increase new subscriber originations, subscriber usage and subscriber satisfaction, thereby potentially increasing revenue per subscriber and lowering subscriber attrition. 
 We expect to continue introducing new, innovative devices and software features. We design these new Products and, where appropriate, leverage partnerships for their manufacture. 
 By vertically integrating the development and design of our Products and Services with our existing sales and customer service activities, we believe we are able to more quickly respond to market needs, and better understand our subscribers interactions and engagement with our Products and Services. This provides critical data enabling us to improve the power, usability and intelligence of these Products and Services.

 Intellectual Property 
 Patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights are important to our business and we continuously refine our intellectual property strategy to maintain and improve our competitive position. We seek to protect new intellectual property to safeguard our ongoing technological innovations and strengthen our brand, and we believe we take appropriate action against infringements or misappropriations of our intellectual property rights by others. We review third-party intellectual property rights to help avoid infringement, and to identify strategic opportunities. We typically enter into confidentiality agreements to further protect our intellectual property. 
 Our portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents consist of over 150 issued patents and over 400 pending patent applications that relate to a variety of smart home, security and other technologies utilized in our business. We also own a portfolio of trademarks, including domestic and foreign registrations for Vivint, and are a licensee of various patents, from our third-party suppliers and technology partners. 
 Because of the importance that subscribers place on reputation and trust when making a decision on a smart home provider, our brand is critical to our business. Patents related to individual products or technologies extend for varying periods dependent on the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term for patents in the various countries where we have sought patent protection. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks. 
 Competition 
 The smart home industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our major competitors range from large-cap technology companies, which predominantly offer DIY devices to expand their core market opportunity, to companies that are focused on singular smart home experiences (e.g., security focused), to industrial and telecommunications companies that are offering connected home experiences. Historically, the vast majority of companies have not offered comprehensive smart home solutions that meet the growing requirements of households. In many cases, companies have launched DIY or standalone devices to enhance their existing offerings, leading to partial or incomplete smart home experiences. Certain features of our platform compete with companies that fall into the following categories: 

 | Large technology companies: Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | Security-based offerings: ADT, Alarm.com, Brinks Home Security, FrontPoint, Johnson Controls International plc., SimpliSafe, and STANLEY Convergent Security Solutions
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Industrial and smart hardware companies: Arlo, Control4, Honeywell, Resideo and Samsung
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Telecommunications Companies: Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, Rogers Communications, and Time Warner Cable
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we compete effectively with each of our competitors listed above. However, we expect competition to intensify in the future. We face increasing competition from competitors that are building their own smart home platforms, such as Amazon, Apple and Google, as well as from companies that offer single-point connected devices. With Legacy Vivint Smart Home having installed more than 2.5 million smart home and security systems , we believe we are well positioned to compete with them because we benefit from more than 20 years of experience; our efficient direct-to-home and inside sales channels; integrated smart home platform; innovative products; and our award-winning customer service. 
 In addition, several of our competitors have greater name recognition, much longer operating histories, more and better-established subscriber relationships, larger sales forces, larger marketing and software development budgets, and significantly greater resources than we do. Therefore, it is possible that we may not compete favorably with respect to certain of the foregoing factors. 
 
18 


 We also compete with numerous smaller regional and local providers. We also face, or may in the future face, competition from other providers of information and communication products and services, a number of which have significantly greater capital and other resources than we do. 
 Companies in our industry compete primarily on the basis of price in relation to the quality of the devices and tech-enabled services they provide. The companys brand and reputation, market visibility, service and product capabilities, quality, price, efficient direct-to-home sales channel, and the ability to identify and sell to prospective subscribers, are all factors that contribute to competitive success in the smart home industry. We emphasize the quality of the service we provide, rather than focusing primarily on price competition. We believe we compete effectively against other national, regional and local companies offering smart home and security alarm monitoring services by offering our subscribers an integrated smart home, along with an attractive value proposition, and our proven, award-winning customer service. 
 Government Regulations 
 United States 
 We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities. 
 We are also required to obtain various licenses and permits from state and local authorities in connection with the operation of our businesses. The majority of states regulate in some manner the sale, installation, servicing, monitoring or maintenance of smart home and electronic security systems. In the states that do regulate such activity, our company and our employees are typically required to obtain and maintain licenses, certifications or similar permits from the state as a condition to engaging in the smart home and security services business. 
 In addition, a number of local governmental authorities have adopted ordinances regulating the activities of security service companies, typically in an effort to reduce the number of false alarms in their jurisdictions. These ordinances attempt to reduce false alarms by, among other things, requiring permits for individual electronic security systems, imposing fines (on either the subscriber or the company) for false alarms, discontinuing police response to notification of an alarm activation after a subscriber has had a certain number of false alarms, and requiring various types of verification prior to dispatching authorities. 
 Our sales and marketing practices are regulated by the federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations typically place restrictions on the manner in which products and services can be advertised and sold, and to provide residential purchasers with certain rescission rights. In certain circumstances, consumer protection laws also require the disclosure of certain information in the contract with our subscriber and, in addition, may prohibit the inclusion of certain terms or conditions of sale in such contracts. Many local governments regulate direct-to-home sales activities and contract terms and require that salespeople and the company on whose behalf the salesperson is selling obtain licenses to carry on business in that municipality. 
 In addition, the CFP and RICs are subject to federal and state laws. These laws primarily require that consumer financing contracts include or be accompanied by certain prescribed disclosures, but these laws also may place limitations on particular fees and charges, and require licensing or registration of the party extending consumer credit. Citizens and any other financing partners providing third-party consumer financing under Vivint Flex Pay are responsible for compliance with such laws applicable to Vivint Flex Pay, and we are responsible for compliance with such federal and state laws regulating RICs. 
 Canada 
 Companies operating in the smart home and electronic security service industry in Canada are subject to provincial regulation of their business activities, including the regulation of direct-to-home sales activities and 
 
19 


  contract terms and the sale, installation and maintenance of smart home and electronic security systems. Most provinces in Canada regulate direct-to-home sales activities and contract terms and require that salespeople and the company on whose behalf the salesperson is selling obtain licenses to carry on business in that province. Consumer protection laws in Canada also require that certain terms and conditions be included in the contract between the service provider and the subscriber. 
 A number of Canadian municipalities require subscribers to obtain licenses to use electronic security alarms within their jurisdiction. Municipalities also commonly require entities engaged in direct-to-home sales within their municipality to obtain business licenses. 
 Seasonality 
 Our DTH sales are seasonal in nature with a substantial majority of our new customer originations occurring during a sales season from April through August. We make investments in the recruitment of our DTH sales force and the inventory prior to each sales season. We experience increases in net subscriber acquisition costs during these time periods. 
 The management of our sales channels has historically resulted in a consistent sales pattern that enables us to more accurately forecast customer originations. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2019, Legacy Vivint Smart Home had approximately 5,750 full-time employees, excluding its seasonal direct to home installation technicians, sales representatives and certain other support professionals. As of December 31, 2019, a very small minority of Legacy Vivint Smart Homes employees were represented by a labor union. We believe that we generally have good relationships with our employees. The majority of our full-time employees are located in cities within Utah, with additional locations in Boston, Massachusetts Las Vegas, Nevada; Tampa Florida; and South Eagan, Minnesota. Employees located outside of these areas are comprised primarily of our full-time Smart Home Pros, who service our customers and are located in all states in the United States (except New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont), as well as the majority of Canadian provinces.
