Our Market Opportunities 
 Technology revolution and environmental impact is driving a swift pace of change, resulting in ongoing societal transformation, complicated geopolitical dynamics, a shifting threat landscape and the globalization of commerce. To address this evolving landscape, our customers are actively seeking technology-enabled solutions at the speed of relevancy to upgrade and transform assets and operations. The below trends are key drivers of activity and growth in both our Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure segments.
 Defense Spending Remains a Key Focus of the national agenda due to the reemergence of long-term strategic peer competition, which has been cited in the National Defense Strategy as the primary concern for U.S. national prosperity and security. This reemergence has resulted in increased global disorder and a security environment, defined by rapid technological change, which may be more complex than ever before. We believe the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community will continue to invest in space, C5ISR, and missile defense. 
 Cybersecurity is Mission Critical to U.S. National Security and cybersecurity threats are increasing in volume and sophistication as global connectivity and the rise of social media have led to an explosion in the amount of available and exploitable data. The recent SolarWinds hacking incident is a noteworthy example.  The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that threats from hacks, cyber criminals, foreign governments, malicious insiders and corporate espionage have a $600 billion annual global cost impact. The proliferation of mobile devices, smart devices and cloud computing has vastly increased the need for enterprise-wide risk-based cybersecurity programs and governments have become increasingly aware of the need for a proactive approach to the risk of cyber-attacks. We believe that this market will continue to grow in response to the shifting threat landscape and recent high-profile attacks, including SolarWinds. 
 Consistent Need for Actionable Intelligence to Support U.S. Priorities is driving a shifting threat landscape that necessitates a greater need for collaboration and cooperation between intelligence agencies. There is a new demand for joint all-domain command and control systems that are optimized to function cohesively across a spectrum of domains. This in turn drives a need for sophisticated data analytics to aggregate data into useful formats in real-time. To respond, we believe the United States intelligence community and Department of Defense will need continued focus on information sharing and collaboration for improved intelligence accuracy and timeliness encompassing multiple forms of intelligence collection. 
 Global Infrastructure Needs Significant Replacements and Technology-Driven Upgrades. Aging physical infrastructure is strained by the swift pace of technological change combined with heightened new expectations for sustainability and environmental impact.  Furthermore, failure to maintain the infrastructure makes it more difficult to recover from unexpected disasters caused by climate change.  The United States infrastructure needs exceed $2 trillion according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, for roads, highways, bridges, water/wastewater and other infrastructure needs.  Critical infrastructure, specifically transportation infrastructure that is essential to national economic and security concerns including airports, bridges, and rail and transit systems, is particularly vulnerable. We believe aging infrastructure and a focus on environmental impact will continue to be replaced and supplanted by newer, smarter and more sustainable infrastructure with an increased focus on connectivity. 
 Urbanization Creates Demand for Smart Cities with Connected Populations. Cities around the globe increasingly demand new more sustainable capabilities, such as sensor networks and 
 6


communication strategies to connect streetlights, security cameras and emergency systems, to provide important real-time information and better serve their citizens and reduce carbon emissions. Integrated corridor management solutions, intelligent transportation systems, advanced rail systems and updated telecommunication networks will keep cities around the world functioning as smart and sustainable cities and serve as engines for economic growth. 
 Transformation of Legacy Service Delivery Models through Technology. Historical capital project management is changing with the introduction of cloud-connected computer-aided design, automation, big data, machine learning and other technologies. The introduction of these new technologies allows industry participants to reimagine existing value chains, address integrated lifecycle objectives, assure human rights are observed in their supply chains, provide environmentally sensitive and sustainable solutions, boost productivity and streamline project management. Industry participants that have the capability to embrace these new technologies to enhance their capability and service offering to higher value solutions will be well positioned to assist governments and communities in their transformation. 
 Change equals opportunity, and Parsons is well-positioned to serve a large array of governments and companies. Across a diverse set of industries, we provide smart and agile solutions that address our customers’ concerns as they adapt to the rapid changes of a more interconnected and technology-driven world.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our objective is to continue to transform our business into an integrated, full life cycle systems integrator that delivers scalable solutions and drives revenue growth, expanded margins, and strong cash flows.
 Backlog 
 We view growth in total backlog as a key measure of our business growth. We define backlog to include the following two components: 
  
• | Funded—Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unfunded—Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Backlog includes (i) unissued task orders and unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. 
 Our backlog includes orders under contracts that can extend for several years, and in some cases, contracts that extend for more than 10 to 15 years. For example, the U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds for our U.S. federal government customers on a yearly basis, even though their contracts with us may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years to complete. As a result, our federal contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term.  All or some 
 11


of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the U.S. Congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract.
 As of December 31, 2020, our total backlog was $8.1 billion, consisting of $4.0 billion of funded backlog and $4.1 billion of unfunded backlog. We expect to recognize $2.8 billion of our funded backlog at December 31, 2020 as revenues in the following twelve months. However, our government customers may cancel their contracts with us at any time through a termination for convenience or may elect to not exercise option periods under such contracts. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would not receive anticipated future revenues, but would generally be permitted to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. 
 Competition 
 The industries we operate in consist of a large number of enterprises ranging from small, niche-oriented companies to multi-billion-dollar corporations that serve many government and commercial customers. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise, technological innovation, our ability to deliver cost-effective multi-faceted services in a timely manner, our reputation and relationships with our customers, qualified and/or security-clearance personnel, and pricing. Our main competitors in Federal Solutions are U.S. federal systems integrators and service providers such as Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI International Inc, Leidos Holdings, Inc., Man Tech International Corporation, Science Applications International Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Perspecta, and The Raytheon Company. Our main competitors in Critical Infrastructure include AECOM Technology Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Stantec, Tetra Tech, Inc., and WSP, as well as Kapsch and Opus in the Connected Communities market. Large defense firms or technology companies may develop products or services in the future that could compete with us. 
Seasonality 
 Our results may be affected by variances as a result of weather conditions and contract award seasonality impacts that we experience across our businesses. The latter issue is typically driven by the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end, September 30. While not certain, it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award task orders or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the U.S. federal government fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended U.S. federal government fiscal year funds. In addition, we have also historically experienced higher bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the U.S. federal government fiscal year-end as we pursue new contract opportunities expected to be awarded early in the following U.S. federal government fiscal year as a result of funding appropriated for that U.S. federal government fiscal year. Furthermore, many U.S. state governments with fiscal years ending on June 30 tend to accelerate spending during their first quarter, when new funding becomes available. We may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods, and our results of operations may be affected by it. 
Human Capital Management
 We are committed to enhancing our position as a leading employer in our industry. Our culture and reputation as a leading provider of technology-driven solutions in the defense, intelligence and critical infrastructure markets enables us to recruit and retain some of the best available talent across the globe.  We believe that we are stronger and smarter when we work together and celebrate our diverse backgrounds.  We believe in doing right by the communities we serve, and we have policies prohibiting child labor and human trafficking.  We believe that Parsons is the place for our diverse employees to make a difference.  With over 15,500 employees, we experienced a 1.1% decrease in voluntary turnover in 2020 while converting nearly 90% of our workforce to a virtual environment during the current global COVID-19 pandemic.  This improvement was largely attributed to targeted retention strategies, including a comprehensive employee development and technical career track framework and the prioritization of an ideal culture to support the transformational strategy.  A high-level engagement among employees is reflected in our 2020 culture and engagement scores, which had an increased participation level of over 20%, and reflected significant improvements gained in survey areas such as alignment with strategic 
 12


direction, employee connection to Parsons’ success, promotion of culture of speed and agility, rewards for coming up with new ideas, and collaboration across organization boundaries to achieve company goals.
 Our principal asset is our team of diverse employees.  A large percentage of our employees have technical and professional backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees, with our employees holding more than 20,000 degrees and professional credentials, including registrations and certifications in technical areas such as Agile Methodology, Project Management, Engineering, Architecture, Green Building/Sustainability, Technology, and Security as of December 31, 2020.  Approximately 22% of our employees, including 58% of the employees in our Federal Solutions business segment, hold security clearances as of that date.  Of those holding such clearances in Federal Solutions, approximately 58% are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information Level clearances, which often require the completion of a polygraph.
 In 2020, we focused on retaining and developing our employees on highly sought-after key programs as part of the knitting of our success.   Such programs include the mentoring program, Parsons Distinguished Recognition and Incentive Program (DRIVE), and the Parsons’ Fellows Program.
 Mentoring: The Parsons mentoring program allows employees to cultivate skills, seek guidance and share professional experiences.  The program launched in 2020 is designed to:
  
• | Increase a sense of connection, engagement and retention of key diverse talent.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustain promotion and retention rates of diverse leadership talent.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand networks and enhance career development opportunities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 Recognition:  Understanding recognition at all levels is key to management and retention.  We expanded Parsons Distinguished Recognition and Incentive (DRIVE) Program that celebrates employees who go above and beyond their work.  Launched in 2019, with seven different award levels, the program is designed to reward employees who have made exceptional contributions to a program or project, or who have provided outstanding support to their teams, our clients, or our company as a whole.  Over 1,500 awards were issued to employees in 2020 and the program is growing.  
 Development: The Parsons’ Fellows Program recognizes our top technical experts and promotes innovation in solving our customers’ most difficult technical challenges.  It is a collaborative network of over forty selected motivated and passionate subject matter experts working to solve technical challenges through either strategic research and development or through the development of long-term technical policies and best practices.  The program defines its success through engagement, mentorship, and retention.  Every benefit that collaboration among the Fellows offers is expressed by the idea that the individual is brilliant, but a group of brilliant individuals acting as one can be more powerful and enable Parsons to accomplish even more in our quest to deliver a better world.
Inclusion Inspires Innovation
 Embracing inclusion, diversity and equality in all aspects of our business is fundamental to our corporate culture and vital to our continued growth and success.  Our employees work across 25 countries and collectively speak over 80 languages.  Diversity is one of our core values, and we pursue it in our workforce, our markets, our suppliers, and our services because we recognize that optimum solutions require different backgrounds, new perspectives, and open minds.  We leverage diversity and equality through the inclusion of employees, empowering them to shape the future of the corporation through collaboration and innovation.
 In 2017, we launched our Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) Task Force with executive sponsorship from the Board, our CEO, our President and COO, and our Chief People Officer.  The task force’s objectives are to attract, include, and retain talent, and to help achieve those goals.  Its 42 diverse members serve as ambassadors throughout the corporation, demonstrate leadership, and infuse their passion for 
 13


inclusion and diversity into our corporate culture.  Within the task force, subcommittees support the development and implementation of initiatives identified by the Board and the Executive Leadership Team that continue to advance our inclusion and diversity objectives.
 Subcommittees and Purpose
  
• | Metrics – Measure the success of inclusion and diversity
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Ambassadors – Bring inclusion and diversity to the local level to create inclusion and diversity awareness
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mentoring/Training – Drive improved awareness and engagement
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------

 With recent social justice and equality awakening, we launched the Listen-Learn-Action campaign.  Our Board and our CEO and Chairman implemented a thoughtful strategy to better understand the perspectives of our employees by listening to them through various forums, then sharing the understanding and offering educational resources to all employees, and, finally, putting into effect a concise, iterative quarterly action plan that holds us accountable to doing more to increasing the representation or historically underrepresented groups within our global workforce, and we are committed to taking action and ensuring Parsons is, and remains, an employer of choice.
 Employee Stock Ownership Plan
 At December 31, 2020, approximately 6,300 of our employees participated in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which owns approximately 39% of our outstanding shares.  In December 2020, the board of directors approved an amendment to the ESOP to provide greater diversification rights to participants.  The amendment provides that, with respect to all diversifications elected or processed after January 1, 2021, the definition of a qualified participant shall mean a participant who has attained the age of 50 and who has completed at least three years of participation in the ESOP and other criteria.  Each qualified participant shall generally be permitted to direct the ESOP as to the diversification of 50% of the value of the eligible vested portion of the participant’s ESOP account.  Further, in January 2021, the Parsons Corporation Board of Directors approved an amendment to the ESOP whereby distributions to participants in the Plan were modified as follows: (1) the threshold amount of an ESOP participant’s balance to be eligible for a single lump sum distribution was increased from $20,000 or less to $500,000 or less; (2) the threshold balance for a participant to be eligible to receive payment in two annual installments was increased from $40,000 or less to $750,000 or less; and (3) the threshold balance for a participant to be eligible to receive payment in three annual installments was increased to greater than $750,000.  This change was made to facilitate greater flexibility for certain eligible participants to receive their balances in fewer installments and to accelerate the increase in publicly traded float for the Company’s common stock.
Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property portfolio consists of issued and pending patents as well as trademarks for many of our technologies. In addition, we maintain a number of trade secrets that we endeavor to protect to ensure their continuing availability to us. Our technical expertise is vital to our growth strategy, and we believe they are a core competitive advantage.  We have 26 registered patents and 31 pending patents in the United States and 4 pending patents internationally.  We have 67 trademarks and 26 pending 
 14


trademark applications in the United States, and 145 trademarks and 34 pending trademark applications internationally.  We also currently offer 25 products for sale to our global customers.
 We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We also enter into proprietary information and intellectual property agreements with employees, which require them to disclose any inventions created during employment, to convey such rights to inventions to us and to restrict any disclosure of proprietary information. While protecting trade secrets and proprietary information is important, we are not materially dependent on maintenance of any specific trade secret or group of trade secrets. 
 During the normal course of business, we perform research and development and technology consulting services and related products in support of our customers. Typically, these services do not depend on patent protection. In accordance with applicable law, our government contracts often provide government agencies certain license rights to our inventions, copyrights and other intellectual property. Government agencies may in turn sublicense to other contractors (including our competitors) the right to utilize our intellectual property. In addition, in the case of our work as a subcontractor, our prime contractor may also have certain rights to data, information and products we develop under the subcontract. At the same time, our government contracts often license to us patents, copyrights and other intellectual property owned by third parties.
 Regulation 
 Our business is impacted by government procurement, anti-bribery, international trade, environmental, health and safety and other regulations and requirements. Below is a summary of some of the significant regulations that impact our business. 
 Government Procurement.    The services we provide to the U.S. Government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, or CAS, the Services Contract Act, the False Claims Act, export controls rules and U.S. Department of Defense security regulations, as well as many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines, contract termination or suspension of future contracts. Generally, our government clients can also terminate, renegotiate, or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience, and many of our government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually.
 In 2019, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the development of Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (“CMMC”) as a framework to assess and enhance the cybersecurity posture of the Defense Industrial Base (“DIB”), particularly as it relates to controlled unclassified information within the supply chain. CMMC is designed to ensure that contractors providing services to the U.S. Department of Defense have implemented cybersecurity controls and processes to adequately protect information that resides on DIB systems and networks.  The U.S. Department of Defense issued an interim rule on September 29, 2020 to amend the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to include one new provision and two new contract clauses.  It became effective on November 30, 2020.   We collaborated with other companies to provide feedback following the 60-day public comment period.  In December 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense identified seven approved pilots of the expected fifteen for fiscal year 2021 that are new Requests for Proposals which will be incorporated into CMMC requirements.  All offerors are expected to undergo appropriate third-party CMMC assessment and achieve certification of Level 3 and below at the time of contract award.  We are currently in compliance and is preparing for future certification and assessments.
  Anti-Bribery and other regulations.    We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both 
 15


private and public sectors. In addition, an organization that “fails to prevent bribery” committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented “adequate procedures” to prevent bribery. 
 International Trade.    We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, and the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, as well as U.S. economic and trade sanctions, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. To the extent we export items and provide services outside of the United States (or to certain parties in the United States), we must do so in compliance with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose export licensing requirements, and we may not be successful in obtaining necessary licenses and other authorizations. Further, these laws and regulations restrict our ability to export items or provide services to certain countries and certain persons, including those that are the target of OFAC sanctions. Noncompliance with these or similar laws could lead to government investigations, penalties, reputational harm, and other negative consequences, and thereby could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, any change in these laws and regulations, or any shift in the approach to their enforcement or scope, or change to the countries, persons, or items targeted by such regulations, could potentially result in our decreased ability to export or sell items or services to existing or potential customers. 
 Environmental, Health and Safety.    We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters, including, among other things, the handling, transport and disposal of regulated substances and wastes, including hazardous and radioactive materials; contamination by regulated substances and wastes; the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the acquisition of a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; the maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees, state and local government authorities and the public; and employee health and safety. Our previous ownership and current and previous operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to these laws or regulations. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and related state laws, certain persons may be liable at sites where or from a release or threatened release of hazardous substances has occurred or is threatened. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, retroactive and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Under RCRA, persons may be liable at sites where the past or present storage, handling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where disposal occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the disposal occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under RCRA is strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. Violations and liabilities with respect to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in significant administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications or revocations, operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. Additionally, Congress, state legislatures, local governing bodies and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes could result in more stringent or costly requirements for our operations. Our costs related to complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have not been material in the past and are not currently material to our total operating costs or cash flows. However, if we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations in the future, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, in the unlikely event that we are required to fund remediation of a contaminated site, the 
 16


statutory framework might allow us to pursue rights of contribution from other potentially responsible parties. 
 We maintain a compliance program designed to ensure compliance with the various regulations and requirements applicable to us. The compliance program, managed by our Chief Ethics and Compliance Counsel and overseen by our Chief Compliance Officer, includes an annual audit of performance with respect to our codes of ethics and business conduct and the adequacy of our compliance program, among other initiatives.
