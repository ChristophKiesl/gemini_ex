● | Aviation enables visibility into airport ramp personnel and assets through real-time visibility and reporting, access control, and geo-fenced security. 

 
PowerFleet for Logistics (part of our Supply Chain Solutions Product Group)
 
Our PowerFleet for Logistics solutions are designed to provide bumper-to-bumper asset management, monitoring, and visibility for over-the-road based assets (heavy trucks, dry-van trailers, refrigerated trailers, shipping containers, etc.) and their associated cargo. These systems provide mobile-asset tracking and condition-monitoring solutions to meet the transportation market’s desire for greater visibility, safety, security, and productivity throughout global supply chains.
 
By leveraging a combination of cellular, Bluetooth ®, and satellite communications and web-based data management technologies, our Logistics Visibility product family provides shippers and carriers with tools to better manage their tractors, drivers, trucks, refrigerated (Reefer) trailers, dry van trailers, chassis and container fleets. Our Logistics Visibility solutions enable quick access to actionable intelligence that results in better utilization, control, safety, compliance, and security of our customers’ freight-carrying assets.
 
Our Logistics Visibility solutions consist of a combined hardware and software as a service solution that are designed to focus on providing robust IoT monitoring, measuring, and management of the following asset types:
 

● | Tractors (e.g. Class 7-8 Vehicles): Our solutions sit in the “cab” of the truck. They are designed to be regulatory compliant (e.g. Electronic Logging Devices or ELDs) solutions that provide real-time position reports, workflow management, inspection reporting, engine performance information, two-way communication with the driver, and full Transportation Management System (TMS) integration. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Dry Van Trailers: By using asset tracking technology that leverages solar-powered super-capacitors and long-lasting batteries, along with options connected to external power, we offer a variety of mobility platforms that vary by power source and price to provide extended years of maintenance-free asset tracking and IoT performance. Our FreightCAM cargo sensor camera takes actual high definition pictures of the cargo in the dry van trailer and using machine learning can determine cube, floor space, how the trailer is loaded, identify load shifts, and help our customer’s customer know how to unload the cargo. 
● | Refrigerated Trailers / Containers: Our reefer mobility platform is integrated with all major refrigeration unit brands and sensors to allow complete remote two-way control combined with powerful dashboard and in easy-to-read reports on the status of cold chain products and cargo. Our system allows our customers to proactively manage their reefer loads versus other solutions that merely monitor temperature.

● | Chassis: We provide multiple interoperable mobility platform options, which vary by power source and price, for continuous real-time visibility of these assets while in transit, as well as more accurate arrival and departure information to better plan supply chain resource allocation. Our new weight-on-axle sensor and our algorithms for determining if the chassis has a container on it or not enable our customers to better optimize chassis utilization and improve their billing for chassis rentals. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Shipping Containers: We deliver full visibility of containers from the moment they are moved from the yard to the instant they reach their final destination to increase container utilization and reduce transit cycle times. Our container solutions also integrate with our FreightCAM enabling our container customers to get the same benefits as our dry van customers. 
● | Cargo: Images, door sensors, and ‘cargo-area’ environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, shock, etc.) for true freight visibility, root cause analysis for claims - including location and visual proof. We have unique and patent pending machine learning processes that can determine volume, load status, shifts in transit and help consignees know how to plan for unloading cargo. 

 
To increase asset utilization, our Logistics Visibility solutions can improve overall operating efficiency, increase revenue per mile, reduce claims and claims processing times, and reduce the number of assets needed by delivering our customers. This is achieved through proving such things as two-way integrated workflows for drivers, control assignments and work change, Electronic Driver Logging (ELD) and inspections for regulatory compliance, monitoring of asset pools and geofence violations, and various reporting insights that flag under-utilized assets, the closest assets, and alerts on exceeding the allotted time for loading and unloading.
 
To better control remote assets, our Logistics Visibility solutions provide our customers with technology that enables the identification of a change in cargo status, geo-fencing alerts when an asset is approaching or leaving its destination, and on-board intelligence utilizing a motion sensor and proprietary logic that identifies the beginning of a drive and the end of a drive.
 
Lastly, to help improve asset and cargo security, our Logistics Visibility solutions allow our customers to enable things such as asset lockdown with automated e-mail or text message, emergency tracking of assets (higher frequency of reports) if theft is expected, geo-fencing alerts when an asset enters a prohibited geography or location, and near real-time sensors that alert based on changes in temperature and shock, among other things.
 
PowerFleet for Vehicles (includes automotive, rental, smaller service and delivery vans)
 
Our PowerFleet for Vehicles solutions are designed both to enhance the vehicle fleet management process, whether it’s a rental car, a private fleet, or automotive original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, partners. We achieve this by providing critical information that can be used to increase revenues, reduce costs and improve customer service.
 
For example, our rental fleet management system automatically uploads vehicle identification number, mileage and fuel data as a vehicle enters and exits the rental lot, which can significantly expedite the rental and return processes for travelers, and provide the rental company with more timely inventory status, more accurate billing data that can generate higher fuel-related revenue, and an opportunity to utilize customer service personnel for more productive activities, such as inspecting vehicles for damage and helping customers with luggage.

Our solution for “car sharing” permits a rental car company to remotely control, track and monitor their rental vehicles wherever they are parked. Whether for traditional “pod-based” rental or for the emerging rent-anywhere model, the system, through APIs integrated into any rental company’s fleet management system, (i) manages member reservations by smart phone or Internet, and (ii) charges members for vehicle use by the hour.
 
For our customers with a variety of make-model-years in their fleet, we have developed an unmatched library of certified vehicle code interfaces through our second-generation On-Board Diagnostics, or OBD-II, industry standard. Our patented fleet management system helps fleet owners improve asset utilization, reduce capital costs, and cut operating expenses, such as vehicle maintenance or service and support.
 
Our fleet management solutions allow our customers to monitor their fleet vehicles using a web-based application that can monitor various parameters, including but not limited to, vehicle location, speed, engine fault codes, driver behavior, eco-driving, and ancillary sensors and can receive reports and alerts, either automatically or upon request wirelessly via the internet, email, mobile phone or an SMS.
 
We also provide stolen vehicle retrieval, or SVR, services, predominantly in Israel. Most of the SVR products used to provide our SVR services are mainly sold to (i) local car dealers and importers that in turn sell the products equipped in the vehicle to the end users who purchase the SVR services directly from us, or (ii) leasing companies which purchase our SVR services in order to secure their own vehicles. In addition, in order to increase the added value services for our car dealer customers and end users, we have developed a connected car solution which we provide based on the car infotainment system, which as of the date of this report, is offered by us in Israel only. While the connected car solution enables the car dealer to preserve continuance relationship with the end users, it provides the end users with a friendlier and richer user interface and enables us to expand our consumer target market to vehicles which do not require SVR services.
 
Analytics and Machine Learning
 
Our analytics platforms provide our customers with a holistic view of their asset activity across their enterprise. For example, in our PowerFleet for Logistics solutions, our image machine learning system allows us to process images from our freight camera and other sources and identify key aspects of operations and geospatial information such as location, work being accomplished, type of cargo, how cargo is loaded and if there are any visible issues such as damage.
 
Our cloud-based software applications provide a single, integrated view of industrial asset activity across multiple locations, generating enterprise-wide benchmarks, peer-industry comparisons, and deeper insights into asset operations. This enables management teams to make more informed, effective decisions, raise asset performance standards, increase productivity, reduce costs, and enhance safety.
 
Specifically, our analytics platforms allow users to quantify best-practice enterprise benchmarks for industrial asset utilization and safety, reveal variations and inefficiencies in asset activity across both sites and geographic regions, or identify opportunities to eliminate or reallocate assets, to reduce capital and operating costs.
 
We look for analytics and machine learning to make a growing contribution to drive platform and SaaS revenue, further differentiate our offerings and add value to our solutions, and help keep us at the forefront of the wireless mobility markets we serve, although there can be no assurance if and to what extent analytics will do so. We also use our analytics platform for our own internal platform quality control.
 
Services
 
Hosting Services. We provide the use of our systems as a remotely hosted service, with the system server and application software residing in our colocation center or on a cloud platform provider’s infrastructure (e.g., Azure, AWS). This approach helps us reduce support costs and improve quality control. It separates the system from the restrictions of the customers’ local IT networks, which helps reduce their system support efforts and makes it easier for them to receive the benefits of system enhancements and upgrades. Our hosting services are typically offered with extended maintenance and support services over a multi-year term of service, with automatic renewals following the end of the initial term.
 
Software as a Service. We provide system monitoring, help desk technical support, escalation procedure development, routine diagnostic data analysis and software updates services as part of the ongoing contract term. These services ensure deployed systems remain in optimal performance condition throughout the contract term and provide access to newly developed features and functions on an annual basis.

Maintenance Services. We provide a warranty on the hardware components of our system. During the warranty period, we either replace or repair defective hardware. We also make extended maintenance contracts available to customers and offer ongoing maintenance and support on a time and materials basis.
 
Customer Support and Consulting Services. We have developed a framework for the various phases of system training and support that offer our customers both structure and flexibility. Major training phases include hardware installation and troubleshooting, software installation and troubleshooting, “train-the-trainer” training on asset hardware operation, preliminary software user training, system administrator training, information technology issue training, ad hoc training during system launch and advanced software user training.
 
Increasingly, training services are provided through scalable online interactive training tools. Support and consulting services are priced based on the extent of training that the customer requests. To help our customers derive the most benefit from our system, we supply a broad range of documentation and support including videos, interactive online tools, hardware user guides, software manuals, vehicle installation overviews, troubleshooting guides, and issue escalation procedures.
 
We provide our consulting services both as a stand-alone service to study the potential benefits of implementing a wireless fleet management system and as part of the system implementation itself. In some instances, customers prepay us for extended maintenance, support and consulting services. In those instances, the payment amount is recorded as deferred revenue and revenue is recognized over the service period.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
We attempt to protect our technology and products through a variety of intellectual property protections, including the pursuit of patent protection in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Because of the differences in patent laws and laws concerning proprietary rights, the extent of protection provided by U.S. patents or proprietary rights owned by us may differ from that of their foreign counterparts. Where strategically appropriate, we will attempt to pursue suspected violators of our patents and, whenever possible, monetize our intellectual property.
 
We built a portfolio of patents and patent applications relating to various aspects of our technology products and solutions. As of March 3, 2021, our patent portfolio includes 43 U.S. patents, 5 pending U.S. patent applications, 3 pending foreign international applications, and 2 foreign patents. With the timely payment of all maintenance fees, the U.S. patents have expiration dates falling between 2021 and 2038. No single patent or patent family is considered material to our business.
 
Trademarks
 
We have, or have applied for, U.S. and/or foreign trademark protection for POWERFLEET®, POWERFLEET VISION®, POWERFLEET IQ®, POWRFLEET YARD®, I.D. SYSTEMS® and Design, the I.D. SYSTEMS Logo®, VEHICLE ASSET COMMUNICATOR®, VERIWISE IQ®, ASSET INTELLIGENCE®, didBOX®, FREIGHTCAM, KEYTROLLER®, REEFERMATE®, POINTER® and Design, and CELLOCATOR® and Design.
 
We attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development and sales efforts. However, it is difficult to proceed with certainty in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential at the time of the application filing, with regard to similar technologies. If we were to discover that our products violate third-party proprietary rights, we may not be able to:
 

● | obtain licenses to continue offering such products without substantial reengineering; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | re-engineer our products successfully to avoid infringement; 
● | obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; 
● | litigate an alleged infringement successfully; or 
● | settle without substantial expense and damage awards. 

 
Any claims against us relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if without merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources or in injunctions preventing us from distributing certain products. Such claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult. In general, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual safeguards may not be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us. Our failure or inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Manufacturing
 
We outsource our hardware manufacturing operations to contract manufacturers. This strategy enables us to focus on our core competencies - designing hardware and software systems and delivering solutions to customers - and avoid investing in capital-intensive electronics manufacturing infrastructure. Outsourcing also provides us with the ability to ramp up deliveries to meet increases in demand without increasing fixed expenses.
 
Our manufacturers are responsible for obtaining the necessary components and supplies to manufacture our products. While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, manufacturers generally depend on a limited number of suppliers. In the past, unexpected demand for communication products has caused worldwide shortages of certain electronic parts and allocation of such parts by suppliers that had an adverse impact on the ability of manufacturers to deliver products as well as on the cost of producing such products.
 
Due to the general availability of manufacturers for our products, we do not believe that the loss of any of our manufacturers would have a long-term material adverse effect on our business, although there could be a short-term adverse effect on our business.
 
We generally attempt to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand for products, as well as to meet anticipated sales levels. If our product mix changes in unanticipated ways, or if sales for particular products do not materialize as anticipated, we may have excess inventory or inventory that becomes obsolete. In such cases, our operating results could be negatively affected.

Government Regulations
 
The use of radio emissions is subject to regulation in the United States by various federal agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. Various state agencies also have promulgated regulations which concern the use of lasers and radio/electromagnetic emissions standards.
 
Regulatory changes in the United States and other countries in which we may operate in the future could require modifications to some of our products in order for us to continue manufacturing and marketing our products in those areas.
 
Our products intentionally transmit radio signals, including narrow band and spread spectrum signals, as part of their normal operation. We have obtained certification from the FCC for our products that require certification. Users of these products in the United States do not require any license from the FCC to use or operate our products. To market and sell our integrated wireless solutions in the European Union, we also utilize unlicensed radio spectra, and have obtained the required European Norm (EN) certifications.
 
In addition, some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state and local laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state and local laws governing chemical substances in electronic products.
 
The adoption of unfavorable regulations, or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected markets to become impractical or otherwise adversely affect our ability to produce or market our products.
 
Since 1996, our subsidiary Pointer has held an operational license, which is renewed on a regular basis, from the Ministry of Communications in Israel to operate our wireless messaging system over 2 MHz in the 966 to 968MHz radio spectrum band.
 
Our subsidiary Pointer Argentina S.A. (“Pointer Argentina”) obtains domestic licenses for the deployment of our SVR operation in Argentina and local operators are required to obtain a specific license for their operations.
 
We are currently registered by the Federal Department of Security (SEGOB) in Mexico to provide our services.
 
Our subsidiary Pointer SA (PTY) Ltd. (“Pointer South Africa”) is currently registered as a security service provider under the Private Security Industry Regulation Act, 2001 in South Africa. Our products are also listed with ICASA (Independent Communications Authority of South Africa).
 
Our Cellocator division obtains licenses from the Israeli Ministry of Communications in order to manufacture, import, market and sell its products in Israel.
 
While the use of our cellular monitoring units does not require regulatory approvals, in Israel, the use of our radio frequency products is subject to regulatory approvals from government agencies. In general, applications for regulatory approvals to date have not been problematic. This being said, we cannot guarantee that approvals already obtained are or will remain sufficient in the view of regulatory authorities indefinitely.
