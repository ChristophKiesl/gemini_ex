Item 1. Business
Overview
World Fuel Services Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Florida in July 1984 and along with its consolidated subsidiaries is referred to collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K (“2016 10‑K Report”) as “World Fuel,” “we,” “our” and “us.”
We are a global energy management company involved in providing energy procurement advisory services, supply fulfillment and transaction and payment management solutions to commercial and industrial customers, principally in the aviation, marine and transportation industries. We have offices throughout the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions, including: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and the United States ("U.S.").

Segments
We operate in three reportable segments consisting of aviation, marine and land. 
Aviation Segment
Our aviation‑related service offerings include fuel management, price risk management, ground handling, 24/7 global dispatch services, and international trip planning services, including flight plans, weather reports and overflight permits. In addition, we offer card payment solutions and related processing services and technology. Because fuel is a major component of an aircraft’s operating costs, our customers require cost effective and professional fuel services. We have developed an extensive network of third‑party suppliers and service providers that enables us to provide aviation fuel and related services throughout the world. We believe the breadth of our service offering combined with our global supplier network is a strategic differentiator that allows customers to secure fuel and high‑quality services in locations worldwide on short notice.
We purchase our aviation fuel from suppliers worldwide, which may be delivered into our customers’ aircraft or to a designated storage facility located at one of our suppliers’ locations, pursuant to arrangements with them. Inventory is purchased at airport locations or shipped via pipelines and held at multiple locations for strategic reasons. We engage in contract sales, which are sales made pursuant to fuel purchase contracts with customers who commit to purchasing fuel from us over the contract term. We also conduct spot sales, which are sales that do not involve continuing contractual obligations by our customers to purchase fuel from us. Our cost of fuel is generally tied to market‑based formulas or is government controlled.
Marine Segment
Through our extensive network, we provide our customers with real‑time global market intelligence and rapid access to quality and competitively priced marine fuel 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Our marine fuel-related services include management services for the procurement of fuel, cost control through the use of price risk management offerings, quality control, claims management, and card payment solutions and related processing services.

We serve primarily as a reseller, and accordingly, in those instances we take delivery for fuel purchased from our supplier at the same place and time as the fuel is sold to our customer. We also sell fuel from our inventory, which we maintain in storage facilities that we own or lease. We also serve as a broker and in those cases we are paid a commission for negotiating the fuel purchase transaction between the supplier and the end user and for expediting delivery of the fuel. 
The majority of our marine segment activity consists of spot sales. Our cost of fuel is generally tied to spot pricing or market‑based formulas or is government controlled. We also contract with third parties to provide various services for our customers, including fueling of vessels in ports and at sea, and transportation and delivery of fuel and fuel-related products.
Land Segment
Our land related services include management services for the procurement of fuel and price risk management. We primarily conduct these activities throughout most of the U.S. as well as parts of the U.K. and Brazil. We also offer advisory and fulfillment solutions with respect to power, natural gas and other energy products through Kinect, our global energy management solutions business.
In addition, we offer transaction management services, which include card payment solutions, merchant processing services, payment solutions for tolls across Europe, government payment systems for global fuel procurement and commercial payment programs.
In connection with our fuel marketing activities, we serve as a reseller, and in those instances we purchase fuel from a supplier and contemporaneously resell it to our customers through spot and contract sales. The fuel is generally delivered to our customers directly or to a designated tanker truck loading terminal commonly referred to as “racks,” which are owned and operated by our suppliers or other third‑parties. We also maintain inventory in certain strategic locations, including pipelines. Our cost of fuel is generally tied to market‑based formulas. 
During each of the years presented on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, none of our customers accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenue.
Competitors
We operate globally across industries that are highly fragmented with numerous competitors. Our competitors range in size and complexity from large multinational corporations, principally major oil producers, which have significantly greater capital resources, to relatively small and specialized firms. We compete with major oil producers that market fuel directly to the large commercial airlines, shipping companies and petroleum distributors operating in the land transportation market as well as fuel resellers. We believe that our extensive market knowledge, worldwide footprint, logistics expertise, and the use of price risk management offerings give us the ability to compete within those markets.
Within each of our segments we may enter into derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations and also to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs. Financial information with respect to our business segments and the geographic areas of our business is provided below and within Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this 2016 10-K Report.
Seasonality
Our operating results are subject to seasonal variability. Our seasonality results from numerous factors, including traditionally higher demand for natural gas and home heating oil during the winter months and aviation and land fuel during the summer months, as well as other seasonal weather patterns. As such, our results of operations may fluctuate from period to period.

Regulation
Our business activities are subject to substantial regulation by federal, state and local government agencies, inside and outside of the U.S., which enforce laws and regulations governing the transportation, sale, storage and disposal of fuel and the collection, transportation, processing, storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including waste oil and petroleum products. For example, U.S. federal and state environmental laws applicable to us include statutes that: (i) allocate the cost of remedying contamination among specifically identified parties and prevent future contamination; (ii) impose national ambient standards and, in some cases, emission standards, for air pollutants that present a risk to public health or welfare; (iii) govern the management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; and (iv) regulate the discharge of pollutants into waterways. International treaties also prohibit the discharge of petroleum products at sea. The penalties for violations of environmental laws include injunctive relief, recovery of damages for injury to air, water or property, and fines for non‑compliance. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors,” and “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.”
We may also be affected by new environmental laws and regulations that will apply to us or our customers in the future, some of which could increase the cost or reduce the demand for our products and services. For example, due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions. In the U.S., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has finalized rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions by petroleum product suppliers and facilities meeting certain annual emissions thresholds and to regulate emissions from major sources of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. In other countries, proposed regulations include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy.  Although the ultimate impact of these or other future measures is difficult to accurately predict, they could make our products more expensive or reduce demand for petroleum products, as well as shift demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources. This, in turn, could affect our operations, earnings and competitive position.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements made in this report and the information incorporated by reference in it, or made by us in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), press releases, teleconferences, industry conferences or otherwise, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” “plan,” or words or phrases of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve risks, uncertainties or other factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. The Company’s actual results may differ materially from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s expectations, beliefs and assumptions concerning future events affecting us, which in turn are based on currently available information.
Examples of forward-looking statements in this 2016 10-K Report include, but are not limited to, our expectations about the conditions in the marine, land and aviation markets, cost reduction initiatives, the timing, cost and benefits of our multi-year project and upgrade of our Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) platform, the timing for closing the acquisition of assets from ExxonMobil affiliates and funding of the purchase price, as well as expectations regarding our government business, our business strategy, business prospects, operating results, effectiveness of internal controls to manage risk, working capital, liquidity, capital expenditure requirements and future acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding our ability to obtain required consents and satisfy closing conditions in acquisitions, our ability to capitalize on new market opportunities, the demand for our products, the cost, terms and availability of fuel from suppliers, pricing levels, the timing and cost of capital expenditures, outcome of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances.  These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect.

We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict all of those risks, nor can we assess the impact of all of those risks on our business or the extent to which any factor may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. The forward-looking statements in this 2016 10-K Report are based on assumptions management believes are reasonable.  However, due to the uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.  Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and unless required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to publicly update any of them in light of new information, future events, or otherwise. Any public statements or disclosures by the Company following this report that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in or accompanying this 2016 10-K Report will be deemed to modify or supersede such forward-looking statements.
For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.
