LCD-From Global Perspective
 
The global demand of LCD panels is continually increasing. The output area of global LCD panels achieved 181 million square meters in 2017, this figure was tripled compared to 2007, and the average annual growth is approximately 13 million square meters. According to the prediction, the global demand of LCD panels will be 215 million square meters in 2021.From 2017 to 2021, the compound average growth rate (CAGR) of such demand will be about 4.37%, though the growth seems to slow down compared with the CAGR of 5% for the most recent 3 years, however, without considering base effect, the demand will maintain an average increase of approximately 8.5 million square meters per annum.
 
The demand of twisted nematic (TN) and supper twisted nematic (STN) liquid crystal materials remains generally stable. Due to their characteristics such as low cost, wide range of applications, the low-end TN and STN liquid crystal materials will still take a certain portion of market for terminal products which require a relatively low level of display. Basically, since 2004, the market demand of TN and STN liquid crystal materials has been stable, with the annual quantity demand maintaining at approximately between 60 and 70 tons, to compute based on the average price of about 5000 Yuan/kg for TN and STN liquid crystal materials, the predicted market scale for TN and STN liquid crystal materials would be approximately 300 million to 350 million Yuan.
 
There is a strong demand of thin film transistor (TFT) liquid crystal materials in the global market as well. TFT liquid crystal materials account for over 80% of total output value in the global liquid crystal materials market. With the rapid development of LCD television, laptop, desktop display and mobile communication, the demand of TFT liquid crystal panel keeps increasing. To measure and calculate on the basis of 80% of effective display area, a liquid crystal material usage of 4.5kg per square meter area of panel and an average price of 15,000 Yuan per kilogram for mixed liquid crystal materials, the quantity demand of global TFT mixed liquid crystals in 2016 was about 617 tons and market scale was around 9.3 billion Yuan. The global quantity of TFT mixed liquid crystals is estimated to be about 666 tons and the market scale will be about 10 billion Yuan in 2021.
 
LCD-From China’s Perspective
 
China is one of the largest display panel producers in the world, according to the data provided by China Optics and Optoelectronics Industry Association LCB. Recently, the liquid crystal panels in mainland China reached the top rank in the world in terms of both revenue and output area. China is and has been a big display manufacturing country, however, China is now at a crucial time for change and attempting to evolve from a big country to a powerful display manufacturing country. China is developing out of a “catch up” position into a phase of advance or equal footing with other competing countries and has an opportunity to become an industrial leader in the near future. It is understood that in the past year, there were multiple panel manufacturing lines have been put into production or started construction in China, especially the Gen 10.5/11 panel manufacturing lines and many Gen 6 AMOLED manufacturing lines were under construction, which just brings China closer and closer to the position of being one of, if not the largest production regions for display panels in the world. China has a number of OLED panel lines put into production or expansion. The scale of investment in OLED is expected to reach $30 billion to $50 billion over the next 3-5 years. BOE, CSOT, Visionox, Tianma and many other manufacturers have launched products such as flexible display, full-screen display, special-shaped display and so on, the domestic high-end displays in China are developing rapidly. The capacity of display panels of China is expected to become the first among all the countries in 2022.
LCD-From Industrial Perspective
 
At present, the OLED panel Market for mobile phones is almost monopolized by South Korea, with Samsung display accounting for 93.5% and LGD accounting for 2.1%. The influence of Chinese manufacturers is very small, with 2.0% of VINSIONOX, 1.4% of EverDisplay Optronics (EDO) and 0.6% of BOE, which together are less than 5%. From 2019, China began to exert influence on the OLED market. It is estimated that BOE's shipment will reach 50 million pieces (with an annual increase of 1900%), EDO 30 million (with an annual increase of 417%), Vinsionox's 20 million pieces (with an annual increase of 150%), and Tianma's 10 million pieces (with an annual increase of 1011%).
Distribution Methods of Products
 
The Company’s products are currently directly shipped from the manufacturers to the distributors and retailers. Marketing and sales departments were established through the Company’s indirect subsidiaries to cope with the growth of the Company. We explore the potential customer bases using internal resources. Currently, we have both the long-term contracts with our customers and manufacture according to the purchase orders received. In the future, we will continue to seek additional channels of distribution for our products to include wholesale stores and mass retailers. The Company plans to focus primarily on distributing its products regionally, starting in Greater China, and will then seek to expand its distribution channels across the U.S. and internationally.
