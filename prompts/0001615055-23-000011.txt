Overview
IsoPlexis is empowering labs to leverage the cells and proteome changing the course of human health. Our systems assess cell behavior, providing functional data that contributes to understanding mechanisms of disease progression, treatment resistance and therapeutic efficacy to advance human health. We are a life sciences company building solutions to accelerate the development of curative medicines and personalized therapeutics. Our award-winning single-cell proteomics systems reveal unique biological activity in small subsets of cells, allowing researchers to more directly assess in vivo biology and develop more precise and personalized therapies.
We are enabling deeper access to in vivo biology and driving durable and potentially transformational research on disease in a new era of advanced medicine. We believe our platform is the first to employ both proteomics, or the study of proteins and their functions, and single-cell biology in an effort to fully characterize and link cellular function to patient outcomes by revealing mechanisms underlying treatment response and disease progression. Our proteomics platform, which includes instruments, chip consumables and software, provides an end-to-end solution to reveal a more complete view of protein function both at a global and an individual cellular level, using the same instrument. Since our commercial launch in June of 2018, our platform has been adopted by all of the top 15 global biopharmaceutical companies by revenue and three-fourths of the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) designated comprehensive cancer centers in the United States to help develop more durable therapeutics, overcome treatment resistance, and predict patient responses for advanced immunotherapies, cell therapies, gene therapies, vaccines, and regenerative medicines. While our initial focus has been on developing applications of our platform for cancer immunology and cell and gene therapy, we are now expanding our capabilities to include applications for infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases.
Bulk methods of proteomic analysis, which analyze proteins in bulk samples that could be made up of many different types of cells, can be helpful to identify differences between groups in samples such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”). But because individual cells, even of the same cell type (such as tumor cells or immune cells) can act very differently, single-cell resolution is necessary to gain a better understanding of cell function. Single-cell biology provides deep insights into variations among each individual cell’s behavior, such as underlying disease activity and therapeutic response, and is becoming a valuable tool for life science research. Single-cell functional analysis provides additional insight that can be missed by traditional bulk proteomic analyses, which delivers average cell activity in the aggregate. For example, in cell therapy, where heterogeneous populations of immune cells are engineered to combat tumors, traditional bulk proteomic methods can detect average differences between products, while single-cell functional analysis can identify the unique immune cell subsets that contribute most significantly to effective treatment responses. At the same time, while the genome of single cells has been explored in depth, genomics alone has limitations on accurately predicting treatment resistance, which often results from tumor protein signaling adaptations rather than genetic aberrations. In oncology, while genomics has been used to reveal mutations that reside along druggable pathways, therapeutics targeting these pathways have only marginally improved patient outcomes, with almost universal and rapid development of drug resistance. We believe that our platform can capture a more complete view of the functional biological drivers of disease and therapeutic response.
We designed our platform to reveal functional protein biology and cellular signaling networks to accelerate the development of advanced medicines. The drivers of efficacy and toxicity are heavily impacted by cytokines, or extracellular functional proteins, through which certain individual cells send and receive signals. Additionally, disease progression and treatment resistance are heavily impacted by the intracellular signaling proteins, in particular phosphoproteins, which dictate the functional state of any cell. We believe that directly capturing the full range of intracellular and extracellular functional proteins is critical to analyzing the efficacy of therapies, identifying biomarkers suitable for druggable targets, and modifying therapeutics that are not generating the intended result. Our technology fills a critical knowledge gap by directly detecting the full range of intracellular and extracellular functional proteins within a sample, using the same instruments to connect bulk and single-cell functional cell analysis.
Figure 1. The figure below represents the evolution of single-cell biology from the study of the genomic blueprint of a cell—its DNA and RNA—through the functional representation of each cell’s activity—its extracellular and intracellular proteins. This evolution towards the proteome is enabling greater application to translational medicine.
Our platform is an end-to-end solution comprised of our proprietary IsoLight and IsoSpark instruments, IsoCode and CodePlex chip consumables, and IsoSpeak software. Our IsoLight and IsoSpark instruments are designed to be automated benchtop proteomic hubs with integrated software that decreases the need for manual analysis steps. Our IsoCode chips utilize our core technology leveraging our proteomic barcoding to capture single-cell protein information. Our CodePlex chips leverage our core technology to assay multiplexed bulk proteins from very low volumes. Our IsoSpeak software interprets these data and is capable of rapidly returning comprehensive data figures, allowing users to quickly evaluate results, and advanced visualizations, which facilitate exploring complex data sets for additional insights. We believe that our platform overcomes many of the limitations of traditional proteomic workflows, which can be capital-intensive, time-consuming and laborious, require multiple instruments and many manual steps that increase the opportunity for error and variability, and may only be capable of analyzing small numbers of functional proteins at a time. Our platform supports multiple applications, including in cancer immunology, cell and gene therapy, infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases.

Our current product offering supports a variety of applications that are broadly used for translational, preclinical and clinical development of advanced medicines, representing an initial $12 billion addressable market opportunity based on management estimates. This cumulative market spend accounts for an installed base of approximately 55,000 instruments, in line with mature protein and cell biology technologies such as flow cytometry and multiplexed proteomics. Our relevant end users span the range of biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research institutions worldwide, which in the aggregate cover approximately 5,500 advanced medicine programs in both preclinical and clinical stages. In addition to our currently targeted addressable market opportunity in advanced medicines, we have expanded our capabilities with intracellular protein detection IsoCode chip products, which are designed to improve discovery biology as a bridge to the earlier development of advanced medicines. These products have been used to identify mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in cancer cells, helping to provide mechanistic insights that can inform treatment decisions. We believe this represents an incremental $12 billion addressable market opportunity. Expanding our chip solution portfolio is a key factor in enabling us to expand our capabilities into applications for infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases.
As of December 31, 2022, we have placed 286 systems globally, including at each of the top 15 global biopharmaceutical companies by revenue and approximately three-fourths of the comprehensive cancer centers in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we employed a commercial team of approximately 100 team members. We market and sell our platform, which is currently marketed to customers as research use only, through a direct sales channel in North America and specific regions in Europe. Additionally, we utilize thirteen distributor relationships to market and sell our products in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.
Our revenue to date has been driven primarily by sales of our instruments and chip consumables. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $16.8 million and $17.3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our sales to end-markets of biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research institutions represented approximately 60% and 40% of our total sales, respectively. We generated net losses of $106.0 million and $81.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Pending Acquisition by Berkeley Lights, Inc.
On December 21, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Berkeley Lights and Iceland Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkeley Lights (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into IsoPlexis, with IsoPlexis continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkeley Lights (the “Merger”). The consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval by Berkeley Lights stockholders of the issuance of shares of Berkeley Lights common stock to IsoPlexis stockholders in connection with the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement by IsoPlexis’ stockholders.
The IsoPlexis Advantage
We designed our platform to reveal functional protein biology and cellular signaling networks at single-cell and bulk resolution to accelerate the development of advanced medicines and improve patient outcomes by revealing treatment response and disease progression. As of December 31, 2022, use of our platform has generated approximately 55 predictive data sets and our technology has been referenced in approximately 110 publications. We believe that our platform offers several advantages over existing proteomic and cellular analysis technologies, including:
Direct single-cell analysis of functional proteins: We designed our platform to directly measure the functional proteins from each cell in a highly multiplexed manner. For example, our platform is capable of directly measuring the proteomic activity of each cell—such as T cells, macrophages, or cancer cells—providing highly correlative clinical and preclinical immune biomarkers. In contrast, while technologies such as RNA sequencing provide information useful for estimating cellular protein function, the correlation between such information and functional proteins is relatively low, making it difficult to translate the information from these technologies into insights for therapeutic applications. Similarly, flow cytometry cannot detect the highly multiplexed extracellular functional proteins from each cell that may directly correlate to in vivo response.
Multiple proteomic applications on a single system: We designed our technology to provide highly multiplexed information from bulk and single-cell extracellular proteome and the intracellular proteome, all on the same system. Our approach, which leverages a single system, is designed to increase efficiency and accessibility across many areas of advanced cellular analysis for a wide range of applications.
Rapid data analysis and insights: Gathering insights from current single-cell technologies can take months due to the limitations of current solutions in collecting and analyzing data. Our IsoSpeak software provides advanced automated data analysis with a push-button user interface that can be run with limited technological expertise and is capable of generating insights and comprehensive data figures within hours, that are in a format that would be suitable for inclusion in a research publication submission. By streamlining and accelerating the data collection process, we believe our platform could potentially help our customers get actionable results faster and shorten research timelines.
Ultra-low sample volume requirements: Many traditional bulk proteomic workflows require relatively large sample volume, which can be a challenge for customers since samples are often very limited. We designed our platform to maximize the utility of the limited sample volume that our customers obtain from their clinical trials or animal models. Our IsoCode and CodePlex chip consumables require sample volumes as small as 8 µL, allowing for multiplexed analysis of samples that are difficult to obtain, such as cerebrospinal fluid and tracheal samples.
Simplified workflow and minimal footprint: Many traditional bulk proteomic workflows and single-cell workflows are laborious and time consuming, requiring many manual steps across multiple instruments performed by skilled technicians. After a sample is loaded onto one of our chips, which is then inserted into our IsoLight or IsoSpark instrument, our platform automates all protein detection steps in a walk away fashion, saving time and laboratory resources and reducing opportunities for error or variability. Our automated ELISA, or a standard immunoassay, workflow reduces the need for specialized technicians to run experiments or interpret results and reduces overhead. Without our platform, similar workflows would require multiple instruments that would occupy a substantially larger combined footprint compared to the benchtop placement of our instruments, which have a total footprint of 28.5 inches (in the case of the IsoLight) or 18 inches (in the case of the IsoSpark). We believe ease of use of our fully automated benchtop instruments, combined with their minimal footprint, drives customers to adopt our platform at a lower system and labor cost.
Our Platform
Our platform is an end-to-end solution comprised of our proprietary IsoLight and IsoSpark instruments, IsoCode and CodePlex chip consumables, and IsoSpeak software, spanning multiple applications. Once a sample is loaded onto our proprietary “proteomic barcoded” IsoCode or CodePlex chips, highly sensitive software-enabled optics quantify the proteins associated with each single-cell through individualized antibody-based proteomic reactions.
Our platform leverages a series of chambers that capture single cells, where each separate chamber enables multiplexed protein detection reactions simultaneously in a parallelized fashion. The highly multiplexed number of functional proteins per cell quantified by our platform’s proteomic barcoding has led to correlative insights in cancer immunology, cell and gene therapy, infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases.
Our Instruments
Our IsoLight and IsoSpark instruments, both Red Dot Design Award winners, run our IsoCode and CodePlex chips, enabling high-throughput analysis of functional proteins from single cells and low sample volume bulk with a fully automated workflow. The IsoLight has a footprint of 28.5 inches while the IsoSpark is a compact 18 inches. Both instruments are comprised of four modules:
•an optical system to assess protein expression;
•a fluidic system to enable the automated ELISA workflow that allows the user to insert samples and retrieve answers with limited hands on time;
•a mechanical system to enable analysis of eight samples for single-cell analysis or 96 samples for bulk analysis in the IsoLight, or four samples for single-cell analysis or 48 samples for bulk analysis in the IsoSpark, simultaneously; and
•a thermal system to provide for the incubation of single cells to capture their proteomic reactions.
Our Chip Consumables
IsoCode chips: Our highly multiplexed chip solutions for single-cell functional proteomics
Our IsoCode single-cell chip solutions provide highly multiplexed applications to capture the functional extracellular and intracellular proteome.
Our single-cell extracellular protein detection chip solution, which we also refer to as our single-cell extracellular proteome solution, works through a series of steps:
•first, the sample is prepared and retained in suspension;
•second, live cells are loaded onto the chip; and
•third, the live cells housed in the single-cell chambers secrete their extracellular proteins, which are captured by our proteomic barcode.
Similarly, our single-cell intracellular protein detection chip solution, which we also refer to as our single-cell intracellular proteome solution, works through a series of similar steps:
•first, the sample is prepared and retained in suspension;
•second, live cells are loaded onto the chip; and
•third, these live cells are lysed within each single-cell chamber to release their intracellular components, which are then captured by our proteomic barcode.
In each case, our IsoLight or IsoSpark then detects the expression of these proteins per cell and determines the protein profile of each single-cell.
Figure 3. The IsoCode chip solution workflow
CodePlex chips: Our multiplexed solutions for ultra-low volume bulk samples
Our CodePlex chip solutions provide highly multiplexed applications to capture the functional extracellular and intracellular proteome from low volume of bulk protein samples, rather than from single cells. These extracellular and intracellular proteome solutions work through a series of steps:
•first, the protein sample is retained with minimal preparation or dilution;
•second, the protein sample is loaded into the chip through various ports to allow for multiple samples per chip; and
•third, each sample is retained in its respective chamber in which the proteins are captured by our proteomic barcode.
Our IsoLight or IsoSpark then detects the relative concentration of these proteins in bulk and determines the protein profile of each sample.
Figure 4. The CodePlex chip solution workflow
Our Software
Our IsoSpeak software, an Edison Award winner, takes complex high-dimensional data and automates analysis with an intuitive push-button user interface to deliver same-day single-cell and bulk proteome visualizations without the need for highly specialized informatics professionals. The software works by retaining the images of the proteins detected on the IsoLight or IsoSpark, analyzing the images for expression of those proteins using fluorescence, and then converting the information into actionable insights through various data visualizations.
Our Services
In addition to selling our products, we leverage our platform to provide research support and services to our customers. We process samples from certain of our customers using our platform and return to these customers the immune response data generated from their samples. We also provide post-warranty services to our customers who have purchased our instruments.
Our Applications across the Drug Development Continuum
Our IsoCode single-cell extracellular proteome solution measures the extracellular functional proteins from each cell in a highly multiplexed manner, allowing for complete single-cell functional characterization. This solution enables the comprehensive profiling of the extracellular function of a wide variety of immune cell types, resulting in the generation of correlative data sets in the fields of cancer immunology and cell and gene therapy, which have been our initial areas of focus. The differentiated information that has been obtained has been applied preclinically to evaluate immune and cell therapy candidates and processes. Additionally, it has generated key biomarkers of immune response in early clinical studies and forms the basis of our initial addressable market for advancing preclinical and clinical trials within advanced medicines. This chip solution has been leveraged by a number of high impact clinical studies published in reputable scientific journals such as Cell and Blood. See “—Customer Case Studies.”
Our IsoCode single-cell intracellular proteome solution simultaneously measures multiple intracellular protein signaling networks at the single-cell level, allowing for detection of critical protein-protein interactions and signaling networks in rare cells and cell subsets. These various protein signaling networks form the basis of both functional and dysfunctional activity in a wide variety of cell types. Our single-cell intracellular proteome solution enables a better understanding of these signaling networks, which can then be applied to treat dysfunction in tumor cells and to facilitate activation of key immune cell types earlier in the therapeutic discovery process. The ability to target these signaling networks provides access to serve a discovery-focused market, enabling us to address opportunities in the fields of infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases.
Our CodePlex bulk extracellular proteome and intracellular proteome solutions provide means to achieve highly multiplexed, low sample volume proteomics. CodePlex requires up to 10 times less sample volume versus other comparable methods of analyses, opening up opportunities for precious sample analysis in preclinical and clinical studies. The CodePlex solution enables automated proteomic analyses on customers’ benchtops within one IsoLight or IsoSpark system, eliminating the need for multi-instrument workflows that require technician expertise to run. Our CodePlex solution is used across multiple applications for assaying proteins from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tracheal samples in both preclinical and clinical studies in the fields of cancer immunology and cell and gene therapy. Further, we expect that our initial entry into the clinical diagnostics market will start with our CodePlex solution as it provides accessibility to end users through automation.
Customer Case Studies
Each of the case studies described below leveraged our IsoCode single-cell extracellular proteome solution by detecting immune cell protein responses within our IsoCode chip and detecting unique extracellular protein signatures from subsets of these immune cells that predicted or correlated with treatment response or disease progression. The unique extracellular protein signature in each case study was defined by the ability of the cells to produce multiple proteins simultaneously, which we refer to as a sample having polyfunctional strength, or PSI.
Analyzing treatment response and product potency in CAR-T cell therapy study
As published in Blood, in a 20 subject non-Hodgkin lymphoma study sponsored by Kite Pharma, researchers using our platform determined that the PSI of each CAR-T cell therapy product, prior to infusion, had a significant association with complete or partial patient response to anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy. Other pre-infusion metrics tested in this study using alternative methods were not predictive. Through this research, we were able to highlight the important role a functionally versatile subpopulation of CAR-T cells may play in the potency of anti-CD19 therapies. We believe product-based readouts like this one have the potential to enable more predictive and scalable manufacturing and product release of cell therapies globally.
Early indicators of response or relapse in CAR-T therapy optimization
As published in Nature, in a CD19 and CD22 bispecific CAR study, researchers using our platform showed that certain functional protein production was associated with early signs of response to CAR-T therapies or signs of relapse in patients with large B-cell lymphoma. The researchers found that functional protein production could be a meaningful attribute to predict the potency of cell therapies. We believe product-based readouts like this one have the potential to guide cell therapy manufacturing and optimization as a critical quality attribute.
Analyzing treatment response and product potency in TIL therapy study
As published in Nature, in a study of adoptive cell therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (“TILs”) for lung cancer, researchers using our platform determined that polyfunctionality of CD8 T cells was associated with the impact of 
the infusion of TILs on immune response. Recognizing that PSI is a metric for efficacy of cell therapies, the researchers compared the ability of T cells to secrete functional proteins before and after TIL infusion and found that polyfunctionality increased after TIL treatments. Our platform’s functional readouts have been shown to be critical for understanding the potency and durability of cell therapies.
Understanding progression of disease and inflammation to enable therapy development in a COVID-19 study
As published in Cell, in collaboration with Merck & Co. and the Institute for Systems Biology, researchers using our platform identified that the PSI of peripheral monocytes increased with COVID-19 severity, while CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cell percentages decreased, revealing which of these cells contributed to the pro-inflammatory environment in moderate to severe cases of COVID-19. Our platform’s characterization of immune biomarkers at each stage of COVID-19 progression is helping researchers to identify and develop treatments and critical prognostic biomarkers, based on functional profiles of critical subsets of immune cells.
Additional studies have shown correlations between biomarkers identified using our platform and the ability to predict responses across different types of immunotherapy studies.
Our Market Opportunity
Our current product offering supports a variety of applications which are broadly used for translational, preclinical and clinical development of advanced medicines, representing an initial $12 billion addressable market opportunity based on management estimates. This cumulative market spend accounts for an installed base of approximately 55,000 instruments, in line with mature protein and cell biology technologies such as flow cytometry and multiplexed proteomics. Within this addressable market, our relevant end users span the range of biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research institutions worldwide, which cover approximately 5,500 advanced medicines programs in both preclinical and clinical stages.
In addition to our currently targeted addressable market opportunity in advanced medicines, we have recently expanded our capabilities with our intracellular protein detection IsoCode chip products, which are designed to improve discovery biology as a bridge to earlier development of advanced medicines. We believe this represents an incremental $12 billion addressable market opportunity. Additionally, we are pursuing a range of integrated applications around sequencing and proteomic analytes from single cells, which will enable further applications for discovery biology. Expanding our chip solution portfolio is a key factor in enabling us to expand our capabilities into applications for infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases. Furthermore, our long-term strategy is ultimately to add additional applications serving clinical diagnostics research that will allow us to serve additional markets we believe to be worth approximately $10 billion. We expect that our initial entry into the clinical diagnostics market will start with our CodePlex solution for quantitative low-volume bulk proteomics as it provides accessibility to end users through automation. We believe investments in these areas will provide access to a potential $34 billion total addressable market.
Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to establish our platform as a leading proteomic workflow solution in the life sciences industry. In pursuit of that goal, the key elements of our growth strategy include:
Promoting our platform as the standard for single-cell proteomic analysis
We believe that our platform is a critical tool that provides new and accessible layers of biological data at the single-cell level, and the ability to capture the functional extracellular and intracellular proteome from single cells for the first time. We believe that our platform is well positioned to fundamentally advance therapeutic discovery and development. We intend to continue promoting our instruments, chip consumables, and software to drive awareness of the broad utility of our platform for development of advanced medicines and the discovery of biomarkers.
Expand the installed base of our IsoLight and IsoSpark instruments with new and existing customers
As of December 31, 2022, we have placed 286 systems worldwide within leading biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research institutions in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Utilizing our multi-channel sales and distribution network, we intend to continue engaging with the global life sciences community to grow our installed base and expand the number of instruments within organizations that are already utilizing our technology to advance their research and therapeutic development. Outside of North America, we intend to leverage our distributor partnerships across four continents to expand our presence, with an emphasis on the China market.
Drive adoption of our existing applications
We founded our company to help solve critical challenges to accelerating advanced medicines and, since our inception, we have developed multiple applications spanning cancer immunology, cell and gene therapy, infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases. We intend to continue promoting our platform to help meet the urgent need to develop new therapeutics and accelerate development timelines across these applications. We intend to continue promoting the discoveries and data published by our customers, which we believe will further reinforce the value of our platform and drive additional adoption of our platform for use across these applications.
Develop new applications across multiple cell types, therapeutic classes, and indications
As we continue to deploy our platform, we intend to concurrently expand the breadth of applications for our technologies to encourage increased use of our platform across our addressable markets. At present, we believe we have the ability to reveal insights in functional proteomics in new therapeutic classes and indications, such as infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases. We continue to develop new methods to allow for the analysis of additional cell types on our platform, allowing IsoPlexis to expand into additional research areas. Our goal is to continue innovating and bringing new products to market as new areas of therapeutic development emerge.
Expand adoption of our platform into new geographical markets
We currently market and sell our technology with an in-house commercial team in the United States, China and Europe. We are also utilizing our distribution network to market and sell across multiple countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Japan, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We intend to further expand our international presence by growing our distribution networks in Brazil, India, Mexico and beyond.
Integrate sequencing biology with proteomics
We intend to further develop our product roadmap to integrate sequencing and functional proteomic biology from single cells to enable novel applications in discovery biology through our newest product, Duomic. Currently, single-cell solutions are limited in their ability to detect genomic and transcriptomic information and functional proteins concurrently from single cells. Based on our core technology leveraging our proteomic barcoding, Duomic utilizes our existing instrumentation to give researchers the ability to simultaneously measure functional protein and gene expression levels from the same cell. We believe that the ability to modulate and modify genomic activity in cells and detect genomic impacts can be enhanced by verifying the proteomic, or functional, impacts concurrently from the same cell. Our technology’s ability to reveal this multi-omic connectivity across cellular pathways may be able to provide earlier therapeutic insights for developers of advanced medicines.
Our Commercial Organization
We launched our first product in June 2018 and have sold our products primarily to biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research institutions. Market adoption has accelerated since our initial commercial launch with 77 instruments sold in 2022 and 98 instruments in 2021. We have a global customer base with 207 systems placed in North America, 29 in EMEA and 50 in Asia-Pacific, in each case as of December 31, 2022.
We continue to invest in our commercial team of approximately 100 people as of December 31, 2022, including 25 sales representatives. Beyond our direct salesforce, we have relationships with thirteen distributors covering countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Continued investment in research and development is critical to the commercialization of our future products. Our deep product and application roadmap represents one of the key growth drivers of instrument and consumable sales. We intend to expand our intellectual property and research capabilities through internally developed efforts, in conjunction with strategic partners and by acquiring technology.
Our Product Development Approach
Our research and development teams, located in Branford, Connecticut, design and develop our proprietary products utilizing and combining expertise in single-cell biology, fluidics, optics, informatics, hardware and software engineering. Our collaborative approach across disciplines helps lead to advancements in technology development intended to provide 
clarity on new layers of complex biology to advance curative medicines. To complement our growth strategy, both in the near term and long term, we plan to focus our research and development on:
New applications
We intend to focus our research and development efforts on developing new high value, highly differentiated applications that unlock new proteomically driven biology and drive the future of disease understanding and development of advanced medicines. Our focus in the near term includes new applications for infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neurological diseases.
New panels and protocols
We intend to focus on developing new panels, protocols, and analyte targets for each application family to cover the full range of our customers’ biological needs. Our research and development efforts in this area are centered on expanding our menu of test panels for single-cell extracellular proteomics, single-cell intracellular proteomics and low volume bulk proteomics to include, for example, T cell signaling panels for single-cell and low volume bulk analysis. Our focus in the near term also includes releasing protocols for additional types of immune cells, tumor cells and neural cells.
Integrating proteomics with sequencing-based technologies
We also intend to focus on integrating proteomics technologies with sequencing-based technologies to extend existing capacities in single-cell biology through our new multi-omic product, Duomic. Based on our core technology leveraging our proteomic barcoding, Duomic utilizes our existing instrumentation to give researchers the ability to simultaneously measure functional protein and gene expression levels from the same cell. We believe that this integration will enable a better understanding of the connections between the transcriptome and the proteome, and will have applications for cancer immunology, cell and gene therapy and neurological diseases.
Additionally, we also intend to focus on developing software that automates and streamlines advanced analytics, enabling immediate insights, and working with clinical partners to put in place validated tests that build a long-term path to clinical usage of our solutions.
Our research and development costs were $23.5 million and $21.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 88 employees in research and development. We will continue investing in efforts to support the ongoing development of our instruments, chip consumables and software, as well as enhance the overall performance of our solutions.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 290 employees. Of these employees, 88 were engaged in research and development activities, and we employed a commercial team of approximately 100 team members. 262 of these employees are located in the United States and 28 of these employees are located across Europe and Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Scientific Advisory Board
We have assembled a highly qualified scientific advisory board composed of advisors who have deep expertise in the fields of nanotechnology, biomedical engineering and medicine. Our scientific advisory board is composed of Rong Fan, Ph.D. (our co-founder and chair of the scientific advisory board), James R. Heath, Ph.D., David Ho, M.D., Arnold Levine, Ph.D., Ross Levine, M.D., and Antoni Ribas, M.D., Ph.D.
Facilities
Our principal executive offices are located in Branford, Connecticut, where we lease approximately 24,932 square feet of office and manufacturing space. The lease for our principal executive offices is currently scheduled to terminate on 
December 31, 2026. In addition to our principal executive offices, we lease additional offices and manufacturing space in Branford, Connecticut and additional offices in Kent, England and Shanghai, China.
We do not currently own any real property. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs and believe that we should be able to renew each of our leases without an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, we believe that if we require additional office space or manufacturing facilities, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We manufacture our instruments and chip consumables in our manufacturing facilities in Branford, Connecticut and do not outsource any of our production manufacturing to third party contract manufacturers. Certain of our suppliers of certain critical components and materials are single source suppliers and we do not have supply agreements with certain suppliers of these critical components and materials beyond purchase orders. As part of our overall risk management strategy, we continue to evaluate and identify alternative suppliers for each of our components and materials.
Competition
We face significant competition in the life sciences technology market. We currently compete with many established technology companies in the flow cytometry, cellular analysis and single-cell -omics businesses. This includes companies that design, manufacture and market systems, consumables and software for, among other applications, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, single-cell analysis and immunology, and/or provide services related to the same. These companies include Becton, Dickinson and Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., each of which has products that compete to varying degrees with some but not all of our products. Growing understanding of the importance of single-cell information is leading to more companies offering services related to collecting such information. Our target customers may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems or using traditional methods, rather than implementing our platform, and they may also decide to stop using our platform. In addition, there are many large established players in the life sciences technology market that we do not currently compete with but that could develop systems, tools or other products that will compete with us in the future. These large established companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development staff or more established marketing and sales forces.
For further discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The life sciences technology market is highly competitive. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and results of operation will suffer” in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
Our products are currently marketed (and we currently intend to continue to market them) as research use only (“RUO”) and we sell them to biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research institutions that conduct research. The FDA defines RUO products as in-vitro diagnostic tests (“IVDs”) that are in the laboratory research phase of development and, if properly labeled, the FDA exempts RUO products from most FDA regulatory controls. RUO products must bear the statement: “For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures.” RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. The FDA will evaluate the totality of the circumstances when determining if the product is intended for diagnostic purposes and, if the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices and would require clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The FDA defines a medical device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent or other similar or related article, including any component part or accessory, which is (i) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (ii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. The development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of medical devices, which includes IVDs, are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) and comparable state and international agencies. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, design, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, pre-market clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, marketing, promotion, sales, distribution and import and export of medical devices. To be commercially distributed in the United 
States, medical devices must receive from the FDA either clearance of a premarket notification, known as 510(k), or premarket approval pursuant to the FDC Act prior to marketing, unless subject to an exemption. Sales of devices for diagnostic purposes may also subject us to additional healthcare regulation. We continue to monitor the changing legal and regulatory landscape to ensure our compliance with any applicable rules, laws and regulations. For further discussion of the risks we face relating to regulation by the FDA and related regulatory agencies, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation—If our current or future products become subject to FDA or other related international regulation, the regulatory clearance or approval and the maintenance of continued and post-market regulatory compliance for such products will be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain both in timing and in outcome” in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.
In the United States, various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective in most material respects beginning on January 1, 2023. The CPRA further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements and obligations and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing the CCPA and CPRA. While we are not currently subject to the CCPA and CPRA, we may in the future be required to comply with such laws, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Furthermore, the CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.
In addition, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the European Commission’s jurisdictional reach of its data privacy and security laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data. EU member states are tasked under the GDPR to enact, and have enacted, certain implementing legislation that adds to and/or further interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal data. In particular, the GDPR includes requirements to establish a legal basis for processing, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals, a strengthened individual data rights regime, requirements to implement safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, data breach notification obligations to appropriate data protection authorities or individuals, limitations on retention and secondary use of information and additional obligations when entities contract with third-party processors to process personal data. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, data privacy and security laws that are substantially similar to the GDPR are in effect in the United Kingdom, which carry similar risks and authorize similar fines for certain violations. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. We continue to monitor the changing legal and regulatory landscape to ensure our compliance with any applicable rules, laws and regulations.
For further discussion of the risks we face relating to data privacy and related regulations, see “Risk factors—General Risks—We are currently subject to, and may in the future become subject to additional, U.S. federal and state laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Ensuring compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our future customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue” in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technology is fundamental to the long-term success of our business. We rely on a combination of intellectual property protection strategies, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements and technical measures designed to protect the intellectual property and commercially valuable confidential information and data used in our business.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 51 issued U.S. patents, 21 pending U.S. patent applications, two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications that have not entered national stage, 58 issued foreign patents and 32 pending foreign patent applications in various foreign jurisdictions, including the European Patent Office, Japan, China, and Hong Kong. Excluding any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, our owned issued patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2037 and our owned patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2028 and 2043. 
Various of our owned issued patents and patent applications relate to out automated proteomic systems, including our IsoLight and IsoSpark instruments, IsoSpeak software, and our IsoCode and CodePlex chip consumables. We also have patents and patent applications related to products or technologies that are under development or are on our development roadmap. 
As of December 31, 2022, we exclusively licensed seven issued U.S. patents, four pending U.S. patent applications, seven issued foreign patents and ten pending foreign patent applications in various foreign jurisdictions. Excluding any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, our exclusively in-licensed issued patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2038 and our exclusively in-licensed patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2028 and 2038. Our exclusively in-licensed issued patents and patent applications relate to our automated proteomic systems, including our IsoCode chip consumables.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using or commercializing any of our patented inventions will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both our owned and in-licensed intellectual property, we cannot provide any assurance that any of our current or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents in any particular jurisdiction, or that any of our current or future issued patents will effectively protect any of our products or technology from infringement or prevent others from commercializing infringing products or technology.
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, products and technologies, we also seek to protect our brand through the procurement of trademark rights. We own registered trademarks and pending trademark applications for “IsoPlexis,” “IsoLight,” “IsoCode,” “CodePlex,” “IsoSpeak” and other product related brand names in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to strengthen our competitive position. We currently maintain as trade secrets our software and certain other technologies, including assays. To mitigate the chance of trade secret misappropriation, we enter into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to our trade secrets, such as our employees, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions they have developed while working for us. We generally control access to our proprietary and confidential information through the use of internal and external controls. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Additionally, we use certain open source software in our products and services, including our IsoSpeak software, and anticipate using open source software in the future. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our services. For further discussion of the risks relating to intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.
License Agreements
Yale University
In April 2014, we entered into a license agreement (as amended and restated in July 2014 and November 2015, and as further amended in December 2016, January 2018 and July 2021, the “Yale Agreement”) with Yale University (“Yale”). Pursuant to the Yale Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable (subject to certain restrictions), worldwide license to certain patent rights and certain information related to (i) multiplexed detection to manufacture, use and commercialize products in all fields of use and (ii) high-throughput single-cell polyomics to manufacture, use and commercialize products in all fields of use except in the field of spatial biomolecular analysis. We also obtained a non-exclusive license to certain patent rights and certain information related to high-throughput single-cell polyomics to manufacture, use and commercialize products in the field of spatial biomolecular analysis. The license granted pursuant to the Yale Agreement is subject to certain rights retained by (i) the United States government under the Bayh-Dole Act and (ii) Yale (on behalf of itself and other non-profit academic and/or research institutions) to make, practice and use the licensed patent rights and licensed products for research, clinical, teaching and other non-commercial purposes. Such rights retained by the United States government and Yale are typical for a license from a U.S. university or research institution, and we believe such rights do not pose a material risk to our business. We may sublicense the licensed patent rights subject to certain conditions, including that any sublicense agreement must contain terms consistent with the terms of the Yale Agreement and we must pay Yale a low double-digit percentage of our sublicense income. Furthermore, in connection with the first two sublicense agreements we enter into, we are obligated to pay Yale certain milestone payments that may equal up to $15,000 in the aggregate.
In connection with entering into the Yale Agreement, we issued 7,772 shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock to Yale valued at approximately $51,000 at the time of issuance. We then amended the Yale Agreement in January 2018 (the “January 2018 Amendment”) to obtain an exclusive license to certain additional patent rights which include device, system and method of use claims directed to high-throughput single-cell polyomics to manufacture, use and commercialize products in all fields of use, which we subsequently amended in July 2021 to make the license exclusive in all fields except in the field of spatial biomolecular analysis only. Pursuant to the January 2018 Amendment, in consideration for the inclusion of these patent rights, we issued 3,374 shares of Series B-2 redeemable convertible preferred stock to Yale valued at approximately $100,000 at the time of issuance. In addition, we must pay Yale a customary annual license maintenance royalty (“LMR”) in the low six-figure dollars, as well as low single-digit percentage earned royalties on worldwide cumulative net sales of licensed products, which royalties are subject to reduction upon the occurrence of certain events as specified in the Yale Agreement. The LMR is credited against earned royalties due by the Company in the same calendar year. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred $0.1 million in royalty expense under the Yale Agreement. 
Upon our IPO in October 2021, all of our outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were automatically converted to shares of common stock. Accrued dividends payable in respect of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were settled through the issuance of shares of common stock. Accordingly, Yale received 93,558 shares of common stock upon the closing of our IPO. 
Under the terms of the Yale Agreement, we are required to use reasonable commercial efforts to develop and sell the licensed products, including incurring minimum annual expenses on research and development with respect to the licensed products, and we are restricted from developing, manufacturing or selling products that compete with the licensed products. Yale controls the filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights at our expense, subject to our ability to comment or approve certain related actions. We have the first right and obligation to institute a suit for infringement of the licensed patent rights and defend against any claim of invalidity or declaratory judgment action brought against the licensed patent rights. If we do not institute such suit or defend against such actions within a certain period of time, Yale has the right to convert the exclusive license granted under this license agreement to a non-exclusive license.
Unless terminated earlier, the Yale Agreement will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the later of the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent right in a country or ten years after the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country. The last to expire of the licensed issued patents under the Yale Agreement will expire in 2034 and the last to expire of the licensed patent applications under the Yale Agreement, if issued, will expire in 2038. Subject to an applicable cure period, Yale may terminate the Yale Agreement if we fail to comply with applicable payment obligations or upon a material breach of our obligations under the Yale Agreement, including our diligence obligations. Yale may also terminate the Yale Agreement if we fail to maintain adequate liability insurance or if we, directly or indirectly, challenge or oppose the validity, patentability or enforceability of any of the licensed patent rights, or if any of our sublicensees do so and we do not terminate the relevant sublicense agreement within a certain specified amount of 
time. The Yale Agreement automatically terminates if we cease to carry on our business for a certain specified period of time or for certain specified insolvency-related events. We may terminate the Yale Agreement at any time by providing advance written notice. Subject to a cure period, we may terminate the Yale Agreement upon material, uncured breach by Yale. Either party may terminate the Yale Agreement, on a country-by-country basis, if neither party elects to undertake the defense of a suit alleging infringement for a certain period of time in a country.
California Institute of Technology
In March 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Caltech Agreement”) with the California Institute of Technology (“Caltech”), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable (subject to certain restrictions), worldwide license to certain patent rights related to methods and compositions for quantifying metabolites to manufacture, use and commercialize products in the field of detecting metabolites, including proteins and other analytes. The licenses granted pursuant to the Caltech Agreement are subject to certain rights retained by (i) the United States government under the Bayh-Dole Act and (ii) Caltech to make, import and use the licensed products for non-commercial purposes and to grant other non-profit institutions rights under the licensed patent rights and licensed technology for educational and research purposes. Such rights retained by the United States government and Caltech are typical for a license from a U.S. university or research institution, and we believe such rights do not pose a material risk to our business. We may sublicense the licensed patent rights and technology subject to certain conditions, including that any sublicense agreement must contain terms consistent with the terms of the Caltech Agreement, and we must pay Caltech a low double-digit percentage of our sublicense income.
In connection with entering into the Caltech Agreement, we issued 2,830 shares of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock to Caltech valued at approximately $50,000 at the time of issuance. Upon our IPO in October 2021, all of our outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were automatically converted to shares of common stock. Accrued dividends payable in respect of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were settled through the issuance of shares of common stock. Accordingly, Caltech received 23,719 common shares upon the closing of our IPO. In addition, we must pay Caltech a royalty on the exclusively licensed patent rights at a low single-digit percentage of net revenues on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis (with an annual minimum royalty in the range of low to mid five-figure dollars), which obligation will continue until the expiration of all patent claims covering such licensed product in such country. For any country in which the exclusively licensed patent rights do not include any valid claims, we must pay Caltech a royalty on the non-exclusively licensed technology at a lower single-digit percentage of net revenues for a period of ten years from the first commercial sale. In the event that we fail to commercialize products that incorporate the licensed patents or technology, the annual minimum royalties due to Caltech will increase in accordance with the terms of the Caltech Agreement. We are also required to pay Caltech a mid-teen percentage of sublicensing revenue. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred an immaterial amount in royalty expense pursuant to the Caltech Agreement. There are no potential future milestone payments under the Caltech Agreement.
Under the terms of the Caltech Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed products. In the event that we fail to commercialize the licensed products, the annual minimum royalty payment due to Caltech will increase in accordance with the Caltech Agreement. Caltech controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications at our expense, subject to our ability to comment on certain related actions. Caltech also has the first right to institute a suit and defend against a declaratory judgment action pertaining to infringement or invalidity of the licensed patent rights.
Unless terminated earlier, the Caltech Agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent right, or as long as we are obligated to pay royalties under the Caltech Agreement. The last to expire of the licensed patent applications under the Caltech Agreement, if issued, will expire in 2036. Subject to an applicable cure period, Caltech may terminate the Caltech Agreement if we fail to comply with applicable payment obligations, fail to maintain adequate liability insurance or upon a material breach of our obligations under the Caltech Agreement, including our diligence obligations, our obligation to mark licensed products with applicable patent numbers, our exploitation of any licensed patent rights outside of the licensed field or our cessation of commercial activities in the licensed field. Caltech may also terminate the Caltech Agreement for certain specified insolvency-related events. We may terminate our license to any particular licensed patent or patent application at any time by providing advance written notice. Subject to a cure period, we may terminate the Caltech Agreement upon material, uncured breach by Caltech.
