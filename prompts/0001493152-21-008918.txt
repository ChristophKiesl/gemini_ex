ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BACKGROUND- MERGER AND SPIN-OFF
 
OVERVIEW
 
Amergent Hospitality Group Inc. was incorporated on February 18, 2020 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chanticleer Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Chanticleer” or “Parent”) for the purpose of conducting the business of Chanticleer and its subsidiaries after completion of the spin-off of all the shares of Amergent to the shareholders of Chanticleer.
 
In connection with and prior to its merger (“Merger”) with Sonnet BioTherapeutics Holdings Inc., a New Jersey Corporation (“Sonnet”), Chanticleer, contributed and transferred to Amergent, a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Chanticleer, all of Chanticleer’s business, operations, assets and liabilities, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement between Chanticleer and Amergent dated March 31, 2020. The contributed assets included the stock interest in all Chanticleer’s subsidiaries (other than Amergent and the merger-sub formed for the purposes of effecting the merger (“Merger-Sub”). On March 16, 2020, pursuant to the disposition agreement between Chanticleer and Amergent dated March 25, 2020 (“Disposition Agreement”), the Chanticleer board declared a dividend with respect to the shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on March 26, 2020 of one share of the Amergent common stock for each outstanding share of Chanticleer common stock. The dividend, which together with the contribution and transfer of Chanticleer’s restaurant business, assets and liabilities described above, is referred to herein as the “Spin-Off,” was paid on April 1, 2020. Prior to the Spin-Off, Amergent engaged in no business or operations.
 
All of Chanticleer’s then current restaurant business operations were contributed to Amergent and the stockholders of record received the same pro-rata ownership in Amergent as in Chanticleer.
 
As a result of the Spin-Off, Amergent emerged as successor to the business, operations, assets and liabilities of pre-merger Chanticleer. Additionally, Amergent’s shareholder base and their holdings (on a pro-rata basis) are identical to that of pre-merger Chanticleer.
 
The financial information included in this Report include the accounts of Amergent and its subsidiaries combined with Chanticleer and its subsidiaries. Since all of Chanticleer’s then current restaurant business operations were contributed to Amergent and the stockholders of record received the same pro-rata ownership in Amergent as in Chanticleer, the Spin-Off has been recognized by Amergent at the carrying value of the assets and liabilities contributed by Chanticleer. Further, as a common control transaction, the financial statements of Amergent reflect the transaction as if the contribution had occurred as of the earliest period presented in the respective financial statements included herein.
 
AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE SPIN-OFF
 
Following the separation and distribution, Amergent and Parent operate separately and independently.

Debenture Refinancing
 
In connection with and prior to the Merger and Spin-Off, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement between Chanticleer, Amergent, Oz Rey LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and certain other purchasers dated April 1, 2020, Chanticleer was released from all of its obligations under its 8% secured debentures. The 8% debentures were cancelled. In exchange Amergent (i) issued 10% secured convertible debentures in principal amount of $4,037,889 in Amergent to Oz Rey, LLC, (iii) issued 10-year warrants to purchase up to 2,462,400 shares of common stock to the purchasers at an exercise price of $0.125, and (ii) issued a 10-year warrant to purchase 462,600 shares of common stock to Oz Rey, LLC at an exercise price of $0.50 ($0.50 Warrants”) and (iii) remitted $2,000,000 of the proceeds of the Merger to Oz Rey, LLC (minus $650,000 previously advanced, plus expenses). Upon issuance, the debenture was able to be converted at any time with limitations as described below at the option of holder at the lower of $0.10 per share and the volume weighted average price for Amergent’s common stock 10 trading days immediately prior to delivery of the conversion notice. The warrants include a cashless exercise provision. The debentures and warrants include standard anti-dilution provisions as well as weighted average anti-dilution protection in the event Amergent shares are issued below either the exercise/conversion price of the warrants/debenture or the volume weighted average price of Amergent’s common stock for the five trading days immediately prior to issuance of such other securities. The obligation is subject to a first priority security interest in substantially all the assets (excluding the segregated account securing the repayment of the guaranteed return on Series 2 Preferred and Spin-Off Entity Warrant) of Amergent and is guaranteed by all Amergent’s subsidiaries.
 
On August 17, 2020, the Company and Oz Rey amended the 10% secured convertible debenture to fix the conversion rate into common stock at $0.10 per share. Further, the amendment provides a limitation on Oz Rey’s ability to convert the debenture into common stock so that the conversion would not result in the issuance of common stock exceeding the number of authorized shares. Oz Rey may; however, upon reasonably notice to the Company, require the Company to include in its proxy materials, for any annual meeting of shareholders being held by the Company, a proposal to amend the Company’s certificate of incorporation to increase the Company’s authorized shares to a number sufficient to allow for conversion of all shares underlying the debenture, on a fully diluted basis. Oz Rey also agreed that the Company would not be required under any circumstances to make a cash payment to settle the conversion feature not exercisable due to the authorized share cap or in an event that the Company was unable to deliver shares under the conversion feature. Oz Rey also agreed to waive any event of default under the debenture that occurred or existed prior to August 17, 2020.

Pursuant to a registration rights agreement, Amergent granted the investors registration rights for shares of common stock underlying the 10% secured convertible debenture and warrants.
 
Further, contingent upon the termination of Amergent’s interest in the Spin-Off Entity Warrant and Oz Rey, LLC’s cash exercise of $0.50 Warrants, Amergent will assign to Oz Rey, LLC, from the Spin-Off Entity Warrant, a warrant to purchase up to one share of Sonnet’s common stock for each twenty-six $.050 Warrants exercised, up to a maximum of 17,792 shares of Sonnet’s common stock.
 
For as long as Oz Rey, LLC holds 10% debentures, it has the right, but not the obligation, to appoint two directors (“Appointees”) to Amergent’s board. Amergent agreed that its board or governance committee, if it has one, will re-nominate the Appointees as a directors at annual meetings. and recommend that stockholders vote “for” such Appointees at annual meetings. All proxies given to management also voted in favor of such Appointees. This right to designate the Appointees is subject to Nasdaq Listing Rules in the event Amergent seeks listing on one of the exchanges of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
SPIN-OFF PROCEEDS AND ASSUMED LIABILITIES
 
Cash Proceeds
 
In connection with the Merger, on April 1, 2020, Chanticleer received proceeds from Sonnet of $6,000,000.
 
Of these proceeds,
 

● | $2,929,987.37 was remitted directly to satisfy outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities of Chanticleer immediately prior to the closing, including the following: satisfaction in full of outstanding secured credit facilities with Towne Bank (formerly Paragon Bank), payment to Oz Rey, LLC pursuant to securities purchase agreement dated April 1, 2020 refinancing outstanding 8% debentures reducing principal and reimbursing expenses, redemption of Series 1 Preferred Stock, required payment to holders of certain outstanding warrants; repayment of bridge loan received from Sonnet, and payment of Chanticleer’s legal fees and expenses; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | $1,250,000 was remitted directly, on behalf of Amergent, to a segregated cash account securing Amergent’s Series 2 Preferred Stock obligation, pursuant to the requirements of securities purchase agreement dated February 7, 2020; and 
● | $1,820,012.63 was remitted to Amergent. 

Spin-Off Entity Warrant
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Sonnet issued the Spin-Off Entity Warrant to Amergent. It is a warrant to purchase 186,161, representing 2% of the aggregate outstanding shares of Sonnet, at an exercise price per share of $0.01. It has 5-year term. The Spin-Off Entity Warrant may not be exercised for 180 days from the date of issuance and is a company asset. The underlying shares will not be distributed to shareholders when it is exercised.
Assumed Liabilities
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, related Contribution Agreement and Distribution Agreement, Amergent assumed all liabilities of Chanticleer that were not paid-off at the effective time of the Merger.

Pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement, Amergent agreed to fully indemnify and hold harmless each of Chanticleer and Sonnet, and each of their respective, directors, officers, stockholders and managers who assumes such role upon or following the closing of the Merger against all actual or threatened claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, administrative, investigative or otherwise, related to the Spin-Off Business prior to or in connection with its disposition to Amergent. In addition, Amergent acquired the Tail Policy to cover its indemnification obligations to the indemnitees under the Indemnification Agreement. The Tail Policy of up to $3.0 million was prepaid in full by Amergent, at no cost to the indemnitees, and will be effective for six years following the consummation of the disposition.
 
As part of the Merger, all of the assets and liabilities of Chanticleers and its subsidiaries were contributed to Amergent.
 
Various subsidiaries of Amergent are delinquent in payment of payroll taxes to taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $3.0 million of employee and employer taxes (including estimated penalties and interest) was accrued but not remitted in years prior to 2019 to certain taxing authorities by certain of these subsidiaries for cash compensation paid. As a result, these subsidiaries are liable for such payroll taxes. These subsidiaries have received warnings and demands from the taxing authorities and management is prioritizing and working with the taxing authorities to make these payments in order to avoid further penalties and interest. Failure to remit these payments promptly could result in increased penalty fees.
 
In connection with the Merger, former executive officer of Chanticleer, Richard Adams, filed a claim for damages against American Roadside Burgers, Inc., Chanticleer’s wholly owned subsidiary for unpaid severance. Mr. Adams received timely notification of non-renewal of his employment agreement, which expired December 31, 2019, but argues he is entitled to severance benefits triggered by the Merger. Amergent has been advised by legal counsel that Mr. Adam’s claim is frivolous and that he has a low probability of success. Mr. Adams complaint alleges damages in an amount over $25,000.
 
Assumption of Series 2 Preferred Stock
 
In connection with the Merger and Spin-Off, all 787 outstanding shares of Series 2 Preferred Stock of Chanticleer were automatically exchanged for substantially identical shares of preferred stock in Amergent. The holders of Series 2 Preferred also received an aggregate of 1,426,845 shares of common stock in Amergent. The Amergent board approved the certificate of designations rights and preferences of Series 2 Preferred Stock, more fully set forth in a certificate of designations filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware and authorized the designation and immediate issuance of 787 shares of Series 2 Preferred. In addition, pursuant to Chanticleer’s original agreement with the investors, Amergent issued 5-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 350,000 shares of Amergent’s common stock to the investors at $1.25 per share. Each share of Series 2 Preferred has a stated value of $1,000. In the event the proceeds received by the investor from the sale of all the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of Series 2 Preferred Stock in both Amergent and its former Parent (“Conversion Shares”) do not equal at least $1,875,000 on August 10, 2020, Amergent must pay the investors an amount in cash equal to the difference between $1,875,000 and the proceeds previously realized by the investors from the sale of the Conversion Shares, net of brokerage commissions and any other fees incurred by investor in connection with the sale of Conversion Shares (the “True-Up payment”). The balance will be paid by Amergent out of either (i) the proceeds from the exercise by Amergent of existing Spin-off Entity Warrants to purchase shares of the common stock of Sonnet or (ii) from a segregated cash account. The segregated cash account was funded in the amount of $1,250,000 at closing of the Merger from $6,000,000 in proceeds received from Sonnet.
 
The True-up payment is accounted for as a derivative instrument. The fair value of the derivative was estimated using a Monte Carlo model and a liability of $529,000 was recorded at the Series 2 Preferred Stock issuance date. The fair value is updated at each reporting date and the liability was $184,800 at December 31, 2020 as reported in the consolidated and combined balance sheet.

The Series 2 Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of holder at the lesser of (i) $1.00 (subject to adjustment for forward and reverse stock splits, recapitalizations and the like) or (ii) 90% of the five day average volume weighted average price of the common, provided the conversion price has a floor of $0.50 (subject to adjustment for forward and reverse stock splits, recapitalizations and the like) Conversion is subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 4.99%. This limitation may be increased by the holder up to 9.99%, with 61 days’ notice. No dividends shall be declared or paid on the Series 2 Preferred Stock. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Amergent, the holder shall be entitled to receive out of the assets, whether capital or surplus, an amount equal to 125% of the stated value plus any default interest and any other fees or liquidated damages then due and owing thereon under the certificate of designations, for each share of Series 2 Preferred before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of Amergent common stock. The holder of Series 2 Preferred will vote together with the holders of common stock as a single class on an as-converted basis on all matters presented to the holders of common stock and shall vote as a separate class on all matters presented to the holders of Series 2 Preferred. Assuming conversion of Series 2 Preferred Stock into common stock at either $0.50 or $1.00 per share the holders of the Series 2 Preferred Stock would receive 1,574,000 or 787,000 shares of common stock and entitled to that number of votes, respectively. In addition, without the approval of the holder, Amergent will not, (i) sell all or substantially all of its assets, merge or consolidate with another entity or voluntarily liquidate or dissolve the corporation, (ii) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series 2 Preferred, (iii) authorize or create any class of stock ranking as to dividends, redemption or distribution of assets upon a liquidation senior to, or otherwise pari passu with, the Series 2 Preferred Stock, (iv) amend its certificate of incorporation, as amended, or other charter documents in any manner that adversely affects any rights of the holder, (v) increase the number of authorized shares of Series 2 Preferred Stock, (vi) redeem any shares of capital stock of the company (other than any redemption of securities from officers or employees of the company pursuant to existing contractual arrangements with such officers or employees or in connection with the termination of their employment) or (vii) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. Breach of Amergent’s obligations and other circumstances set forth in the Certificate of Designation will trigger a redemption event. The Certificate of Designations provides for customary adjustments in the event of dividends or stock splits and anti-dilution protection.
 
On August 17, 2020, Amergent and the holders of Series 2 Preferred entered into a Waiver, Consent and Amendment to Certificate of Designations (“COD Amendment”) extending the True-Up Date to December 10, 2020. In exchange, (i) Amergent issued warrants to purchase 134,000 shares of common stock to the holders of Series 2 Preferred, (ii) issued a cash payment of $66,000 to the holders of Series 2 Preferred agreed to pay expenses of the holders of Series 2 Preferred incurred in connection with the Amendment and (iii) released the holders of Series 2 Preferred from claims related to the Certificate of Designations and the holders’ investments in Amergent or its predecessor. Other than the issuance date, the new warrants are identical to the original warrants issued to the Series 2 Preferred investors. An Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock (“Amended COD”) that provides for the extension of the True-Up Date to December 10, 2020 and provides that the Amergent may not access any portion of funds held in the segregated account until the obligations under Series 2 Preferred are satisfied in full, was filed on August 17, 2020.
 
On February 16, 2021, the Company and the holders of the Series 2 Preferred Stock entered into a Waiver, Consent and Amendment to the Certificate of Designations (the “Waiver”). Pursuant to the Waiver, the Company filed the Second Amendment and Restated Certificate of Designations of Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock (“Amended COD”) (i) providing for the extension of the True-Up Payment to April 1, 2021, (ii) providing for the deduction of proceeds to the original holders from sales of Series 2 Preferred for the True-Up Payment, with the Delaware Secretary of State and (iii) providing for a reduction in amount required to be held in a segregated cash account from $1,250,000 to $850,000.

BUSINESS
 
Amergent is in the business of owning, operating and franchising fast casual dining concepts domestically and internationally.
 
We operate and franchise a system-wide total of 35 fast casual restaurants of which 26 are company-owned and included in our consolidated and combined financial statements, and 9 are owned and operated by franchisees under franchise agreements.

-


American Burger Company (“ABC”) is a fast-casual dining chain consisting of 3 locations in North Carolina and New York, known for its diverse menu featuring fresh salads, customized burgers, milk shakes, sandwiches, and beer and wine.
 
BGR: The Burger Joint (“BGR”) was acquired in March 2015 and currently consists of 7 company-owned locations in the United States and 9 franchisee-operated locations in the United States and the Middle East.
 
Little Big Burger (“LBB”) was acquired in September 2015 and currently consists of 15 company-owned locations in the Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, and Charlotte, North Carolina areas. Of the company-owned restaurants, 8 of those locations are operated under partnership agreements with investors we have determined we are the primary beneficiary as we control the management and operations of the stores and the partner supplies the capital to open the store in exchange for a noncontrolling interest.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we operated 1 company-owned Hooters full-service restaurant in the United Kingdom. Hooters restaurants are casual beach-themed establishments featuring music, sports on large flat screens, and a menu that includes seafood, sandwiches, burgers, salads and Hooters original chicken wings.
 
Through the use of partnerships, the Company partners with private investors who contribute all or substantially all of the capital required to open a restaurant in return for an ownership interest in the LLC and an economic interest in the net income of the restaurant location. The Company manages the operations of the restaurant in return for a management fee and an economic interest in the net income of the restaurant location. While terms may vary by LLC, the investor generally contributes between $250,000 and $350,000 per location and is entitled to 80% of the net income of the LLC until such time as the investor recoups the initial investment and the investor return on net income changes from 80% to 50%. The Company contributes the intellectual property and management related to operating a Little Big Burger, manages the construction, opening and ongoing operations of the store in return for a 5% management fee and 20% of net income until such time as the investor recoups the initial investment and the Company return on net income changes from 20% to 50%.
 
Additionally, we utilize franchise agreements to allow third parties to franchise a restaurant, and thus, are able to utilize the intellectual property, trademark, and trade dress in return for a franchise fee. The franchise agreement provides the franchisee with a designated territory or marketing area for an initial term of 10 years, with four successive five- year renewals. An upfront fee of $40,000 is required along with a $5,000 renewal fee and continuing fees based on a percent of revenues. We recognize the upfront fee allocated to each restaurant as revenue on a straight-line basis over the restaurant’s license term, which generally begins upon the signing of the contract for area development agreements and upon the signing of a store lease for franchise agreements. The payments for these upfront fees are generally received upon contract execution. Continuing fees, which are based upon a percentage of franchisee revenues (typically 5.5%) and are not subject to any constraints, are recognized on the accrual basis as those sales occur. The payments for these continuing fees are generally made on a weekly basis.
 
Franchises must be operated in strict compliance with our operations manual, which prescribes staffing requirements, minimum months, days and hours of operation, techniques and processes for service, length and method of training personnel, working capital and inventory requirements, accounting system and other operational standards. We provide up to five days of on-site training at no charge to franchisee. Additional on-site training may be requested by franchisee and will be provided at a daily rate of $500. We have the right to approve the property lease for each new franchise. We maintain image control and may direct a franchise to remodel. We provide specifications for equipment, safety and security, subject to additional location regulations. Franchisees must utilize designated, approved suppliers or obtain pre-approval of any new supplier. Franchisees have certain prescribed marketing requirements and we may require franchisee to contribute a percentage of net sales to a regional brand development fund. Further, we may require certain of franchisee’s personnel to attend an annual conference or all franchisee’s personnel to attend refresher training, at franchisee’s sole expense.
 
Franchisees have sole control over the day-to-day operations of the franchise. The franchisee is responsible for the hiring and termination of its personnel and compliance with applicable laws. Franchisee must sell wine and beer at the store and may opt to sell other alcoholic beverages. Franchisee is responsible for obtaining all required business licenses, including liquor licenses and to carry required insurance.
 
Any improvements or new concepts developed by a franchisee (such as improvements to proprietary recipes, equipment, merchandise or software) belong to us. Our franchise agreement contains confidentiality and non-disclosure covenants and franchisee must require its personnel to execute confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.

We also operate 1 Hooters location in the United Kingdom. Hooters restaurants are casual beach-themed establishments featuring music, sports on large flat screens, and a menu that includes seafood, sandwiches, burgers, salads, and of course, Hooters original chicken wings and the “nearly world famous” Hooters Girls. Amergent started initially as an investor in Hooters of America and subsequently evolved into a franchisee operator. We continue to hold a minority investment in corporate owned Hooters. However, we do not currently intend to open additional Hooters restaurants and instead plan to utilize the cash flows from these two restaurants to support growth in our other fast casual brands.
 
Restaurant Geographic Locations
 
United States
 
We currently operate ABC, BGR and LBB restaurants in the United States. ABC is in North Carolina and New York. BGR operates company restaurants in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as franchise locations across the US and internationally. LBB operates in Oregon, Washington and North Carolina. We also operate gaming machines in Portland, Oregon under license from the Oregon Lottery Commission.
Europe
 
We currently own and operate one Hooters restaurant in the United Kingdom located in Nottingham, England.
 
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is extremely competitive. We compete with other restaurants on the taste, quality and price of our food offerings. Additionally, we compete with other restaurants on service, ambience, location and overall customer experience. We believe that we compete primarily with local and regional sports bars and national casual dining and quick casual establishments, and to a lesser extent with quick service restaurants in general. Many of our competitors are well-established national, regional or local chains and many have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees.
Proprietary Rights
 
We have trademarks and trade names associated with American Burger, BGR and Little Big Burger. We believe that the trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights that we use in our restaurants have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concepts. Although we believe that we have sufficient rights to all of our trademarks and service marks, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to market our restaurants and promote our brand. Any such litigation may be costly and divert resources from our business. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may be prevented from using our trademarks or service marks in the future and may be liable for damages.
 
We also use the “Hooters” mark and certain other service marks and trademarks used in our Hooters restaurant pursuant to our franchise agreements with Hooters of America.
 
Government Regulation
 
Environmental regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations have not had a significant impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

10
--


Local regulation
 
Our locations are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, which may include health, sanitation, safety, fire, building and other agencies in the countries, states or municipalities in which the restaurants are located. Opening sites in new areas could be delayed by license and approval processes or by more requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors. Our agreements with our franchisees require them to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.
 
Each restaurant requires appropriate licenses from regulatory authorities allowing it to sell liquor, beer and wine, and each restaurant requires food service licenses from local health authorities. Our licenses to sell alcoholic beverages may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, including violation by us or our employees of any law or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control. We are subject to various regulations by foreign governments related to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages and to health, sanitation and fire and safety standards. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.
 
Franchise Regulations
 
We must comply with regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and with several state and foreign laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising (“FTC Rule”) and certain state and foreign laws require that we furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise disclosure document containing information prescribed by the FTC Rule and applicable state and foreign laws and regulations. We register the disclosure document in domestic and foreign jurisdictions that require registration for the sale of franchises. Our domestic franchise disclosure document complies with FTC Rule and various state disclosure requirements, and our international disclosure documents comply with applicable requirements.
 
We also must comply with state and foreign laws that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. These laws may limit a franchisor’s ability to: terminate or not renew a franchise without good cause; interfere with the right of free association among franchisees; disapprove the transfer of a franchise; discriminate among franchisees regarding charges, royalties and other fees; and place new stores near existing franchises. Bills intended to regulate certain aspects of franchise relationships have been introduced into the United States Congress on several occasions during the last decade, but none have been enacted.
 
Employment Regulations
 
We are subject to state and federal employment laws that govern our relationship with our employees, such as minimum wage requirements, overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements. Many of our employees are paid at rates which are influenced by changes in the federal and state wage regulations. Accordingly, changes in the wage regulations could increase our labor costs. The work conditions at our facilities are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and are subject to periodic inspections by this agency. In addition, the enactment of recent legislation and resulting new government regulation relating to healthcare benefits may result in additional cost increases and other effects in the future.
Gaming Regulations
 
We are also subject to regulations in Oregon where we operate gaming machines. Gaming operations are generally highly regulated and conducted under the permission and oversight of the state or local gaming commission, lottery or other government agencies.
Other Regulations
 
We are subject to a variety of consumer protection and similar laws and regulations at the federal, state and local level. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to financial and other penalties.
Seasonality
 
The sales of our restaurants may peak at various times throughout the year due to certain promotional events, weather and holiday related events. For example, our domestic fast casual restaurants tend to peak in the Spring, Summer and Fall months when the weather is milder. Quarterly results also may be affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores. For these reasons, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 281 employees, including 3 in the United Kingdom, and 278 in the United States. We employ additional people on a part-time basis as needed.
Working Capital Practices
 
Historically, we have financed our operations through public and private sales of common stock, issuance of preferred and common stock, convertible debt instruments, term loans and credit lines from financial institutions, and cash generated from operations. On March 27, 2020, Congress passed “The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act” (CARES Act), which included the “Paycheck Protection Program” (PPP) for small businesses. On April 27, 2020, Amergent received a PPP loan in the amount of $2.1 million. On February 25, 2021, the Company received a second PPP loan of $2.0 million. These PPP loans may be forgiven if certain criteria are met.
