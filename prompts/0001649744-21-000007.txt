ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the “Company,” “Duluth,” “Duluth Trading,” “Duluth Holdings,” “Duluth Trading Co.,” “we,” “our” or “us” are used to refer to Duluth Holdings Inc.
The following discussion contains references to fiscal years 2020 and 2019, which refer to our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and February 2, 2020, respectively. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were 52-week periods.
Duluth Trading is a lifestyle brand of men’s and women’s casual wear, workwear and accessories primarily sold through our own omnichannel platform. We offer products nationwide through our website and catalog. In 2010, we initiated our omnichannel platform with the opening of our first store. Since then, we have expanded our retail presence, and as of January 31, 2021, we operated 62 retail stores and three outlet stores. In fiscal 2020, we opened a total of 4 retail stores adding approximately 60,000 gross square feet to our stores.
Duluth Trading was founded in 1989 when two brothers in the home construction industry were tired of dragging tools from job to job using discarded five-gallon drywall compound buckets. The two brothers were never satisfied with the status quo and believed “there’s gotta be a better way.” So, they invented the Bucket Boss® - a ruggedly durable canvas tool organizer that fits around a drywall bucket and transformed the way construction workers organized their tools. Capitalizing on their initial success, these brothers launched a catalog that later became known as Duluth Trading Company. Under the initial philosophy of “Job Tough, Job Smart,” this catalog was dedicated to improving and expanding on existing methods of tool storage, organization and transport. In December 2000, GEMPLER’S Inc., a Wisconsin corporation and an agricultural and horticultural supply catalog business founded and owned by Stephen L. Schlecht, acquired Duluth Trading and brought the two mail order companies together. Both catalogs had customers who worked outside and embraced the spirit of hands-on, self-reliant Americans. In February 2003, the GEMPLER’s catalog business was sold to W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW) and proceeds from that sale were used to fund the growth of Duluth Trading. With that transaction, GEMPLER’S changed its corporate name to Duluth Holdings Inc.
From what began as an idea aimed at those working in the building trades, Duluth Trading has become a widely recognized brand and proprietary line of innovative and functional apparel and gear. We have created strong brand awareness, built a loyal customer base and generated robust sales momentum. We believe the foundation of our success is our culture of “poking average in the eye” by seeing things for what they could be and should be and finding a way to make them exactly that, and we like to do it all with a big, toothy grin.
Our Growth Strategies
Our goal is to expand the reach of the Duluth Trading brand, using strategies that will further drive growth and profitability:
Evolving into a Portfolio of Distinct Brands within the Duluth Trading Co. Ecosystem. At the center of Duluth Trading Co’s success has been the consistent ability to develop and grow our brands and sub-brands. We’ve used our unique combination of forward-thinking product development, memorable storytelling and direct relationship with the customer to evolve and grow the Duluth Trading Men’s sub-brand. We used the same formula on the Duluth Trading Women’s sub-brand and, more recently, the Alaskan Hardgear sub-brand. This continued success gives us the confidence to enter the next phase of our evolution: Duluth Trading Co. as a direct to consumer brand platform. We plan to leverage our infrastructure investments and direct marketing expertise to launch and grow closely guarded digitally native brands that cater to an ever-growing definition of a “can-do” customer. Men and Women across all walks of life can rely on Duluth Trading Co. portfolio of brands for quality, innovative products to support hands-on work, active hobbies and modern, self-reliant lifestyle. 40Grit and Best Made are our latest platform sub-brands. 40Grit is a workwear basics line tailored to our younger, more budget conscious consumer. Best Made is a premium offering with design-focused hardgoods and apparel. Over time, we will plan to add more sub-brands as we see whitespace or as acquisition opportunities emerge.
Growing Sales in Existing Store and Non-Store Markets. Based on our experience to date, we believe the combination of our high brand awareness and agile digital advertising tools allow us to grow our business in both store markets and non-store markets, while also navigating through the unprecedented disruptions to store traffic that the COVID-19 pandemic brought on. Our significant shift between physical and digital channel sales in 2020, yet realizing growth in sales overall for the year, highlight the flexibility and resiliency of our direct order fulfillment model. Once we begin to return to normal retail operations, one of our top priorities will be to drive awareness of and traffic to our stores with total market growth being our primary goal. 

 


We believe our retail stores provide ancillary marketing benefits by complementing our digital presence to enable brand discovery, experience and superior service. We believe that our customers’ desire to shop in stores, combined with the compelling unit economics of our existing retail stores, provide us with the opportunity to continue to grow our store market sales, but to be selective on new store formats and locations based on changing shopping behavior. We plan to scale our distribution model to meet customer’s expectations across brands in a cost-effective manner. We will also plan to develop strategic partnerships to extend the reach of our brands into new channels or to provide unique product offerings.
Strengthening the Core Men’s Duluth Brand. We believe there is opportunity to fortify and grow our men’s business by selectively broadening our assortment in certain product categories that cement Duluth as the most innovative workwear destination. Our Duluth Trading Men’s sub-brand will remain focused on our long-standing key to success by introducing products that solve a problem and serve a purpose. Our Duluth Trading Men’s collection of workwear apparel and accessories includes our most well-known base layer and underwear category, where we will continue to develop innovative products in our Center for Underwear Advancement initiative.
Growing Our Women’s Duluth Brand. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our Duluth Trading Women’s sub-brand through customer acquisition, and we plan to leverage all of our marketing tools to do so. We expect that our Duluth Trading Women’s sub-brand will continue to represent an increasing portion of our net sales, and accordingly, we are allocating a higher percentage of our total advertising budget to the women’s sub-brand. With our Duluth Women’s Brand relaunch in 2020, our focus shifted to hands-on capable women through our WAYFORGER™ customer features and Maker’s Collection of workwear. Also, our expansion of base layer basics featuring a broadened assortment of sizes and unique fabrications establish Duluth as the Destination for Comfort. We believe that as we continue to capture share in an increasingly fragmented women’s apparel market, our business will continue to grow and be driven by solution-based products that fits the Modern, Self-Reliant American Lifestyle and will appeal to a wider range of female customers.
Omnichannel
Our omnichannel business strategy allows our sales channels to work in synergy to seamlessly deliver a consistent brand experience to the customer, including consistent marketing, pricing and product presentation. All sales channels are fully integrated, including stores, website, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our omnichannel services include order-in-store, buy-online-pickup-in-store, and ship-from-store as well as retail store and mobile shopping experiences.
Retail Store Environment
Our retail stores are designed to bring our brand to life by creating a unique and entertaining experience, including engaging sales associates, a compelling and complete product assortment, custom made fixtures to fit our brand, free wireless Internet and complimentary coffee and water. We also showcase unique attractions at each retail store that celebrate the heritage of the local area, such as the tool museum in our Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin store and the “Exploded Tractor” exhibit in our Ankeny, Iowa store. We believe these local community elements help promote customer loyalty and drive repeat purchases.
Our Products
We offer a comprehensive line of innovative, durable and functional casual wear, workwear and accessories for both men and women. Our product assortment includes shirts, pants, underwear, outerwear, footwear, accessories and hard goods. Our products feature proprietary designs and distinct names, such as our Longtail T® shirts, Buck NakedTM underwear, Fire Hose® work pants and No-YankTM Tank. 
Our stable product assortment appeals to our customers for their everyday and on-the-job use. The majority of our products represent enduring styles that go beyond short-lived fashion trends. We believe many of our customers’ purchases are driven by our thoughtful design and high quality craftsmanship, and our best-selling styles tend to be items that carry over year to year with only minor updates. 
We believe the authenticity of our products is driven by a number of factors, including our solution-based design process, use of technical materials, sophisticated manufacturing methods and innovative product features. Our products are sold at competitive prices and are designed to offer superior performance with added features such as underarm panels for more freedom of movement, triple-stitched seams for durability and mid-leg utility pockets for functionality. We also collaborate with our suppliers to develop advanced fabrics that we sell under our trademarks. For example, we incorporate our Duluthflex® Fire Hose® cotton canvas into products to provide strength and abrasion resistance with stretch for freedom of movement.

Product Development
We are focused on developing apparel and gear that builds upon the Duluth Trading brand’s product heritage of “there’s gotta be a better way,” resulting in distinctive products with enhanced features. We primarily use an innovative feedback-based design process through which we actively seek the input of our customers, including a group of more than 100 products testers with expertise in the trades industry. These trades panel members have become an integral part of our product development process, as they test and evaluate select products in intense conditions, providing real-time feedback on performance and functionality. Members of our product development team also regularly read online customer product reviews, attend tradeshows and collaborate with our vendors, which facilitates new product innovation. Our product development team incorporates all of this input to develop new product solutions and features, ensure consistent fit, style and color and design functional and durable fabrics.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy is designed to build brand awareness, acquire new customers, enhance customer loyalty and drive sales transactions. We are nationally known for our creative, irreverent and quirky advertising that features our Giant Angry Beaver, Buck Naked Guy and Grab-Happy Grizzly characters to showcase our brand philosophy, humor and innovation. We also feature testimonials in our marketing campaigns, which put our products in context, tying them to the individuals who represent our core customer, who leads a hands-on lifestyle, values a job well-done and is often outdoors for work and hobbies. We believe our customers identify with the inspiring stories of real men and women, recognize our products’ versatility and appreciate the extreme and demanding conditions our products can withstand.
We pursue our marketing strategy through multiple forms of media, which gives our products an identity and enhances our brand:
Digital and Email Marketing. We employ a variety of digital and online advertising strategies. These efforts include display advertising, digital video advertising, search engine marketing and optimization and targeted email, which we send to customers to introduce new products and offer promotions on select merchandise.
Television. We advertise on cable and broadcast television networks to build brand awareness for both men’s and women’s products and to reach a large, national audience. These advertisements feature both our animated characters and female models, and are intended to be humorous, irreverent and quirky in order to grab the viewer’s attention, while highlighting the particularly innovative, solution-based features of our core products and the Duluth Trading name.
Social Media. We have an engaged social media community, which allows us to personally connect with our customers online, and we believe further raises brand awareness. We maintain a social media presence on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Twitter.
Catalogs. Our catalogs are an important part of our heritage and represent a tangible vehicle for our authentic and humorous storytelling. Our catalogs serve as an important customer acquisition tool by driving visits to our website and retail stores.
Customer Service
We are committed to providing outstanding customer service and believe in treating our customers like next-door neighbors. Our retail stores are stocked with a comprehensive assortment of our products and staffed with knowledgeable and well trained sales associates. We stand behind all purchases with our “No Bull Guarantee.” Our call center is open for calls from 5 A.M. to 1 A.M. Central Time, seven days a week and is staffed with friendly, knowledgeable representatives dedicated to making every customer experience positive. As a convenience to our customers, we offer live chat through our website, which is available from 7 A.M. to 8 P.M. Central Time on weekdays and 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. Central Time on weekends.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead, we arrange with third-party vendors for the manufacturing of our merchandise. We have built strong, long-term relationships with our vendors. In fiscal 2020, 60% of our purchases came from our largest supplier, an agent partner in Hong Kong who manages multiple factories across Asia, including Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Approximately 10% of our purchases in fiscal 2020 came from our second largest supplier, which is based in Thailand. We believe sourcing inventory through these agents allows us to leverage the agents’ purchasing power with multiple factories, as well as transportation and logistics capabilities, allowing our internal team to focus on our core competencies of product development, storytelling and serving customers, rather than factory and mill management or logistics.

 


Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and employing vendors that provide quality materials and fine craftsmanship that our customers expect of our brand. To ensure that our high standards of quality and timely delivery of merchandise are met, we work closely with our third-party agent partners. All of our products are produced according to our specifications, and we require all of our manufacturers to adhere to strict regulatory compliance and standards of conduct. We seek to ensure the consistent quality by employing Duluth Trading-certified factory auditors to selectively examine pre-production samples, conduct periodic site visits to certain of our vendors’ production facilities and inspect inbound shipments at our distribution centers.
Distribution Centers
We operate distribution centers located in Belleville, Wisconsin and Dubuque, Iowa. We plan to open a new distribution center before the peak holiday shopping season in Salt Lake City, Utah to further expand our shipping capacity and store replenishment capabilities. The approximate square footage of each facility is included in Item 2 of Part I of this report. We also contracted with two third-party logistics (“3PLs”) centers in Sparks, Nevada and Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Our contracts with the 3PLs ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Orders are generally assigned to the distribution center closest to the customer’s ship-to location.
Returns Center
We currently lease a warehouse space located in Verona, Wisconsin. The approximate square footage is included in Item 2 of Part I of this report. Our returns center handles the majority of direct-to-consumer sales returns.
Information Technology
We use technology to provide customer service, business process support and business intelligence across our sales channels. We continually aim to have more efficient supply chain and distribution systems operations. Our distributed order management systems provide us with omnichannel capabilities that have a global view of available-to-promise inventory management. 
Competition
We operate primarily in the apparel, footwear and accessories industry, which is highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer companies and retailers, including men’s and women’s specialty apparel chains, department stores, outdoor specialty stores, apparel catalog businesses and online apparel businesses. We compete principally on the basis of brand recognition, innovation, product quality, customer service and price. To stay ahead of our competition, we continue to develop innovative solution-based products for which we create unique selling propositions that incorporate humor and storytelling.
Intellectual Property
Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts. We own or have the rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, trademark offices in other jurisdictions, or exist under common law in the United States and other jurisdictions. The “Duluth Trading Co” trade name and trademark is used both in the United States and internationally and is material to our business. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services are Alaskan Hardgear®, Armachillo®, Ballroom®, Cab Commander®, Crouch Gusset®, Dry on the Fly®, Duluth Trading Co®, Duluthflex®, Fire Hose®, Longtail T®, No Polo Shirt®, No Yank® and Wild Boar Mocs®. Our rights to some of these trademarks may be limited to select markets. We also own domain names, including “duluthtrading.com.”
Employees
As of January 31, 2021, we employed 1,030 full-time and 1,947 part-time and flexible part-time employees, 1,630 of which were employed at our retail stores. The number of employees, particularly part-time employees, fluctuates depending upon seasonal needs. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
‎

Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations. Our net sales and net income are generally highest in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday sales period. The following table presents net sales and net income for the fourth quarter as a percentage of the fiscal year.

Available Information
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are made available free of charge on or through our website at www.duluthtrading.com under the “Investors” tab as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with, or furnished to the SEC. 
Additional Information
In March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. This pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, led to significant travel and transportation restrictions, including mandatory business closures and orders to shelter in place. The Company has focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and suppliers, working with our customers, landlords, suppliers and vendors to minimize potential disruptions and supporting our community, while managing our business in these unprecedented times. All retail stores were temporarily closed beginning March 20, 2020 and began re-opening the first week of May through the third week of June. All of our retail stores are open, but prolonged COVID-19 safety concerns have kept store traffic at subdued levels.
The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance still depends on future developments outside of our control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by federal, state and local government officials, international governments to prevent disease spread, and the availability, safety and efficiency of a vaccine. We continue to actively evaluate all federal, state and local regulations to ensure compliance with store operations.
