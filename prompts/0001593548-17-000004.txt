ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, or unless specifically stated otherwise, references to the “Company”, “AP Gaming”, “AGS”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to AP Gaming Holdco Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a Delaware corporation that was formed in August 2013 to acquire, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, 100% of the equity in AGS Capital, LLC (“AGS Capital”) from AGS Holdings, LLC (“AGS Holdings”). AGS Capital was a supplier of EGMs (defined below), primarily to Class II Native American gaming jurisdictions.
We are a designer and supplier of diverse products and services for the gaming industry.  Founded in 2005, our roots are in the Class II Native American gaming market, where we are one of the market leaders in electronic gaming machines (“EGMs”), which include slot machines, video bingo machines, and other electronic gaming devices. Our customers predominantly consist of casino operators in Class II and Class III Native American and commercial gaming enterprises.  We generate over 90% of our total revenue from lease agreements whereby we place EGMs, systems, and table game products at a customer’s facility in return for either a share of the revenues that these products generate, or a daily or monthly fee and from Interactive gaming operations revenue.  Over the past 18 months, we have significantly broadened and diversified our product portfolio through both organic development and strategic acquisitions, and we now offer three distinct categories of products: Electronic Gaming Machines (“EGM”), Table products (“Table Products”), and Interactive Social Casino Games (“Interactive”). Each segment's activities include the design, development, acquisition, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, installation and servicing of a distinct product line.

Apollo had assets under management of approximately $192 billion as of December 31, 2016 in private equity, credit and real estate funds invested across a core group of nine industries where Apollo has considerable knowledge and resources. Apollo has a successful track record of managing investments on behalf of its affiliated funds, such as Great Wolf Resorts, Diamond Resorts, Outerwall, CEC Entertainment, Norwegian Cruise Lines, ADT and McGraw Hill Education.
Our Operations
Under our customer contracts, we provide customers with EGMs, table products, ancillary table product equipment, systems software, computer hardware, signage and other equipment for operation within their gaming facilities. In return we receive either a share of the revenue generated by these products and systems, a flat monthly fee, or a daily fee. The determination of whether our agreement results in a revenue share, monthly fee, or daily fee arrangement is generally governed by local gaming jurisdictions. For our revenue share arrangements on EGM products, we have historically shared between 15 and 20% of the revenues generated by the EGMs. Under our agreements for EGMs, we participate in selecting the mix of titles, maintain and service the equipment and oversee certain promotional efforts. For licensed table products and related equipment, we typically receive monthly royalty payments. Currently, Interactive revenue is generated from consumers’ purchases of virtual coins which are used to play the games. In support of our business and operations, we employ a professional staff including field service technicians, production, sales, account management, marketing, technology and game development, licensing and compliance and finance.

Our corporate headquarters are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, which serves as the primarily location for the executive management and administrative functions such as finance, legal, licensing and compliance. Our licensing and compliance division oversees the application and renewal of our corporate gaming licenses, findings of suitability for key officers and directors and certification of our gaming equipment and systems for specific jurisdictions, human resources, as well as coordinating gaming equipment and software shipping and on-site and remote service of our equipment with gaming authorities.
Our field service technicians are responsible for installing, maintaining and servicing our gaming products and systems. Our field service operation including our call center, which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is managed out of our Oklahoma facility. We can also access most of our electronic gaming machines and systems remotely from approved remote locations to provide software updates and routine maintenance. In addition, our electronic gaming machine and system production facilities are located in and managed out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Atlanta, Georgia, and Mexico City, D.F.. Our table product service is primarily managed from Las Vegas, Nevada.
Sales, product management and account management are managed through our various locations and are located throughout the jurisdictions in which we do business. Sales and account management oversee the customer relationship both at the individual location and corporate level and are responsible for developing new customer relationships. Account management is in charge of running on-site promotions and corporate sponsorship programs. In addition, our marketing team is in charge of general corporate marketing, including advertisements and participation at industry trade shows.
Our technology and game development division operates primarily out of our Atlanta, Georgia location and to a lesser extent in Las Vegas, Nevada and Austin, Texas. Through the acquisition of Gamingo Limited (formerly known as “RocketPlay”, currently known as “AGSi”), we have a development team in Tel Aviv, Israel as well. We employ game developers, software and system programmers, project managers and other development and administrative staff that oversee our internal game development efforts and manage third party relationships.
Products

We provide our casino customers with high-performing Class II and Class III EGMs for the Tribal and commercial gaming markets, approximately 25 unique table product offerings, ancillary table product equipment, systems software, computer hardware, signage and other equipment for operation within their gaming facilities. We also offer a vast library of casino-themed social and mobile games as well as business to business social casino products available to land-based casino customers. 

Electronic Gaming Machines. From captivating games to engaging play mechanics, AGS creates industry leading EGMs for the global marketplace, which currently includes the United States and Latin America. We provide a continually growing library of exciting game titles offered on several state-of the-art cabinets equipped with competitive hardware. Our game library includes nearly 300 titles offered on various cabinets, including ICON, Orion, and Big RedTM. In addition to providing complete EGM units, we also offer conversion kits that allow customers to update existing game titles to meet the demands of their customers.

Operating Platforms
We have strategically shifted our focus to create new internal content and leverage our Atlas operating platform as a conduit for our current and future products. Currently, our ICON and Orion cabinets run on the Atlas operating platform. We will continue porting our legacy games onto the Atlas platform, enhancing both our Class II and III offerings. We expect internally-generated content to be a larger source of our installed base going forward. 
Cabinets
We design cabinets for comfort, functionality and serviceability. From our premium cabinet Orion to our core cabinet ICON to our specialty cabinet Big Red (Colossal Diamonds), we design cabinets for every category to capture the attention of players on casino floors while aiming to maximize operator profits. 
Gaming Machine Titles
Across our 300+ EGM game library is a mix of recent successes, including Golden Wins, Jade Wins, Buffalo Jackpots, Longhorn Jackpots, Colossal Diamonds and Fu Nan Fu Nu, as well as legacy titles with long-lasting playability that continue to appeal to players across the county - like Royal Reels and the So Hot family of games. We strategically focus our 
4

development efforts on creating games that appeal to the core gambler and have more than 50 new titles planned for release in 2017. 
Table Products. Our table products include live proprietary table games and side bets, as well as ancillary table game products. Products include both internally developed and acquired proprietary table games, side bets, and table technology related to blackjack, poker, baccarat, craps and roulette. We have acquired a number of popular brands, including In-Bet, Buster Blackjack, and Criss Cross Poker that are based on traditional well-known public domain games such as blackjack and poker; however, these proprietary games provide intriguing betting options that offer more excitement and greater volatility to the player, ultimately enhancing our casino customers’ profitability. Our Bonus Spin product is unique in that it allows players to make a progressive wager that when won, allows them to spin a virtual wheel at the table for cash or experience based prizes after winning on an initial wager. We believe this bonusing platform provides operators with a unique and simple way to enhance traditional felt games and to appeal to their table games players without altering the base game play on which the initial wager is placed. In September 2015, we announced the acquisition of critical card shuffler intellectual property and technology. The Dex-S is a single deck, commercial-grade shuffler featuring a streamlined design with few moving parts, making it exceptionally functional and economical. 
Interactive. Our social gaming products are primarily delivered through our mobile apps, Lucky Play Casino, Wild Vegas Casino, Buffalo Jackpot Casino, and Vegas Fever.   The apps contain several game titles available for consumers to play for free and with chips that they purchase through the app.  Some of our most popular social games include content that is also popular in land-based settings such as Fire Wolf, Gold Dragon Red Dragon, Legend of the White Buffalo, Royal Reels, Colossal Diamonds, So Hot, and Monkey in the Bank. The social design of our games is at the core of how players experience its games. Our games encourage players to quickly connect with their friends when they start a game and to build and enhance these relationships throughout the game experience. We also have two distinct business to business (defined below) social casino products available to land-based casino customers. The first option is PlayCasino, a white label version of Lucky Play Casino that contains all of the same EGM games and other supporting social game features branded with the casino customer’s brand and style. The second option is PlayRGS, a Remote Gaming Server (“RGS”) specifically used to provide AGS EGM game content to casino customers that are using an existing social casino solution be it their own or that of a third party. 
Other Segment Information
Customers and marketing. We market our products to casinos and other legal gaming establishments around the world with our domestic and international sales force and several domestic and international distributors and/or representatives. We believe the quality and breadth of our customer base is a strong testament to the effectiveness and quality of our product offerings, technological innovation and customer service. Our customer base includes leading casino operators in leading established gaming markets such as the United States, Canada and Latin America. Our customers include, among others, Caesar’s Entertainment Corp., MGM Resorts International, Poarch Creek Band of Indians, and the Chickasaw Nation.
Our products and the locations in which we may sell them are subject to the licensing and product approval requirements of various national, state, provincial and tribal jurisdictional agencies that regulate gaming around the world.  See “Regulation and Licensing” section below.  We lease and sell our products, with an emphasis on leasing versus selling, primarily in the United States. We service the products we lease and offer service packages to customers who purchase products from us.
Product supply. We obtain most of the parts for our products from outside suppliers, including both off-the-shelf items as well as components manufactured to our specifications. We also manufacture parts in-house that are used for product assembly and for servicing existing products. We generally perform warehousing, quality control, final assembly and shipping from our facilities in Las Vegas, Atlanta, Mexico City and Oklahoma City, although small inventories are maintained and repairs are performed by our field service employees. We believe that our sources of supply for components and raw materials are adequate and that alternative sources of materials are available.
Manufacturing
We have manufacturing agreements to build our gaming cabinets with multiple manufacturing vendors. We believe we have limited concentration risk with any one of these vendors, since we own the rights to our cabinet designs and thus have the ability to change manufacturers in the event of a dispute. We believe any of these vendors would be able to build our gaming cabinets for titles on any platform. As the supplier base is large, we are able to gain competitive pricing and delivery on any of our cabinets and have limited risk in supply disruptions.

Our primary electronic gaming machine production facility is located in and managed out of Oklahoma. Production at this facility includes assembling and refurbishing gaming machines (excluding gaming cabinets), parts support and purchasing. We also assemble electronic gaming machines at our Las Vegas, Nevada and Mexico City, D.F. facilities at lower volumes to support the Nevada, California and Mexico markets, respectively.  System production is housed at our Atlanta, Georgia office, which house our system design team and our research and development team.  Field service technicians are located in various jurisdictions throughout the United States and Mexico and are dispatched from centralized call centers. They are responsible for installing, maintaining and servicing the electronic gaming machines and systems.
Manufacturing commitments are generally based on projected quarterly orders from customers. Due to uneven order flow from customers, we bring the cabinets in with minimal components so that we can delay the cash outlay for the most costly components until closer to the point of sale.
Customers
We believe the quality and breadth of our customer base is a strong testament to the effectiveness and quality of our product offerings, technological innovation and customer service. At the core of our relationship with our customers is our participation model, which aligns our financial incentives with those of our customers through a shared dependence on the games’ performance. The combination of our customer-aligned participation model, quality customer service and strong game performance has allowed us to develop long-term relationships with our tribal and commercial casino customers. Our top participation customers have been with us for nearly a decade, and we believe that we maintain long-term relationships with key customer decision-makers.
Oklahoma is our largest market and our electronic gaming machines in the state accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our largest customer is the Chickasaw Nation, a Native American gaming operator in Oklahoma, which accounted for approximately 15% of our gaming operations revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The revenues we earn from the Chickasaw Nation are derived from numerous agreements, which are scheduled to expire in 2019. We have historically offered select existing and prospective customers an upfront payment, or placement fee, in exchange for exclusive rights to a percentage of their floor space. To a lesser extent, we have offered financing for casino development and expansion projects. In addition to our long-term relationships and contractual arrangements, the consistent demand for our titles from the loyal, repeat players of our titles further ensures our strong presence on our customers’ casino floors.
The Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a Native American gaming operator in Alabama, accounted for approximately 10% of our gaming operations revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Within the Native American market, we provide both Class II and Class III games. We also serve customers in commercial, video lottery terminal, charity bingo and route-based markets.
Customer Contracts
We derive the majority of our gaming revenues from participation agreements, whereby we place electronic gaming machines and systems, along with our proprietary and other licensed game content, at a customer’s facility in return for either a share of the revenues that these electronic gaming machines and systems generate or a daily fee. For licensed table products and related equipment, we typically receive monthly royalty payments. We measure the performance of our domestic installed base of participation electronic gaming machines on the net win per day per machine, often referred to as the win per day, or “WPD”. Under our participation agreements, we earn a percentage of the WPD of our domestic installed base of participation electronic gaming machines. 
Our standard contracts are one to three years in duration and may contain auto-renewal provisions for an additional term. Our contracts generally specify the number of electronic gaming machines and other equipment to be provided, revenue share, daily fee or other pricing, provisions regarding installation, training, service and removal of the machines, and other terms and conditions standard in the industry. In some circumstances, we enter into trial agreements with customers that provide a free or fee-based trial period, during which such customers may use our electronic gaming machines or table product. Each trial agreement lays out the terms of payment should the customer decide to continue using our machines.
Our placement fee, development or similar agreements in the Native American and other markets have involved both a loan or advance of funds and a gaming equipment lease agreement. These agreements have typically been longer term contracts, ranging from four to ten years depending on the amount of financing provided, market and other factors. These contracts specified the amount and timing of the advances that we will be provided, the uses of those funds and target timing 
6

for the construction or remodeling of the gaming facility, if applicable. In addition, the contracts specified the repayment terms of the financing which vary by customer and agreement. Typical terms contained in these agreements included the percentage of the floor, minimum number of gaming machines, or percentage of the route operation allocated to us, the associated term or period of exclusivity for that allocation or number of gaming machines, minimum game performance thresholds, cure periods and resulting obligations, if any, and other general terms and conditions. Certain of these development agreements also contained a buyout option, which provides that upon written notice and payment of a buyout fee, the customer can terminate our floor space privileges.
We generally make efforts to obtain waivers of sovereign immunity in our contracts with Native American customers. However, we do not always obtain these provisions and when we do, they can be limited in scope. There is no guarantee that we will continue or improve our ability to get this term in future contracts. While we have not had any experience with contract enforceability vis-à-vis our Native American customers, we are cognizant of recent cases involving other parties dealing with waivers of sovereign immunity. Those cases put into question how sovereign immunity may be viewed by courts in the future. In the event that we enter into contracts with Native American customers in the future that do not contain a waiver of sovereign immunity, such contracts may be practically unenforceable.
Our game sale contracts are typical of those in the industry. They specify the general terms and conditions of the sale, equipment and services to be provided, as well as pricing and payment terms. In some cases, we provide the central server that is used to operate the purchased equipment on a lease and charge a fee per day based on the number of gaming machines connected to the server.
Our interactive social gaming revenue is generated from a high volume of consumers’ purchases of virtual coins which are used to play the games.
Research and Development
We conduct research and development through an internal team to develop new gaming systems and gaming content. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits, travel and expenses and other professional services. We employ approximately 160 game developers, software and system programmers, project managers and other development and administrative staff that oversee internal game development efforts and manage third party relationships. The technology and game development division operates primarily out of our Atlanta, Georgia location as well as in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Competition

We encounter competition from other designers, manufacturers and operators of electronic gaming machines, table products and social casino games. Our competitors range from small, localized companies to large, multi-national corporations, several of which have substantial resources and market share.
Our competitors for the live casino floor gaming machines include, but are not limited to, International Game Technology PLC (“IGT”), Scientific Games Corporation (“Scientific Games”), Aristocrat Technologies Inc. (“Aristocrat”), Everi Holdings Inc. (“Everi”), Konami Co. Ltd. (“Konami”), Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd., and Galaxy Gaming, Inc. Additionally, there are hundreds of non-gaming companies that design and develop social casino games and apps. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources and have been engaged in the design, manufacture and operation of gaming products for many years. Some of these companies contain significant intellectual property including patents in gaming technology and hardware design, systems and game play and trademarks. In addition, the larger competitors contain significantly larger content portfolios and content development capability and resources, are licensed in markets throughout the United States, and have international distribution. Scientific Games, IGT, Konami, and Aristocrat all have a presence in the back-office accounting and player tracking business which expands their relationship with casino customers. Everi and Aristocrat are our primary competitors in the Class II market.
To compete effectively, we must, among other things, continue to develop high-performing, innovative games for the Class II and Class III markets, provide excellent service and support to our existing customers, effectively manage our installed base of participation gaming machines, expand our library of proprietary content, develop niche products with strong appeal to both local and next-generation players, be first to market in new non-traditional markets, implement effective marketing and sales functions, and offer competitive pricing and terms on our participation and sale agreements.

Intellectual Property
We use a combination of internally developed and third-party intellectual property, all of which we believe maintain and enhance our competitive position and protect our products. Such intellectual property includes owned or licensed patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trademark applications in the United States. In addition, we have rights in intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, pursuant to our license agreements with third-party game developers, we license and distribute gaming software.
Seasonality
We may experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from quarter to quarter, however, we do not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality.
Inflation
Our operations have not been, nor are they expected to be in the future, materially affected by inflation. However, our operational expansion is affected by the cost of hardware components, which are not considered to be inflation sensitive, but rather, sensitive to changes in technology and competition in the hardware markets. In addition, we expect to continue to incur increased legal and other similar costs associated with regulatory compliance requirements and the uncertainties present in the operating environment in which we conduct our business.
Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had over 500 full-time equivalent employees, with approximately 120 employed internationally and approximately 400 employed domestically. 

We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements in the United States and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in the past.
Regulation and Licensing
We operate in numerous gaming jurisdictions, and our business operations, which include the manufacture, sale, and distribution, of gaming devices and gaming related equipment and/or the provision of gaming related services, are subject to extensive federal, state, local, tribal and foreign government regulation as applicable in each of the gaming jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant portion of our operations take place at facilities conducting gaming activities on the tribal lands of Native American tribes resulting in our operations being subject to tribal and/or federal and sometimes state regulation depending on the classification of gaming being conducted in each such case as defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or “IGRA”. In states where commercial gaming has been legalized, our operations are conducted subject to the applicable federal, state, and local government regulation.
While the specific regulatory requirements of the various jurisdictions vary, most require licenses, permits, findings of suitability and financial ability, and other forms of approval for our operational entities and, in some jurisdictions, the entities or individuals who hold some level of beneficial interest in the Company or its affiliates as well our lenders and other individuals or entities affiliated with us (contractually or otherwise). Our officers, directors, managers and key employees who are actively engaged in the administration or supervision of our gaming related operations may also be required to file for licensure, findings of suitability or other approvals. Regulators may determine such a person is unsuitable to participate in the gaming industry in such jurisdiction, and could require us to limit, suspend, or terminate or our relationship with such a person. In addition, many jurisdictions require our products to be tested for compliance with the jurisdiction’s technical standards and regulations prior to our being permitted to distribute our products. The various jurisdictions’ gaming regulators typically have broad power over our business operations and may deny, revoke, suspend, condition, limit, or not renew our gaming or other licenses, permits or approvals, impose substantial fines and take other action, any one of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. We believe we and our officers, directors, managers, key employees and affiliates have obtained all required gaming related licenses, permits, findings of suitability and other forms of approvals necessary to carry on our business. 
It is common for gaming regulators to monitor, or to require us to disclose, our activities and any disciplinary action against us in other gaming jurisdictions. Consequently, the business activities or disciplinary action taken against us in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. 
8

In most jurisdictions, even once licensed or approved, we remain under the on-going obligation to provide financial information and reports as well as to keep the applicable gaming regulators informed of any material changes in the information provided to regulators as part of the licensing and approval process. All licenses and approvals must be periodically renewed, in some cases as often as annually. In connection with any initial application or renewal of a gaming license or approval, we (and individuals or entities required to submit to background review or licensure in connection with our application or renewal) are typically required to make broad and comprehensive disclosures concerning our history, finances, ownership and corporate structure, operations, compliance controls and business relationships. We must regularly report changes in our officers, key employees and other licensed positions to applicable gaming regulators. 
Certain gaming jurisdictions in which we are licensed may prohibit us from making a public offering of our securities without their prior approval. Similarly, changes in control of a licensee through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets or stock, management or any form of takeover typically cannot occur without the prior approval of applicable gaming regulators. Such regulators may also require controlling beneficial owners, managers, officers, directors, and other persons or entities having a material relationship or involvement with the person proposing to acquire control, to be investigated, and licensed, found suitable or otherwise approved as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
Gaming regulators often have the power to investigate the holders of our debt or equity securities. If any holder of our debt or equity securities is found unsuitable by any gaming regulator in a jurisdiction in which we conduct business, our licensure or approval to conduct business in such jurisdiction could be subject to non-renewal, suspension or revocation.
Most gaming jurisdictions impose fees and taxes that are payable by us in connection with our application, maintenance and renewal of our licensure or our approval to conduct business. Laws, regulations, and ordinances governing our gaming related activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change that could impose additional operating, financial, or other burdens on the our business.
Federal Registration
The Gambling Devices Act of 1962 makes it unlawful for a person to manufacture, transport, or receive gaming devices, or components across interstate lines unless that person has first registered with the Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice. This act also imposes gambling device identification and record keeping requirements. Violation of this act may result in seizure and forfeiture of the equipment, as well as other penalties. As an entity involved in the manufacture and transportation of gaming devices, we are required to register annually.
Native American Gaming
The rules for Native American gaming were established in 1988 under the IGRA. Under the IGRA, gaming activities conducted by federally recognized Native American tribes are segmented into three classes of gaming activities:
Class I. Class I gaming represents traditional forms of Native American gaming as part of, or in connection with, tribal ceremonies or celebrations (e.g., contests and games of skill) and social gaming for minimal prizes. Class I gaming is regulated only by individual Native American tribes. We do not participate in any Class I gaming activities.
Class II. Class II gaming involves the game of chance commonly known as bingo (whether or not electronic, computer, or other technological aids are used in connection therewith to facilitate play) and if played in the same location as the bingo, also includes pull tabs, punch board, tip jars, instant bingo, and other games similar to bingo. Class II gaming also includes non-banked card games, that is, games that are played exclusively against other players rather than against the house or a player acting as a bank. However, the definition of Class II gaming specifically excludes slot machines or electronic facsimiles of Class III games. Class II gaming is regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission (the “NIGC”) and the laws of the Native American tribe conducting such gaming. Subject to the detailed requirements of the IGRA, including NIGC approval of such Native American tribe’s gaming ordinance, federally recognized Native American tribes are typically permitted to conduct Class II gaming on Indian lands pursuant to tribal ordinances approved by the NIGC.
Class III. Class III gaming includes all other forms of gaming that are neither Class I nor Class II and includes a broad range of traditional casino games such as slot machines, blackjack, craps and roulette, as well as wagering games and electronic facsimiles of any game of chance. The IGRA generally permits a Native American tribe to conduct Class III gaming activities on reservation lands subject to the detailed requirements of the IGRA and the entering into of a compact between such Native American tribe and the state in which the Native American tribe intends to conduct Class III gaming activities on its trust lands.
9

The IGRA is administered by the NIGC and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The NIGC has authority to issue regulations related to tribal gaming activities, approve tribal ordinances for regulating gaming, approve management agreements for gaming facilities, conduct investigations and monitor tribal gaming generally. The IGRA is subject to interpretation by the NIGC and may be subject to judicial and legislative clarification or amendment. The gaming ordinance of each Native American tribe conducting gaming under the IGRA and the terms of any applicable tribal/state compact establish the regulatory requirements under which we must conduct business on Native American tribal lands.
Under the IGRA, the NIGC’s authority to approve gaming-related contracts is limited to management contracts and collateral agreements related to management contracts. A “management contract” includes any agreement between a Native American tribe and a contractor if such contract or agreement provides for the management of all or part of a gaming operation. To the extent that any of our agreements with Native American tribes are deemed to be management contracts, such agreements would require the approval of the NIGC in order to be valid. To our knowledge, none of our current agreements with Native American tribes qualify as management contracts under the IGRA.
In addition, to the extent that any of our agreements with Native American tribes are deemed by the NIGC to create an impermissible proprietary interest, such agreements are void and unenforceable. To our knowledge, none of our current agreements with Native American tribes create an impermissible proprietary interest in Indian gaming.
International Regulation
Certain foreign countries permit the importation, sale, and operation of gaming equipment in casino and non-casino environments. Some countries prohibit or restrict the payout feature of the traditional slot machine or limit the operation and the number of slot machines to a controlled number of casinos or casino-like locations. Gaming equipment must comply with the individual country’s regulations. Certain jurisdictions do not require the licensing of gaming equipment operators and manufacturers.
