ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Background
 
We were incorporated in Colorado on January 16, 2002. In April 2012, we became active in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties.
 
Effective September 2, 2016, we formally changed our name to Petrolia Energy Corporation and moved the corporation from Colorado to Texas, pursuant to the filing of a Statement of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Colorado and a Certificate of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Texas, authorized by the Plan of Conversion which was approved by our stockholders at our April 14, 2016, annual meeting of stockholders, each of which are described in greater detail in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2016. In addition to the Certificate of Conversion filing, we filed a Certificate of Correction filing with the Secretary of State of Texas (correcting certain errors in our originally filed Certificate of Formation) on August 24, 2016.
Plan of Operation
 
Since 2015, we have established a clearly defined strategy to acquire, enhance and redevelop high-quality, resource in place oil and gas assets. The Company has been focusing on producing assets in the United States and Canada while actively pursuing our strategy to offer low-cost operational solutions in established Oil and Gas regions. We believe our mix of oil-in-place conventional plays, low-risk resource plays and the redevelopment of our late-stage plays is a solid foundation for continued growth and future revenue growth.
Slick Unit Dutcher Sands (“SUDS”) Field
 
The SUDS oilfield consists of approximately 2,604 acres located in Creek County, Oklahoma and Petrolia owns a 100% Working Interest (“WI”) with a 76.5% net revenue interest (NRI). Our engineering reports and analysis indicate there is still considerable recoverable reserves remaining.
 
The SUDS field is currently shut-in while awaiting sufficient capital to recomplete the wells and repair the flow lines that were damaged in a grass fire.
 
Twin Lakes San Andres Unit (“TLSAU”) Field
 
TLSAU is located 45 miles from Roswell, Chaves County, New Mexico. TLSAU is currently shut-in awaiting confirmation of lease acreage held, then capital allocation to complete some regulatory plugging requirements. The Company plugged two wells at Twin Lakes in June 2022 and is currently working on surface remediation activities.
 
The Company is reviewing strategic options with the TLSAU asset, with a bias toward divesting the asset.
 
Askarii Resources, LLC
 
Effective February 1, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding interests of Askarii Resources LLC (“tax”), a private Texas based oil & gas service company for the aggregate value of $50,000. The Company currently has no intent of further investing in the Askarii Resources, LLC acquisition.
Luseland, Hearts Hill and Cuthbert fields
 
On June 29, 2018, the Company acquired a 25% working interest in approximately 41,526 acres in the Luseland, Hearts Hill, and Cuthbert fields, located in Southwest Saskatchewan and Eastern Alberta, Canada. The working interest was acquired from Blue Sky Resources (a related party). Blue Sky Resources had previously acquired an 80% working interest from Georox Resources Inc., who had acquired the Canadian Properties from Cona Resources Ltd.
 
On September 17, 2018, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Blue Sky Resources to obtain the rights to acquire an additional 3% working interest, increasing our working interest to 28%. Total consideration paid from the Company to Blue Sky Resources for the additional 3% Working Interest was $150,000.

On February 16, 2022, Petrolia Canada Corporation (PCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrolia Energy Corporation (PEC), entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) and Debt Settlement Agreement (DSA) with Prospera Energy, Inc. whereby PCC sold its 28% working interest in the Luseland, Hearts Hill and Cuthbert fields. The agreements were effective as of October 1, 2021.
 
Utikuma Lake field
 
On May 1, 2020, Petrolia Energy Corporation acquired a 50% working interest in approximately 28,000 acres located in the Utikuma Lake area in Alberta, Canada. The property is an oil-weighted asset currently producing a total of approximately 500 bpd of light oil. The working interest was acquired from Blue Sky Resources in an affiliated party transaction as Zel C. Khan, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, is related to the ownership of Blue Sky Resources.
 
Blue Sky Resources acquired a 100% working interest in the Canadian Property from Vermilion Energy Inc. via Vermilion’s subsidiary Vermilion Resources. The effective date of the acquisition was May 1, 2020. The total purchase price of the property was $2,000,000 (CAD), with $1,000,000 (CAD) of that total due initially. The additional $1,000,000 (CAD) was contingent on the future price of WTI crude. At the time WTI price exceeded $50/bbl, the Company would pay an additional $750,000 (CAD). In addition, at the time WTI price exceeded $57/bbl the Company would pay an additional $250,000 (CAD) (for a cumulative contingent total of $1,000,000 (CAD)). The price of WTI crude exceeded $50/bbl on January 6, 2021 and exceeded $57/bbl on February 8, 2021. The additional payments due were netted with the accounts receivable balance from previous Joint Interest Billing statements from BSR. The total USD value of the addition was $787,250, using prevailing exchange rates on the respective dates. Included in the terms of the agreement, the Company also funded their portion of the Alberta Energy Regulator (“AER”) bond fund requirement ($602,423 USD), necessary for the wells to continue in production after the acquisition. Additional funds ($386,989 USD) remain in the other current asset balance for future payments to BSR, related to the acquisition.
 
On June 13, 2022, a Letter Agreement was signed between Blue Sky Resources Ltd. (“BSR”) and Petrolia Energy Corporation whereby Petrolia Canada Corporation (“PCC”) will sell to BSR its 50% working interest in the Utikuma Lake oil field. See Form 8-K reference in Exhibits section below.

Leases on acres that are Held by Production remain in force so long as oil or gas is produced from one or more wells on the particular lease. Leased acres that are not held by Production require annual rental payments to maintain the lease until the first to occur of the following: the expiration of the lease or the time that oil or gas is produced from one or more wells drilled on the leased acreage. At the time oil or gas is produced from wells drilled on the leased acreage, the lease is considered to be Held by Production.

Below are estimates of our present value of estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves based upon the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is determined by using estimated quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on period-end economic conditions. The estimated future production is based upon benchmark prices that reflect the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day-of-the-month price for oil and gas during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. The resulting estimated future cash inflows are then reduced by estimated future costs to develop and produce reserves based on period-end cost levels. No deduction has been made for depletion, depreciation or for indirect costs, such as general corporate overhead. Present values were computed by discounting future net revenues by 10% per year.
 

Future cash inflows | $ | 93,082,624 | 
-------------------------------------------+---+-------------+--
Deductions (including estimated taxes) | $ | (47,760,263 | )
Future net cash flow | $ | 45,322,361 |

MKM Engineering prepared the estimates of our proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to our leasehold interests in the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2021. Michele Mudrone was the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve report. Ms. Mudrone has more than 25 years of practical experience in the estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves. MKM Engineering is an independent petroleum engineering firm that provides petroleum consulting services to the oil and gas industry. The estimates of drilled reserves, future production, and income attributable to certain leasehold and royalty interests are based on technical analysis conducted by engineers employed at MKM Engineering.
 
Mark Allen, our CEO, oversaw preparation of the reserve estimates by MKM Engineering. We do not have a reserve committee and we do not have any specific internal controls regarding the estimates of our reserves.
 
Our proved reserves include only those amounts which we reasonably expect to recover in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, at current prices and costs, under existing regulatory practices and with existing technology. Accordingly, any changes in prices, operating and development costs, regulations, technology, or other factors could significantly increase or decrease estimates of proved reserves.
 
Proved reserves were estimated by performance methods, the volumetric method, analogy, or a combination of methods utilizing present economic conditions and limited to those proved reserves economically recoverable. The performance methods include decline curve analysis that utilize extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through December 31, 2021, in those cases where such data was considered to be definitive.
 
Forecasts for future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production in the region with an economic cut-off for production based upon the projected net revenue being equal to the projected operating expenses. No further reserves or valuation were given to any wells beyond their economic cut-off. Where no production decline trends have been established due to the limited historical production records from wells on the properties, surrounding wells historical production records were used and extrapolated to wells of the property. Where applicable, the actual calculated present decline rate of any well was used to determine future production volumes to be economically recovered. The calculated present rate of decline was then used to determine the present economic life of the production from the reservoir.
 
For wells currently on production, forecasts of future production rates were based on historical performance data. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied to economic depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.
 
Proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves were estimated primarily by the performance and historical extrapolation methods. Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates from those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at a date we determined to be reasonable.
 
In general, the volume of production from our oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent, we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities, or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Accordingly, volumes generated from our future activities are highly dependent upon the level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves and the costs incurred in doing so.

Government Regulation
 
Various state, province and federal agencies regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas. All states and provinces in which we plan to operate impose restrictions on the drilling, production, transportation and sale of oil and natural gas.


Our sale of oil and natural gas liquids will not be regulated and will be at market prices. The price received from the sale of these products will be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines.
 
Federal, state, and local agencies have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations. Most states require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and the filing of reports concerning operations, and impose other requirements relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from our properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with those laws.
 
Competition and Marketing
 
We will be faced with strong competition from many other companies and individuals engaged in the oil and gas business, many are very large, well established energy companies with substantial capabilities and established earnings records. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring oil and gas prospects since we must compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs. It is nearly impossible to estimate the number of competitors; however, it is known that there are many companies and individuals in the oil and gas business.
 
Exploration for and production of oil and gas are affected by the availability of pipe, casing and other tubular goods and certain other oil field equipment including drilling rigs and tools. We will depend upon independent drilling contractors to furnish rigs, equipment, and tools to drill our wells. Higher prices for oil and gas may result in competition among operators for drilling equipment, tubular goods and drilling crews which may affect our ability to expeditiously drill, complete, recomplete and work-over wells.
 
The market for oil and gas is dependent upon several factors beyond our control, which at times cannot be accurately predicted. These factors include the proximity of wells to, and the capacity of, natural gas pipelines, the extent of competitive domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the availability of other sources of energy, fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, and governmental regulation. In addition, there is always the possibility that new legislation may be enacted that would impose price controls or additional excise taxes upon crude oil or natural gas, or both. Oversupplies of natural gas can be expected to recur from time to time and may result in the gas producing wells being shut in.
