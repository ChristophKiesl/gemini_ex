Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an advanced, late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted antibacterial products that address high unmet medical needs to treat serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. On February 1, 2022. our Board of Directors received a preliminary, non-binding proposal from our majority stockholder, Innoviva Inc., or Innoviva, to acquire all the outstanding equity securities of the Company that are not currently owned by Innoviva for a per share consideration of $1.80, payable in cash. The offer letter delivered by Innoviva to our Board of Directors is publicly available in the Schedule 13D amendment dated February 1, 2022, filed by Innoviva with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Our Board of Directors, which does not include any members appointed by or affiliated with Innoviva, has retained MTS Health Partners, L.P. and Covington & Burling, LLP to explore alternatives and to assist the Board of Directors in its evaluation of the proposal consistent with its fiduciary duties.
​
Our lead product candidate, sulbactam-durlobactam, or SUL-DUR, is an intravenous, or IV, combination of sulbactam, an IV β-lactam antibiotic, and durlobactam, a novel broad-spectrum IV β-lactamase inhibitor, or BLI, that we are developing for the treatment of pneumonia and bloodstream infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, or Acinetobacter. Based on current carbapenem resistance rates, we estimate there are in excess of 250,000 hospital-treated carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections annually across the United States, Europe, the Middle East and China for which significant morbidity and mortality exists due to limited treatment options. We initiated ATTACK (Acinetobacter Treatment Trial Against Colistin), our single Phase 3 registration trial in 2019, and announced positive top-line Phase 3 data in October 2021 demonstrating that the primary efficacy and safety objectives had been achieved. Specifically, the results indicated non-inferiority in 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections and a statistically significant higher clinical cure rate compared to colistin. SUL-DUR also had a favorable safety profile when compared to colistin with a statistically significant reduction in nephrotoxicity. Based on the success of ATTACK and the totality of the SUL-DUR preclinical and clinical data, we also announced our intention to file a new drug application, or NDA, with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in mid-2022. SUL-DUR has been awarded Fast Track status designation providing potential eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review, if relevant criteria are met, following acceptance of our submission by the FDA. With the support of our partner Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Zai Lab (Nasdaq: ZLAB), we enrolled approximately 25% of the ATTACK trial in China and combined with the strength of the overall SUL-DUR data set, we believe the data will also support a regulatory submission in China. Zai Lab has an exclusive license to develop and commercialize SUL-DUR in mainland China as well as the broader Asia-Pacific region. 
Our second late-stage product candidate, zoliflodacin, is a novel orally administered molecule being developed for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. The bacterial pathogen responsible for gonorrhea is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or N. gonorrhoeae. Intramuscular injections of ceftriaxone now represent the only U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, recommended treatment option for the estimated 1.6 million annual cases of gonorrhea in the United States. We believe there is a growing unmet need for a single-dose oral antibiotic that will reliably treat patients with gonorrhea, including infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae, which are emerging globally. The Phase 3 registration trial, initiated in September 2019, is sponsored by our nonprofit collaborator, the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, or GARDP, which as the sponsor is also responsible for all Phase 3 clinical trial and pharmaceutical development expenses. GARDP has commercial rights to zoliflodacin in up to 168 low- and select middle-income countries, while Entasis retains commercial rights in the major markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Based on current enrollment rates, we anticipate the trial to be fully enrolled in 2023.

Our third product candidate is ETX0282CPDP which is a combination of a novel, oral BLI, ETX0282, with cefpodoxime proxetil or CPDP, which has the potential to address complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTIs, including those caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. We believe there is a significant unmet need for new oral antibiotics to reliably treat the estimated 3 to 4 million patients diagnosed annually with cUTIs. We have reported preliminary Phase 1 trial results, and we are now seeking a partner to help further advance ETX0282CPDP through additional clinical trials. This program was previously supported by the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator program, or CARB-X. 
We are also advancing the development of a novel class of antibiotics, non β-lactam inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins, or NBPs. We believe NBPs constitute a potential new class of Gram-negative antibacterial agents that are designed to target a broad spectrum of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens that overcome the main source of β-lactam resistance which is driven by β-lactamase activity. This novel class of agents is designed to potentially target a broad spectrum of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens that are part of the CDC/World Health Organization, or WHO, list of high unmet medical need or ESKAPE pathogens. We selected ETX0462 as the initial clinical candidate for this program and with support from CARB-X we are currently working to complete additional pre-clinical activities to enable the program to advance into a Phase 1 clinical trial. In June 2020, we were awarded a contract from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to support research towards developing additional NBP molecules with expanded Gram-negative spectrum from this novel class. This research program, designated NBP2, is attempting to target Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and E. coli from the ESKAPE list of pathogens. In July 2021, we successfully completed the first milestones for the program and were awarded the Option 1 Period of the program to proceed with further optimization, beginning August 1, 2021. Subject to achieving pre-defined milestones, the contract is expected to sufficiently fund activities to achieve submission of an investigational new drug, or IND, application to the FDA.
​
Our Strategy
Our goal is to maximize the value of our targeted antibacterial agents for the treatment of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Our strategy includes the following key components:

● | Advance our lead product candidate SUL-DUR through NDA filing and FDA approval. Our lead product candidate, SUL-DUR, is a novel IV antibiotic that is a combination of sulbactam, an IV β-lactam antibiotic, and durlobactam, our novel BLI, that we are developing for the treatment of a variety of serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter. We announced positive Phase 3 top-line data in October 2021, and based on the totality of our preclinical and clinical data, we announced our intention to file an NDA in mid-2022. SUL-DUR has been awarded Fast Track status designation providing potential eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review, if relevant criteria are met, following acceptance of our submission by the FDA. We believe SUL-DUR has the ability to improve outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections, reducing their overall mortality. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance our existing pipeline of pathogen targeted antibiotics for infections poorly treated by existing generic or branded antibiotics. In addition to SUL-DUR, we believe that our pipeline product candidates present differentiated and compelling solutions for infections caused by certain multidrug resistant pathogens. Zoliflodacin is an oral, potential single-dose treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by N. gonorrhoeae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ETX0282CPDP is a potential treatment of cUTIs, including those caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. ETX0462 is being developed to address multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas and biothreat pathogens. To support the development of our pipeline we have successfully collaborated with commercial as well as nonprofit organizations, government agencies and other third parties, including Zai Lab, GARDP, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, or NIAID, the U.S. Department of Defense, or DOD, and CARB-X, and the Repair Fund, to secure financial and technical support of our research and development efforts.

Antibiotics Background
The introduction of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections is recognized as one of the most transformative events in medicine. Antibiotics either kill bacteria (cytocidal) or inhibit bacterial cell growth (cytostatic), in both cases allowing the body’s natural immune system to clear the bacteria. After penicillin, a β-lactam class antibiotic, entered the market in the early 1940s, antibiotics became one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in history. The modern era of antibiotics began in the 1950s with the discovery and commercialization of a number of antibiotic classes and molecules including additional β-lactams, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and polymyxins.
There are two main varieties of bacteria, Gram-positive and Gram-negative, which are identified using a common laboratory staining test known as the “Gram stain.” Gram-positive bacteria are surrounded by a single membrane, while Gram-negative bacteria have both an inner membrane and an outer membrane. Due to this increased complexity, it has historically been more challenging to develop products that target Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Enterobacteriaceae, a family of related organisms that includes the Enterobacter species, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumonia. In the United States, approximately 8.2 million bacterial infections are treated in the hospital annually. Approximately 60% of hospital-treated infections are Gram-negative, and over 140,000 patients treated in the hospital for Gram-negative infections die annually in the United States.

7



One of the most widely used antibiotic classes are β-lactams due to the combination of their attractive safety and efficacy profile. β-lactams work by inhibiting penicillin binding proteins, or PBPs, proteins that play an important role in bacterial cell wall synthesis and are essential for the growth and reproduction of bacteria. β-Lactam antibiotics consist of all antibiotic agents that contain a β-lactam ring in their molecular structures. Among β-lactam antibiotics, penicillin derivatives and cephalosporins are the most commonly used. Carbapenems, another class of β-lactam antibiotics, are generally more effective against Gram-negative multidrug resistant pathogens; but to preserve their activity, they are often limited for use as a last resort.
Antibiotic Resistance 
Antibiotic resistance is a direct consequence of antibiotic use. No sooner was penicillin adopted in clinical use, that the first cases of penicillin-resistant infections were reported. Indeed, resistance to penicillin, as was subsequently found to be the case for other natural product-derived antibiotics, pre-dates its medicinal use. This issue has escalated in the modern era, as millions of metric tons of antibiotics have been produced for human therapeutic use and use in agriculture and animal husbandry. This increased demand and use of antibiotics has contributed significantly to the emergence of resistant strains. For a period, the discovery of new antibiotics kept pace with the emergence of resistance; however, this is no longer the case and as a result, clinicians now commonly resort to using a combination of suboptimal antibiotics in an attempt to treat antibiotic resistant infections. For example, in the United States and European Union from 2004 to 2015, the use of last-resort antibiotics, carbapenems and polymyxins, increased annually by 6% and 8%, respectively. The negative consequences of this approach are twofold, as inappropriate antibiotic therapy leads to poorer outcomes for patients and potential subinhibitory and subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations can further promote the development of antibiotic resistance. 
Antibiotic resistance is now a global health threat and when bacteria develop resistance to drugs in at least three or more antibiotic classes, they are commonly referred to as multidrug-resistant. Bacteria use a number of mechanisms to develop resistance to antibiotics. Resistance to β-lactam antibiotics primarily occurs when bacteria acquire foreign genes that encode β-lactamases, enzymes that inactivate the β-lactam antibiotic by breaking apart the β-lactam ring, which renders the antibiotic inactive. Below, a β-lactamase enzyme (blue box) is shown binding to and cleaving the blue β-lactam ring of a carbapenem antibiotic. β-lactamases are widely prevalent and are classified into four classes, Classes A, B, C and D. Since 1976, researchers have discovered and developed β-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) that essentially restore the efficacy of the β-lactam antibiotic by neutralizing β-lactamase enzymes. Despite the discovery and regulatory approval of novel BLIs, currently marketed BLIs do not broadly inhibit Class D β-lactamases, which are a particular concern in infections caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter.
Antibiotic-resistant infections often result in high morbidity and, in many cases, mortality. According to the article “Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 2019: a systematic analysis” published in The Lancet on February 12, 2022, antimicrobial resistance was associated with approximately 4.95 million deaths and directly attributed to 1.27 million deaths in 2019. In the United States alone, antibiotic-resistant infections are estimated to add $20 billion per year to healthcare costs. Due to the limitations of current treatment options and growing antibiotic resistance rates, the pathogens targeted by our current product candidates, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, CRE and N. gonorrhoeae, are all identified as high priority targets by the CDC and WHO, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or IDSA.

8



Rising antibiotic resistance has catalyzed a global call to action. Funding from government and nonprofit agencies for antibiotic research and development and an improved regulatory environment support the efficient development of novel antibiotics targeted at unmet need areas. GARDP, NIAID, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, the DOD, and the Innovative Medicines Initiative, all offer funding or services to support research and development of novel antibiotics.
Changes in the legal/policy landscape in the United States have also highlighted the growing importance of addressing antimicrobial resistance. Proposed legislation includes the Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms Act, or DISARM, which calls for payment of qualified infectious disease products, or QIDPs, outside of the hospital diagnosis-related group, or DRG, resulting in potentially higher Medicare reimbursement for those novel antibiotics designated as QIDPs. Qualifying hospitals would be required to participate in a specified antibiotic stewardship program in order to be eligible for higher payment. More recently, this legislation was reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in June 2021, which aims to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to encourage the development and use of DISARM antimicrobial drugs, and for other purposes. The Pioneering Antimicrobial Subscriptions to End Upsurging Resistance Act of 2020, or PASTEUR Act, was introduced to provide a mechanism for funding designated “critical need antimicrobial” drugs following FDA approval. In return, patients covered by federal insurance programs will receive these drugs at no cost. These contracts could range from $750 million to $3 billion in value. In October 2021, the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, or PACCARB, authored a letter to the Honorable Xavier Becerra Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services recommending the passage of both DISARM and PASTEUR and the antimicrobial stewardship provisions contained within each act.

Our Product Candidates
Sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR)
Overview
Our lead product candidate, SUL-DUR, is a novel IV antibiotic with broad spectrum β-lactamase coverage including Classes A, C and D. The product is a combination of sulbactam, a β-lactam antibiotic, and durlobactam, our novel BLI, that we are developing for the treatment of a variety of serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter. We have completed three separate Phase 1 clinical trials, including one evaluating the penetration of SUL-DUR into the lung and one in renally impaired patients. Subsequently, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with cUTIs. We initiated ATTACK, our single Phase 3 registration trial in 2019, that evaluated SUL-DUR in patients with confirmed carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter pneumonia and/or bloodstream infections. We announced positive top-line Phase 3 data in October 2021 and based on our positive top-line Phase 3 data and the totality of our preclinical and clinical data, announced our intention to file an NDA with the FDA in mid-2022. We believe SUL-DUR has the ability to improve outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections, reducing their overall mortality. 
Acinetobacter
Acinetobacter is a Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen that predominantly infects critically ill patients often resulting in severe pneumonia and bloodstream infections but can also infect other body sites as well. Once thought to be mostly benign, Acinetobacter is now considered a global threat in the healthcare setting due in part to its ability to acquire multidrug resistance at rates not previously seen in other bacteria. In addition, Acinetobacter has the ability to remain viable for up to 100 days in dry conditions and easily spreads via air or water droplets, which explains why the pathogen can often be found in many locations in the intensive care unit, or ICU, including bedrails, bedside tables, monitors of mechanical ventilators, intravenous pumps, door handles, stethoscopes and many other locations. Of significant concern, one study reported greater than 98% of Acinetobacter isolates in an ICU from non-clinical sources such as bedrails and door handles, were determined to be multidrug resistant. 

9



Pneumonia and bloodstream infections caused by drug-resistant Acinetobacter can have mortality rates approaching 50%. Antibiotic-resistance rates of Acinetobacter to current standard-of-care treatments are some of the highest reported, between 30% and 50% in the United States and greater than 90% in parts of Europe and Asia. Acinetobacter resistance to β-lactams is primarily driven by the expression of Class D β-lactamases, often in combination with Class A and/or Class C β-lactamases. There are currently no effective antibiotics indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections. Durlobactam is the first clinical-stage BLI with sufficient broad-spectrum activity against class A, C, and D β-lactamases to potentially restore the efficacy of β-lactam antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter. 
Sulbactam, the β-lactam antibiotic used in SUL-DUR has superior microbiological potency against Acinetobacter compared to other β-lactam antibiotics based on in vitro and in vivo analyses. Historically, physicians used sulbactam to successfully treat Acinetobacter infections before development of broad β-lactamase mediated resistance rendered sulbactam on its own largely ineffective. We believe our data demonstrates that combining durlobactam with sulbactam can effectively restore the activity of sulbactam against multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter.
Market Opportunity
We estimate that there are 180,000 to 220,000 hospital-treated Acinetobacter infections annually in the United States and Europe, of which 65,000 to 100,000 are carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections, which we regard as our initial target markets for SUL-DUR. We also believe there could be a significant market opportunity in Asia-Pacific, Central and South America, Russia and the Middle East given resistance rates exceeding 80% in some countries. If approved, we believe SUL-DUR has the potential to address the issues of resistance facing existing regimens, which is currently limiting the utility of the carbapenems, and tolerability, which is a concern with regimens containing colistin. There are currently no antibiotics indicated for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections.
Clinical Development Plan
Completed Clinical Trials
Phase 3 registration trial: We completed ATTACK, a Phase 3 registration trial of SUL-DUR for the treatment of patients with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections, with positive top-line data announced in October 2021. ATTACK enrolled 207 patients at 95 clinical sites in 16 countries. This was a two-part trial with Part A being the randomized, comparative portion (SUL-DUR vs colistin) in patients with documented Acinetobacter hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VAPB), ventilated pneumonia (VP), or bacteremia, and Part B being an open-labeled portion including Acinetobacter infections resistant to, or having previously failed colistin or polymyxin B treatment. Baseline Acinetobacter isolates tested were greater than 95% carbapenem resistant. 
​
SUL-DUR met the primary efficacy endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality compared to colistin in the CRABC m-MITT population of Part A. SUL-DUR mortality was 19.0% (12/63) compared to 32.3% (20/62) in the colistin arm (treatment difference of -13.2%; 95% CI: -30.0, 3.5). Similar trends were demonstrated in 28-day and 14-day all-cause mortality favoring SUL-DUR across all study populations evaluated to date. A statistically significant difference in clinical cure at Test of Cure (TOC) was observed with 61.9% in SUL-DUR arm compared to 40.3% in the colistin arm (95% CI 2.9-40.3). In Part B, the 28-day all-cause mortality was 17.9% (5/28) and consistent with that observed in Part A. 

10



​
Safety analyses from a total of 177 patients suggested that SUL-DUR was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile compared to colistin. SUL-DUR met the primary safety objective with a statistically significant reduction in nephrotoxicity as measured by the RIFLE classification for acute kidney injury. SUL-DUR nephrotoxicity was 13.2% (12/91) versus 37.6% (32/85) in the colistin arm (p = 0. 0002). Overall adverse events (AEs) in the safety population were comparable between treatment groups with 87.9% (80/91) in the SUL-DUR arm vs. 94.2% (81/86) in the colistin arm in Part A, 89.3% (25/28) in Part B. Drug related AEs were 12.1% (10.7% in Part B) with SUL-DUR compared to 30.2% with colistin. The most common non-infectious AEs (≥10%) in the SUL-DUR arm were diarrhea (16.5%), allergic and hypersensitivity reactions (16.5%), anemia (13.2%) and hypokalemia (12.1%) in Part A. These AEs were also >10% in the colistin arm as was acute kidney injury. 
​
We believe that the data from the ATTACK trial, data from our other clinical trials of SUL-DUR and non-clinical data will be sufficient to submit an NDA to the FDA in mid-2022.
​
Phase 2 clinical trial in cUTI patients: We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in cUTI patients to provide additional safety and pharmacokinetic, or PK, data as well as efficacy data against carbapenem-resistant pathogens. Eighty patients were randomized to receive either a dose of SUL-DUR or placebo every six hours for seven days. Patients in both arms also received background therapy, which is current standard-of-care, with 500 mg of imipenem, or IMI, administered through IV every six hours. There were no serious adverse events reported and the adverse event profile of SUL-DUR plus IMI was similar to that of the IMI comparator arm. PK data observed in the Phase 2 trial was consistent with the PK data observed in the Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers.
We have completed three Phase 1 clinical trials, highlighted below, in addition to a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with cUTIs. In all of these clinical trials, SUL-DUR was observed to be generally well tolerated.
Four-part Phase 1 first-in-human trial: Our four-part Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial was conducted in Australia in 124 healthy volunteers. SUL-DUR was generally well tolerated, with no dose-related systemic adverse events or drug-related serious adverse events reported. SUL-DUR also exhibited linear dose-dependent increases in exposure and PK parameters across the dose range studied.
Phase 1 lung trial: Our Phase 1 lung trial assessed the concentration of SUL-DUR in lung fluid, an important metric to understand, because ATTACK includes patients with pneumonia and lack of appropriate lung tissue penetration has been found to contribute to reduced efficacy. We believe that the levels of SUL-DUR in the lung fluid achieved in this trial support its continued development as a potential treatment for pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter.
Phase 1 renal trial: Our Phase 1 renal trial analyzed serum levels in renally impaired patients and provided data to enable the development of a dose adjustment protocol for the type of patient targeted in our ongoing Phase 3 registration trial.
We submitted an IND for SUL-DUR to the FDA in June 2017, and the FDA notified us in July 2017 that we could proceed with this program. The FDA granted Fast Track and QIDP designation for SUL-DUR in September 2017 for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia and bloodstream infections due to Acinetobacter. 

​
Global Acinetobacter Surveillance Data 
​
 We designed durlobactam to achieve broad activity against a wide range of β-lactamases, including Classes A, C and D, unlike currently marketed BLIs that primarily cover only Class A and Class C β-lactamases. Durlobactam is the first BLI in clinical development with such a broad spectrum of in vitro activity. 
​
SUL-DUR has also exhibited potent microbiological activity against Acinetobacter strains in vitro. Over a series of studies summarized in the figure below, we have compared the effectiveness of SUL-DUR, sulbactam alone and comparators in inhibiting 7,221 strains of Acinetobacter that were collected from patients around the world between 2011 and 2020. Amikacin and colistin were tested against 6,418 of the 7,221 strains. The plot in the figure below 

11



presents the cumulative percentage of these strains inhibited by increasing concentrations of each of the tested compounds. Sulbactam alone, as well as most of the other marketed antibiotics, had a very high MIC90 value of 64 mg/L, meaning that concentrations of 64 mg/L or greater were required to inhibit growth of 90% of the strains. The corresponding breakpoints, which are established by the Clinical & Lab Standards Institute, or CLSI, as the specified concentrations for each antibiotic that define whether a strain is considered resistant, are significantly lower than their MIC90 values. If the MIC90 of a drug is lower than its CLSI breakpoint, then that drug would be expected to be effective against more than 90% of the strains. If a drug’s MIC90 is higher than its breakpoint, the drug would not be expected to have broad efficacy against those strains. This cumulative analysis suggests that recent global strains of Acinetobacter are resistant to all the comparator antibiotics other than colistin, consistent with their significantly diminished clinical utility against Acinetobacter infections. In contrast, SUL-DUR had very potent activity, with a much lower MIC90 of 2 mg/L. This is lower than the CLSI breakpoint for sulbactam, which is 4 mg/L (in Unasyn®, a combination of sulbactam and ampicillin), suggesting that our chosen target exposure levels of SUL-DUR may be effective against more than 90% of global, multidrug resistant Acinetobacter strains. A subset of 926 isolates out of the 7,221 strains tested were from Chinese hospitals collected in 2016-2018. 831 of the 926 (84.6%) Chinese isolates were carbapenem-resistant. In contrast, SUL-DUR showed potent activity against this subset, with an MIC90 of 2 mg/L and 97.9% of isolates susceptible to ≤ 4 mg/L of SUL-DUR.
​
​
Competition
We are initially developing SUL-DUR for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections. Due to rising resistance rates, standard-of-care treatment for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections often includes a combination of several last-line treatment options, including carbapenems, tetracyclines, polymyxins, and other generically available agents. Despite using best available therapy, mortality rates of patients with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections is reported as high as 50%. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any marketed antibiotic that is indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections; however, we are aware of other potentially competitive products that have shown in vitro activity against some strains of Acinetobacter. Melinta Therapeutics Inc. currently markets minocycline while La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company, Inc. currently markets eravacycline for complicated intra-abdominal infections. Although recently approved for treating cUTIs, Fetroja®, from Shionogi & Co., Ltd., includes in its label a specific warning of an observed increase in all-cause mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections that were treated with the drug. BioVersys AG reported in 

12



March 2021 that their lead program BV100 is progressing in Phase 1 clinical development specifically for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections. 
​
Manufacturing Approach 
​
We contract with third party contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacture, packaging and labeling of sulbactam and durlobactam for preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we intend to continue to use third party manufacturing organizations in connection with any future commercialization of SUL-DUR. We continue to work with our current manufacturing partners to improve processes to increase our manufacturing capacity, reduce overall cost of manufacturing, and implement other steps toward commercial readiness. Our current manufacturing partners produce drug substance and drug product pursuant to agreements that require compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). We are currently negotiating commercial supply agreements with third party manufacturing organizations and will look to finalize these agreements as part of commercial readiness.
​
Commercial Approach
In the United States, our commercial strategy is driven by our understanding of where Acinetobacter infections are known to exist. Given that Acinetobacter infections more commonly occur in immunocompromised patients, treatment settings for these patients are frequently large intensive care units (ICUs), specialized centers like transplant, cancer, and burn, outpatient long-term acute centers (LTACs) and home infusion. 
SUL-DUR has been developed specifically for multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter infections and we believe the unmet need and value proposition of SUL-DUR will support its use for treating infections caused by this serious Gram-negative pathogen. This value proposition includes:

1. | Acinetobacter infections currently cost lives. There is an urgent, global unmet medical need due to the limitations of currently available treatment options. Published mortality rates of Acinetobacter infections treated with best available therapy are reported to exceed 50%.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Acinetobacter infections currently cost time. These serious infections directly lead to time in a hospital where hospital length of stay is often measured in months or weeks instead of days.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Acinetobacter infections currently cost money. Given the limitations described above, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections are reported to be one of the costliest to treat, exceeding $75,000 per case based upon published literature. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | We believe the data from ATTACK, combined with our overall preclinical and clinical data package, clearly demonstrate an efficacy and safety benefit of SUL-DUR over colistin in treating carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter infections.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Acinetobacter treatment protocols allow for clear positioning of SUL-DUR. Patients with suspected Acinetobacter infections are frequently treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, commonly a carbapenem, as first-line therapy. If susceptibility testing identifies that the causative bacterial pathogen is carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter, the patient is then frequently switched to a colistin-based antibiotic regimen in an attempt to successfully treat the infection. Published literature, however, reports greater than 50% mortality rates using colistin-based regimens. We believe that the data from the ATTACK Phase 3 registration trial demonstrate improved efficacy and safety profiles, that could result in SUL-DUR, if approved, being preferred to a colistin-based regimen for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, including carbapenem-resistant, Acinetobacter infections. 
Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections also present a significant unmet medical need in China and across the broader Asia/Pacific territory. Our collaboration and license agreement with Zai Lab, which included their participation in the ATTACK Phase 3 registration clinical trial, provides a potentially accelerated path for regulatory approval and commercialization in China and Asia-Pacific territories. Zai Lab supported the enrollment of approximately 25% of the evaluable patients in ATTACK from China, which we believe will support a regulatory

submission in China. Under our agreement with Zai Lab, we receive upfront, milestone and royalty payments in addition to payment of certain Phase 3 registration clinical trial costs. We maintain 100% of the rights and associated economics in North America and Europe. Outside of the United States, we intend to work with multi-national pharmaceutical companies to leverage their commercialization capabilities in territories not covered by our agreement with Zai Lab.

Zoliflodacin
Overview
Our second late-stage product candidate is zoliflodacin, a potential single oral dose cure for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by the bacterial pathogen N. gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea is an area of significant medical need and zoliflodacin is the only novel single dose treatment in development that provides a potential monotherapy oral alternative to intramuscular injections of ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhea, including infections caused by drug-resistant strains. Zoliflodacin targets the validated mechanism of action of the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics but does so in a novel manner to avoid existing fluoroquinolone resistance. We have completed several Phase 1 clinical trials and a Phase 2 clinical trial of zoliflodacin in patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea. In collaboration with GARDP, in 2019 we initiated a single Phase 3 registration trial of zoliflodacin in patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea. GARDP will fund all the Phase 3 clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs and in return will receive commercial rights for zoliflodacin in WHO-defined low-income and select middle-income countries. We have retained commercial rights in all other countries, including the major markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.
Gonorrhea
Uncomplicated gonorrhea is an N. gonorrhoeae infection of the urethra, cervix, pharynx or rectum, and is more common than complicated gonorrhea, which includes spread of the infection to other tissues and potentially the bloodstream. Gonorrhea can be associated with serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility, as well as an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Despite the continued use of effective antibiotics, it remains one of the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infections in the world with an estimated 87 million people worldwide infected each year. The occasional absence of symptoms, more frequent in women, is thought to be one reason for sustained levels of infection. Reports on the lack of a robust immune response to infection by N. gonorrhoeae in humans is also thought to facilitate not only initial infection but also reinfection. Efforts to develop a prophylactic vaccine for N. gonorrhoeae continue; however, to date all have failed, again thought to be the result of insufficient or absent protective immunity to N. gonorrhoeae infections in humans. Taken together, antibiotics remain the mainstay for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by N. gonorrhoeae. 

14



N. gonorrhoeae is the bacterial pathogen responsible for gonorrhea and has a strong propensity for uptake of chromosomal DNA from other genera of Neisseria which allows the bacteria to accumulate many mutations in chromosomal genes leading to frequent resistance of antibiotics. For example, penicillin was introduced for N. gonorrhoeae infections in 1943, and initial resistance was reported in 1945. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were first used to treat gonorrhea in 1949 and have been one of the most successful classes of antibiotics against N. gonorrhoeae, but even so resistance was identified in 1969. One member of this class, ciprofloxacin, was introduced in 1980 and resistance was identified in 1990. More recently cephalosporin antibiotics, notably cefixime, had been widely used for the treatment of gonorrhea due to their oral administration along with a favorable efficacy and safety profile, although resistance by N. gonorrhoeae has been reported since 2007. As widespread use of these antibiotics drove the emergence of drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains, treatment guidelines have subsequently been amended. Ceftriaxone is currently the only CDC-recommended option for the treatment of gonorrhea and, until recently, was administered with azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, to provide coverage against other sexually transmitted diseases that tend to occur concurrently with gonorrhea. However, rising resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to azithromycin recently prompted the CDC to now recommend ceftriaxone monotherapy. Ceftriaxone is administered by intramuscular injection, which can be painful and may require patient monitoring by a healthcare administrator. Although ceftriaxone remains effective in most of the U.S., in Hawaii as well as in several countries, including China, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, France and Spain, N. gonorrhoeae strains with resistance to azithromycin and ceftriaxone have been reported, prompting concerns that multidrug-resistant gonorrhea may become a major community health issue.
Market Opportunity
N. gonorrhoeae is an immediate global public health threat with 84.2 million cases worldwide in 2020 (WHO estimate). Cases of gonorrhea in the United States have reached an estimated 1.6 million per year. The WHO worldwide estimated of approximately 82.4 million new cases includes infected adolescents and adults aged 15–49 years. The CDC estimates that the cases of gonorrhea in the United States have been increasing at least 10% per year since 2009. In April 2021, the CDC announced that sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. reached all-time high for 6th consecutive year, with approximately 2.6 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea & syphilis reported in 2019. 
The results of a 2017-2018 survey of countries reporting decreased susceptibility, DS, or resistance, R, of N. gonorrhoeae to current antibiotics is reflected in the table below.
​
Historically, to reduce the risk of spreading drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, the CDC has changed treatment guidelines when resistance rates to recommended first-line treatments reach 5%. Since 2015, there has only been one recommended treatment on CDC guidelines for gonorrhea: 250mg intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone plus 1g of oral azithromycin. In 2020 the CDC once again updated its treatment guideline, now recommending a 500mg intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. This follows a 2019 update in the United Kingdom where recommended empirical treatment of gonorrhea is now 1g intramuscular ceftriaxone monotherapy.

Clinical Development Plan
Ongoing Registration Trial
Phase 3 registration trial: In 2019, we announced the initiation of a global, multi-center Phase 3 registration trial in collaboration with GARDP who is conducting and funding all Phase 3 clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs. Up to 18 clinical trial sites are planned across the U.S., Thailand, South Africa, the Netherlands and Belgium. Our Phase 3 registration trial is a multi-center, open-label, noninferiority trial in approximately 1,000 enrolled patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea who will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to receive either a single 3.0g oral dose of zoliflodacin or a regimen of 500mg intramuscular ceftriaxone plus 1g oral azithromycin. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients with microbiological cure at urethral or cervical sites, approximately six days after treatment. The Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, in May 2021 recommended to continue the study without modification. Despite the ongoing challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed an increase in the enrollment rate during the past two quarters and based on current enrollment rates we anticipate completion of trial enrollment in 2023. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that the efficacy data from this single Phase 3 registration trial, if positive, along with the data from our other clinical trials of zoliflodacin, will be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA.
Completed Clinical Trials
Phase 2 clinical proof-of-concept trial: We have completed a multi-center, randomized, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial comparing a single oral dose of 2.0g or 3.0g of zoliflodacin to 500mg intramuscular ceftriaxone for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. In this trial, 179 randomized patients received treatment and zoliflodacin was generally well tolerated, with efficacy outcomes comparable to ceftriaxone. Microbiological eradication and clinical cure in urogenital infections with a single dose of zoliflodacin, the primary endpoint of the trial, was comparable to ceftriaxone, with 100% cure rate in both the 3.0g zoliflodacin and ceftriaxone groups in the per-protocol population. The results of this clinical trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2018.
Phase 1 clinical trial:  We evaluated zoliflodacin in two Phase 1 clinical trials studying 72 healthy volunteers in total. In one trial, we evaluated PKs and tolerability in 48 subjects and food effects in 18 subjects, and in the second trial, we evaluated absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in six subjects. Zoliflodacin was generally well tolerated in these trials at doses we would expect to be clinically active for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea. Administration of a high-fat meal was associated with an increase in zoliflodacin plasma concentration, suggesting that zoliflodacin could be administered with or without food.
Preclinical Data
We have generated biochemical, microbiological and in vivo data on zoliflodacin. The data suggest that zoliflodacin retains potent activity against contemporary clinical isolates in the U.S., Europe, China, Thailand and South Africa that are resistant to other antibiotic classes including fluroquinolones, which was expected given its novel mechanism of action. In addition, the data show significant resistance against two of the four standard antibiotics indicated for gonorrhea, ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, and azithromycin, a macrolide.

16



Competition
We are initially developing zoliflodacin as a single oral dose treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is commonly treated with combination therapy intramuscular ceftriaxone injection and oral azithromycin, both generically available agents. Additional generic cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are also prescribed, but not recommended as primary treatment options given current resistance rates. Gepotidacin, currently under development for a variety of infections by GlaxoSmithKline plc, is the only potentially competitive product candidate in late-stage clinical development that we are aware of that is being developed for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. A Phase 3 clinical trial (EAGLE-1) was initiated by GlaxoSmithKline in October 2019. A prior Phase 2 clinical trial revealed the emergence of resistance to gepotidacin in 2 urogenital microbiological failures following administration of a single oral dose. In an attempt to overcome this resistance, gepotidacin will be given in two oral doses in the EAGLE-1 clinical trial; a 4-tablet 3000 milligram (mg) oral dose at the study site followed by another 4-tablet 3000mg oral dose as an outpatient.
Manufacturing Approach 
GARDP has partnered with third party contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product for zoliflodacin. These partners are capable of producing commercial scale quantities of zoliflodacin drug substance and drug product under cGMP conditions. GARDP will develop direct long-term commercial supply agreements for sales in their respective territories. As we execute upon our commercialization strategy for zoliflodacin, we intend to work with the established zoliflodacin manufacturing partners for our commercial supply. 
​
Commercial Approach
Antibiotics to treat uncomplicated gonorrhea will typically be available through primary care physicians, outpatient clinics and emergency rooms, and numerous community sites. In addition, placement on CDC guidelines has historically driven awareness and uptake in the U.S. We have partnered with GARDP who will lead the commercialization of zoliflodacin in certain WHO-defined low-income and specified middle-income countries. 
​
Zoliflodacin is a potential single dose cure (sachet in water) that can facilitate “expedited partner therapy” at home, which may lower the chance for a repeat infection from a partner. Expedited partner therapy, or EPT, is the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea by providing prescriptions or medications to the patient to take to his/her partner without the health care provider first examining the partner. Within the United States, EPT is permissible in 45 states, potentially allowable in 4 states and is only prohibited in one state.
​
ETX0282CPDP
Overview
Our third product candidate is ETX0282CPDP for the potential oral treatment of cUTIs in the outpatient setting. ETX0282CPDP is a combination of ETX0282, a novel oral BLI, with cefpodoxime proxetil, or cefpodoxime, an oral β-lactam antibiotic. We believe ETX0282 is a highly differentiated oral β-lactamase inhibitor based on its broad inhibition of both Class A and Class C β-lactamases. We selected cefpodoxime as the β-lactam antibiotic to combine with ETX0282 following in vitro studies in which cefpodoxime exhibited superior activity against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae compared to other existing oral β-lactams. Cefpodoxime was once used to treat cUTIs, among other indications, but its clinical utility is currently limited by β-lactamase-mediated resistance. We believe ETX0282 has the potential to restore the efficacy of cefpodoxime against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. We have reported initial Phase 1 results, which indicate ETX0282 is generally safe and well tolerated and supports further progression. Having successfully completed the initial Phase 1 studies and preclinical work to deliver a formulation with the desired extended release profile, we now are seeking a partner to help further advance ETX0282CPDP through additional clinical trials. 

17



Urinary Tract Infections
A urinary tract infection, or UTI, diagnosis can be classified as either uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTI is an infection of one or more parts of the urinary tract system such as the kidneys, ureters, bladder or urethra with symptoms confined to the lower urinary tract and is often treated with generic oral antibiotics in the community setting. Uncomplicated UTIs, if left unresolved, can have serious consequences, including life-threatening kidney infections. cUTIs, including pyelonephritis, occur in a urinary tract that has metabolic, functional, or structural abnormality and include patients with comorbidities or patients with bladder catheters. These factors contribute to decreased resolution of such infections and therefore frequently require hospital-based therapy. ETX0282CPDP is designed to treat cUTIs, including those caused by multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including some carbapenem-resistant strains, or CRE. Enterobacteriaceae species cause approximately 85% of all UTIs, of which E. coli is the most common pathogen, causing approximately 75% of infections. In addition, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas are also relatively common UTI pathogens. The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has reduced the efficacy of commonly used oral antibiotics such as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, both fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In the United States, over 30% of UTIs caused by E. coli and 10% of UTIs caused by Klebsiella are resistant to fluoroquinolones.
Market Opportunity
Patients with UTIs caused by bacteria resistant to existing oral treatment options frequently require hospital admission for treatment with IV antibiotics, even when they are otherwise healthy and fit to be treated outside the hospital setting. In the United States, it is currently estimated that between 3 and 4 million UTIs are treated in the hospital per year. Hospital admission not only leads to inconvenience for the patient and high treatment cost for the healthcare system, but it also increases the risk of transmitting drug-resistant bacterial strains to other hospitalized patients and potentially exposing UTI patients to other, more serious hospital-acquired infections. There are currently no effective oral treatments available for cUTIs, including those caused by multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae. If approved, we believe ETX0282CPDP will provide clinicians a convenient, oral option to treat patients suffering from cUTIs caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, which could reduce the need for hospital or outpatient IV treatment of these infections. There is also an opportunity for ETX0282CPDP to facilitate early hospital discharge following a short course of IV antibiotics. 
Clinical Development Plan
Phase 1 clinical trial: We conducted a multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial of ETX0282 in Australia and initial data readout in June 2019. The Phase 1 clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study of ETX0282 alone, not in conjunction with CPDP and was designed to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and food effect in 99 healthy volunteers enrolled in 12 cohorts. The completed cohorts were; Part A: single-ascending dose escalation, fasted; Part B: food effect: fasted versus high fat meal; Part C: multiple dose with regular meals; Part D: drug-drug interaction with regular meals; and Part G: simulation of a high-fat PK profile (fasted).
Overall, the key findings were that ETX0282 was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, no significant adverse events were reported. ETX0282, as the prodrug, was rapidly converted to ETX1317, the active form of the drug, at all doses. Plasma concentrations were in therapeutic range and the conversion of ETX0282 to ETX1317 was not impacted by multiple dosing and with minimal accumulation. No drug-drug interactions were observed with cefpodoxime. 11 out of 77 subjects receiving ETX0282 experienced mild to moderate emesis (vomiting). The trial data indicated that emesis may be ameliorated by dosing with a high fat meal (not a normal diet). When ETX0282 was dosed in fasted healthy volunteers in a manner to mimic the PK of the high fat meal plus ETX0282 (Part G), no emesis was observed. Having reported preliminary Phase 1 trial results, we are now seeking a partner to help further advance ETX0282CPDP through additional clinical trials.

18



Competition
We initially designed ETX0282CPDP for the potential oral treatment of cUTIs in the outpatient setting. There are a variety of generically available antibiotic classes with limited utility available for the treatment of such infections, including cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. Additionally, there are several approved IV branded agents targeting multidrug-resistant cUTIs, including Avycaz®, Vabomere®, Zemdri®, as well as the more recently approved IV products Fetroja® (Shionogi & Co., Ltd) and Recarbrio® (Merck & Co., Inc.). We are aware of additional potentially competitive oral product candidates that may address a limited breadth of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens including tebipenem from Spero Therapeutics Inc., which completed a Phase 3 clinical trial and filed an NDA submission to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sulopenem, from Iterum Therapeutics Limited, has completed Phase 3 clinical trials and in the third quarter of 2021 received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA requesting additional data to support approval of oral sulopenem for the treatment of adult women with uncomplicated UTIs. Additional potentially competing programs in clinical development are Venatorx Pharmaceuticals’ Phase 1 VRX-7145, an orally bioavailable beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) in a fixed combination with the third generation orally bioavailable cephalosporin, ceftibuten. Initial Phase 1 data on VRX-7145 was announced in July 2021. Qpex Biopharma Inc. has announced the initiation of Phase 1 studies of ORAvance™, an ultra-broad-spectrum oral beta-lactamase inhibitor for use in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics for drug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections.
​
ETX0462
Overview
Leveraging our targeted-design platform, we have developed a potential new class of novel antibiotics that are non-β-lactam penicillin binding protein inhibitors which we are referring to as NBPs. In late 2019, we selected a new drug candidate from our NBP platform, ETX0462, a novel unsaturated diazabicyclooctane with antimicrobial activity against multiple Gram-negative pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as a number of high-priority biothreat pathogens. If successful in development, we believe our NBPs would be the first, novel Gram-negative antibiotic class since the carbapenems were introduced in 1985. In collaboration with CARB-X, we are advancing this program through registration safety studies and pre-formulation development and there is an option for support into Phase 1 human studies upon successful completion of the ongoing studies.
Pseudomonas
Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas are some of the most difficult to treat bacterial infections today. Carbapenems and cephalosporins are commonly used to treat susceptible cases of Pseudomonas. However, in the United States, approximately 20% of Pseudomonas are resistant to both classes of antibiotics. Some recently approved antibiotics demonstrate improved efficacy against Pseudomonas but are still prone to multiple mechanisms of resistance. In many cases, the only treatment option for multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas is colistin or other antibiotics of the same class. While these antibiotics are potent in preclinical models, in practice, clinicians tend to reserve their use as last resort treatment options due to their toxicity in the kidney and nervous system, which limits dosing and, therefore, clinical efficacy.
Market Opportunity
Pseudomonas causes a variety of opportunistic infections, including intra-abdominal infections, surgical site infections, UTIs and nosocomial pneumonia. Pseudomonas is the most common Gram-negative pathogen associated with ventilator-acquired pneumonia. This is due in-part to the larger genome compared to other bacteria, which enables Pseudomonas to encode enzymes that metabolize, transport and efflux antibiotics. In addition, biofilm formation has been reported in the lungs of patients infected with Pseudomonas, which acts as a barrier preventing antibiotic access to the bacteria. Pseudomonas infections are on the rise with an estimated 600,000 to 750,000 cases occurring annually in the United States. In 2014, approximately 20% of Pseudomonas infections were resistant to each of carbapenems, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones and 14% were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics. We believe our novel class of NBPs, including ETX0462, has the potential to be used as monotherapy against infections caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas. 

19



​
Competition 
​
We are initially developing ETX0462 for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas. There are a variety of generically available antibiotic classes available for the treatment of antibiotic sensitive Pseudomonas infections, including cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. However, there are fewer options for multidrug resistant Pseudomonas. Generic polymyxins like Colistin are often utilized in these infections, as are branded IV antibiotics including Avycaz® (Allergan Inc.), Zerbaxa®, and Recarbrio® (both from Merck & Co., Inc.) and Vabomere® (Melinta, Inc.). Cayston® (Gilead Inc.) is an inhaled antibiotic addressing Pseudomonas infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Zerbaxa® and Cayston® are unfortunately not active when Pseudomonas expresses a carbapenemase enzyme but can potentially overcome other forms of resistance. The other three branded agents are BL/BLI combinations, and Pseudomonas has begun to develop resistance to this class of antibiotics via porin channel mutations or efflux pumps. We are aware of additional potentially competitive product candidates in clinical development that may address certain Pseudomonas infections including: Ftortiazinon, a small molecule in Phase 2 from the Gamaleya Research Institute (Russia); AR101, a monoclonal antibody in Phase 2 from Aridis Pharmaceuticals Inc.; AP-PA02, a Phase 1b/2 phage candidate from Armata Pharmaceuticals Inc.
​
Supply and Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities to produce any of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for our required raw materials, drug substance, and finished drug product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. Although we have contracts with these third parties to meet our current clinical supply needs, we do not have any current contractual relationships with these third parties for the manufacture of commercial supply of our product candidates after they are approved. As our product candidates approach potential approval by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of those products. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing vendor relationships and processes.
Government and Nonprofit Awards 
Through December 31, 2021, we have received aggregate financial commitments of up to $24.4 million from the Trustees of Boston University through the CARB-X program, the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, a division of the U.S. Department of Defense, and NIAID in support of our ETX0282, ETX0462, NBP and discovery research programs. The CARB-X awards could provide up to a total of $18.5 million in funding and the NIH award could provide up to a total $15.5 million in funding based on the successful completion of prespecified milestones. These specified milestones include the completion of important steps for a development-stage project such as preclinical studies or clinical trials, manufacture and formulation work, submission of regulatory applications and regulatory meetings with the FDA or comparable foreign regulator. 
COVID-19 Business Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy and healthcare industry, causing disruptions to business operations, interruptions in supply chains, and crowding hospitals and other healthcare facilities. With regard to our operations ,the pandemic continues to impact our ongoing clinical trial for zoliflodacin as patients either avoid seeking treatment or fail to return for follow-up visits due to crowded healthcare facilities. Aside from this impact, the pandemic has had little to no impact on our employees, other research and development pipeline programs, our ability to communicate with and manage our key vendors, partners, and drug supply chains, and accurately and timely file our financial statements. Although we are continuing to actively monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and pipeline programs, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.

License and Collaboration Agreements
A significant part of our strategy is to partner with established pharmaceutical companies, as well as nonprofit organizations, government agencies and other third parties to provide financial and technical support in the development and marketing of our products. 
Zai Lab
In April 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Zai Lab for the development and commercialization of products containing durlobactam or SUL-DUR in the following countries in the Asia Pacific region: China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, which we refer to collectively as the territory. Under the agreement, we granted Zai Lab an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, under our technology to develop, manufacture and sell products containing durlobactam or SUL-DUR, or the licensed products, in the territory. Additionally, we granted Zai Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide license to our technology as required for Zai Lab to practice its exclusive license with respect to the licensed products. We retain the right to use our technology to perform our obligations under the agreement and retain the exclusive right to use our technology in all other countries, including North America and Europe.
Under the agreement, Zai Lab will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform and fund costs associated with our ATTACK Phase 3 registration trial of SUL-DUR in China. Zai Lab is responsible, at its expense, for developing licensed products in the territory, to be coordinated with our continued global efforts with respect to products containing SUL-DUR. Zai Lab must use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct development activities described in the agreed-upon written development plan and to obtain regulatory approval in a specified number of countries in the territory beyond China after regulatory approval of a licensed product in China. Zai Lab is also solely responsible for commercializing licensed products in the territory and must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products for which it has obtained regulatory approval. We are also obligated to supply Zai Lab with the licensed products for clinical development, although Zai Lab may take over manufacturing responsibilities for its own commercialization activities within a specified time period following the effective date of the agreement. Both parties are prohibited from developing and commercializing products in the territory that would compete with the licensed products.
We received an upfront, non-refundable payment of $5.0 million, milestone payments of $7.0 million, research support funding of $0.6 million and certain other reimbursable registration trial costs of $5.4 million, less applicable taxes of $2.2 million from Zai Lab through December 31, 2021. We are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $91.0 million in additional research and development support payments and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments related to SUL-DUR, imipenem and other combinations with the licensed products. Zai Lab will pay us a tiered royalty equal to a high-single digit to low-double digit percentage based on annual net sales of licensed products in the territory, subject to specified reductions for the market entry of competing products, loss of patent coverage of licensed products and for payments owed to third parties for additional rights necessary to commercialize licensed products in the territory.
Zai Lab may terminate the agreement upon written notice to us at any time and for any reason. Further, we can terminate the agreement if Zai Lab ceases to commercialize the licensed products or challenges any of the patents we licensed to it. 
GARDP
In July 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with GARDP for the development and commercialization of a product candidate containing zoliflodacin in certain countries. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, GARDP will use commercially reasonable endeavors to perform and fully fund the Phase 3 registration trial, including the manufacture and supply of the product candidate containing zoliflodacin, in uncomplicated gonorrhea. Both parties are responsible for obtaining marketing authorizations for any future product candidate in such parts of their respective territories as they elect.

21



In addition, under the collaboration agreement, we have granted GARDP a worldwide, fully paid, exclusive and royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use our zoliflodacin technology in connection with GARDP’s development, manufacture and commercialization of zoliflodacin in low-income and specified middle-income countries, which we refer to collectively as the GARDP territory. We have retained commercial rights in all other countries worldwide, including the major markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We also have retained the right to use and grant licenses to our zoliflodacin technology to perform our obligations under the collaboration agreement and for any purpose other than gonorrhea or community-acquired indications. GARDP will own all intellectual property developed in its performance under the collaboration agreement regarding formulation development of zoliflodacin. In the event we undertake and fund additional efforts outside of the current agreed-upon development plan for zoliflodacin in our territory that leads to the creation of new intellectual property, we will have a right to file and maintain this new intellectual property. In addition, we are obligated to maintain the intellectual property in the countries in the GARDP territory where we filed patent rights at the date of the agreement and, under specified conditions, in our territory, and GARDP must reimburse us for costs and expenses for the maintenance of such intellectual property rights in the countries of the GARDP territory. If we believe the results of the Phase 3 registration trial of zoliflodacin would be supportive of an application for marketing approval, we are obligated to use our best efforts to file an application for marketing approval with the FDA within six months of the completion of the trial and to use commercially reasonable endeavors to file an application for marketing approval with the EMA. Each party is responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain marketing authorizations for the product candidate in their respective territories.
Both parties have the right to terminate the collaboration agreement with 90 days’ written notice if the other party is in material breach or remains in material breach after a cure period, or with immediate effect upon the occurrence of certain specified events of insolvency. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement at any time after completion or earlier termination of the Phase 3 registration trial with 12 months’ prior notice. We may terminate the collaboration agreement if GARDP has not achieved certain clinical milestones within a specified time period, unless the nonachievement was due to specified types of delay.
AstraZeneca
In May 2015, we entered into a Business Transfer and Subscription Agreement, or the AstraZeneca Agreement, with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca UK Limited and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, which was amended and restated in March 2016 and further amended in August 2017, pursuant to which we obtained, among other things, worldwide rights to SUL-DUR, ETX0282 and zoliflodacin.
Pursuant to the terms of the AstraZeneca Agreement, we agreed to pay AstraZeneca a one-time milestone payment of $5.0 million within three months of achieving a specified cumulative net sales milestone for SUL-DUR. This milestone payment will be automatically waived should our common stock trade on Nasdaq at or above a specified price at the time we achieve such specified cumulative net sales milestone for SUL-DUR, subject to adjustment for share splits, dividends and other similar events. We are also obligated to pay AstraZeneca a one-time milestone payment of $10.0 million within two years of achieving the first commercial sale of zoliflodacin. If our board of directors deems the milestone payment obligation related to zoliflodacin to be significantly burdensome, AstraZeneca is required to explore in good faith, modifications to the timing of such payment. At our election, either milestone payment may be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and stock. Additionally, we are obligated to pay AstraZeneca tiered, single-digit royalties on the annual worldwide net sales of SUL-DUR and, and the lesser of tiered, single-digit royalties on the worldwide annual net sales of zoliflodacin and a specified share of the royalties we receive from sublicensees of zoliflodacin. Royalties on sales of zoliflodacin do not include sales by GARDP in low-income and select middle-income countries. Our obligation to make these royalty payments expires with respect to each product on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the 10 year anniversary of the first commercial sale of a product in each such country or (ii) when the last patent right covering a product expires in each such country. 
See Note 9, License and Collaboration Agreements, and Note 14, Commitments, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on these collaborations and license agreements.

Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates, our core technologies, and other know-how. To accomplish this we rely on the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. We file patent applications directed to our key product candidates to establish intellectual property positions. These patent applications are intended to protect new chemical entities relating to these product candidates as well as their manufacturing processes, intermediates and uses in the treatment of diseases.
The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced product candidates are summarized below.
 Durlobactam
Our intellectual property portfolio for our durlobactam program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for durlobactam and other chemical analogs, as well as methods of making, referred to as synthetic methods, and methods of use and modes of treatment using durlobactam in combination with one or more antibiotic compounds. As of December 31, 2021, we owned four issued U.S. patents, one pending provisional application, 69 issued foreign patents as well as 12 pending foreign patent applications, of which two are allowed. The issued foreign patents are in several jurisdictions including Australia, the European Union, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Macau, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Issued U.S. and foreign patents and patents issuing from pending U.S. and foreign applications will have expiration dates of April 2033 and November 2035.
 Zoliflodacin
Our intellectual property portfolio for zoliflodacin contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for zoliflodacin and other chemical analogs, as well as synthetic methods and methods of use and modes of treatment. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 7 issued U.S. patents, 71 issued foreign patents as well as six pending foreign patent applications. The issued foreign patents are in several jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Issued U.S. and foreign patents and patents issuing from pending U.S. and foreign applications have expiration dates of October 2029, January 2034 and May 2035.
 ETX0282
Our intellectual property portfolio for our ETX0282 program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for the prodrug ETX0282, the active molecule, ETX1317, and other chemical analogs, as well as synthetic methods, and methods of use and modes of treatment using ETX0282 and ETX1317 in combination with one or more antibiotic compounds. As of December 31, 2021, we owned one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. application, two issued foreign patents, four allowed foreign patents and 15 pending foreign patent applications, of which one is allowed. Issued U.S. and foreign patents and patents issuing from pending U.S. and foreign applications will have expiration dates of September 2037.
 ETX0462
Our intellectual property portfolio for our ETX0462 program contains patent applications directed to compositions of matter for ETX0462 and other chemical analogs, as well as synthetic methods, and methods of use and modes of treatment. As of December 31, 2021, we owned one granted U.S. patent application, one pending U.S. patent application, three issued foreign patents, and 17 pending foreign patent applications. Issued U.S. and foreign patents and patents issuing from pending U.S. and foreign applications will have expiration dates of May 2038.

 Provisional Patents
In addition to the issued and pending patent applications covering our most advanced product candidates, our portfolio also includes one pending PCT application relating to an early stage discovery project.
Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Know-How
Our trademark portfolio currently consists of registered trademark and service mark rights for ENTASIS THERAPEUTICS in several jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union, Japan, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico, Norway, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and the United Kingdom, and pending applications in other jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered trademark and service mark rights for ENTASIS THERAPEUTICS (plus design) in the United States, the European Union, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Australia, India, Norway, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, Mexico and the United Kingdom, and pending applications in other jurisdictions. We have also registered trademark rights for XACDURO and XULDURO in the United States, the European Union, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Macau, New Zealand, the Philippines, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Albania, Australia, Egypt, Macedonia, Mexico, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Indonesia, Israel, Laos, Japan, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam, and pending applications in other jurisdictions. In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we routinely seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patents and trademark protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of our products and reimbursement. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulation require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.

24



Approval Processes
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulation require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

● | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


● | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


● | warning letters, untitled letters and similar communications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizures or recalls; or
--+--------------------------------


● | total or partial suspension of production or distribution, or injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use, conducted in accordance with current good clinical practices, or cGCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards and FDA requirements for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------

25




● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s safety, identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical or nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND will also include one or more protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and any amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, including the occurrence of serious adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and any amendments before a clinical trial commences or continues at that institution, approve the information regarding the clinical trial and the informed consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

● | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as multidrug-resistant infections, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the target disease or condition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or 

26



terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for certain drugs and biologics. Specifically, PREA requires original NDAs, biologic license applications, or BLAs, and supplements thereto for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life. 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to completeness review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug that, if approved, would represent a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease or condition may receive priority review. Requests for priority review generally must be submitted at the time of NDA submission. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of new molecular entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider a major amendment to the application following the original submission. 
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing complies with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s safety, identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendation. 

27



Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. In addition, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS (which may include requirements for, restricted distribution and use), enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval. 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the FDA ultimately decides that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval, the FDA will issue a complete response letter to indicate that the agency will not approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
Expedited Review and Approval 
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and/or reviewing drugs. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases with the potential, based on nonclinical or clinical data, to fill an unmet medical need. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of treatment for a serious condition an expedited review within eight months from the completed submission (six months from filing) as compared to a standard review time of twelve months from the completed submission (10 months from filing) for a standard new molecular entity NDA. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. 
The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act, is intended to provide incentives for the development of new QIDPs. A new drug that is designated as a QIDP after a request by the sponsor that is made before an NDA is submitted will be eligible, if approved, for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have previously been eligible. In addition, a QIDP will receive priority review and qualify for a Fast Track designation. QIDPs are defined as antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen or qualifying pathogens identified by the FDA. SUL-DUR has been designated by the FDA as a QIDP for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia and bloodstream infections due to A. baumannii. Zoliflodacin has also been designated as a QIDP by the FDA for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.
Patent Term Restoration and Data Exclusivity 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. As noted above, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for a single patent for an approved product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the 

28



extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
Data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company using the drug entitled to data exclusivity as the reference listed drug, or RLD. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the use or conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent for other uses or conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct its own preclinical and clinical studies in support of its application or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 In addition, as described above, under the GAIN Act a new drug that is designated as a QIDP is eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain other exclusivity periods that the application may qualify for upon approval, specifically five-year exclusivity, three-year exclusivity, and orphan exclusivity. 
Pediatric Exclusivity
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides for an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added on to patent and exclusivity periods in effect at the time the pediatric exclusivity award is granted, if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. The FDA may request studies on approved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies. To date, we have not received any Written Requests.
Post-approval Requirements 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems, including safety issues, with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA and other authorities also strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. Under the FDCA the sponsor of an approved drug in the United States may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses, we may be subject to significant liability, including sanctions, civil and criminal fines and penalties, and injunctions prohibiting us from engaging in specified promotional conduct. 

29



Moreover, any drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:

● | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


● | reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | drug sampling and distribution requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. 
Failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

● | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


● | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


● | warning letters, untitled letters and similar communications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizures or recalls;
--+-----------------------------


● | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and DOJ, or other governmental entities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process 

30



and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications under the centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedures, or under the purely national route of approval. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases, and designated orphan medicines, and is optional for other medicines that are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, where it will be evaluated by the relevant scientific committee, in most cases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states and, by extension (after national implementing measures), in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. In general, an initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure allows marketing authorization applications to be submitted simultaneously in two or more EU member states, whereas the mutual recognition procedure must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EU member state. Both the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures provide for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the “reference” member state. 
Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must approve the assessment report and related materials, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. Under the mutual recognition procedure, the concerned member states have the same 90-day period to recognize the marketing authorization in the reference member state. In either case, concerns about serious risks to public health escalate through the relevant EMA scientific committees, and the disputed points may eventually result in a consensus opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that is referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. The purely national procedure results in a marketing authorization in a single EU member state.
Following the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020, and as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom and EU operate separate regulatory regimes. The UK and EU announced on December 24, 2020, that they had agreed a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, to govern their future relationship. The TCA remains provisional until formally ratified by the EU, which is expected to occur in early 2021. The TCA sets out the new arrangements for trade of goods, including medicines and medical devices, which aims to ensure goods continue to flow between the EU and the UK and also has implications for product regulation and mutual recognition.
​
As a result of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU, if a company wishes to sell its products in the United Kingdom, it will need to seek and maintain appropriate national marketing authorizations. The TCA does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of the regulatory regimes and so products exported from the UK to the EU must comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. In the pharmaceutical context, this has had a number of implications. From January 31, 2020, the UK no longer participated in EU institutions and their decision-making, including approval decisions under the centralized procedure. Moreover, the movement of finished pharmaceutical products into the EU from the UK is treated as an import from a third country. Since the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of batch testing and release, products must be quality control tested and released in the EU. However, the UK will unilaterally waive batch testing requirements for UK imports from the EU for products placed on the market before January 2023. It remains to be seen how these developments will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.

31



Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all the approved products for a particular indication.
To secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
Health Care Laws Governing Interactions with Healthcare Providers
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescriptions, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim for payment for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare 

32



and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, have also been alleged to violate false claims laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal and civil statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. As with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulations promulgated by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on covered entities (i.e., certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the children’s health insurance program (with certain exceptions) to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to covered recipients, including physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals’ covered recipients and information related to certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Finally, the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. In addition, some state laws require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing. Further, some state and local laws require the licensure of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Healthcare and Other Reform
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of significant legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. Federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there were ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under the ACA for individuals who do not maintain 

33



mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. In December 2019, the federal appellate court upheld the district court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The case has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court where a ruling remains pending.
There were other reform initiatives under the former Trump Administration, including initiatives focused on drug pricing. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase in the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70% starting in 2019. As another example, in 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the HHS, released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, has implemented others under its existing authority. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule through the CMS Innovation Center whereby Medicare Part B reimbursement for “certain high-cost prescriptions drugs” would be no more than most-favored-nation price (i.e., the lowest price) after adjustments, for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that has a comparable per-capita gross domestic product. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. While some of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, members of Congress and the new Biden administration have indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority, but it is not yet clear what steps the Biden Administration will take or whether such steps will be successful.
There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices and address price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
In 2019, the DISARM Act of 2019 was introduced in Congress as new legislation to provide financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics. This new legislation was guided by input from the IDSA and will help to ensure that patients can access new antibiotics when they are clinically appropriate, require hospitals to establish antibiotic stewardship programs, and spur improved reporting of antibiotic use and resistance to more rapidly identify challenges and inform best practices. More recently, this legislation was reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in June 2021 which aims to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to encourage the development and use of DISARM antimicrobial drugs, and for other purposes.
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare, but not Medicaid, payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. There was a temporary suspension of the 2% reduction during the pandemic; that temporary suspension is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2021. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
Legislation was introduced to the U.S. Senate in September 2020 which aims to reinvigorate innovation for the development of new antibiotics through a subscription contract program managed by HHS. The PASTEUR Act was introduced to provide a mechanism for funding designated ‘critical need antimicrobial’ drugs post FDA approval. In return, patients covered by federal insurance programs will receive these drugs at no cost. These Contracts under the PASTEUR Act could range from $750 million to $3 billion in value. It is unclear when or if the PASTEUR Act or similar incentive programs will become law. In October 2021, the PACCARB authored a letter to the Honorable Xavier 

34



Becerra, Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services recommending the passage of both DISARM and PASTEUR and the antimicrobial stewardship provisions contained within each act.

Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our current or future products if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the ACA or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
