Business Overview
 Kaspien’s mission is to accelerate partner brand growth on today’s leading online marketplaces. Our vision is to become a global leader in the brand accelerator industry by improving partner efficiency and profitability. Our marketplace as a service (“MaaS”) approach consists of delivering technology-enabled services to our partners, including software and associated support services. Our primary focus marketplaces are Amazon US, Amazon CA, Amazon DE and Amazon EU (including UK), with additional service and support available for Target+ and Walmart marketplaces.
 
Kaspien leverages its 13 years of ecommerce and online brand management experience to provide tech-enabled, partner-specific recommendations—resulting in a clear plan of action, pricing, and timeline. Our team of ecommerce experts use internal and external software to deliver insights and results in the areas of listing creation, content optimization, paid advertising, campaign management and supply chain / logistical support.
 
Our MaaS business delivers blended contribution margin across retail and agency models. This marketplace growth platform allows for a diversified go-to-market approach, enabling economies of scale for multiple operations.
 

• | Retail business model: We buy inventory and use our expertise, technology, and services to generate revenue through marketplace transactions. Kaspien provides account management, brand communications, listings management, data reporting, joint business planning and comprehensive marketing support services. Our target partners are enterprise-level and other large growth brands, and derive margin based on pricing.

Kaspien provides account management, media planning, media analytics, search strategy, business planning and data reporting support services. Our target partners in this space range from small, first-to-market brands to full-scale, enterprise brands. We derive margin based on a percentage of ad spend, commissions, and/or specific service fees.

Kaspien provides all the software and services required to drive brand growth and achieve a brand’s goals on Amazon, Walmart, and Target through multiple business models—namely, Retail and Agency services. We are a technology enabled services company built for marketplace growth. A high-level visualization of our business model is shown in Figure 1 below.
 



Partners
 Kaspien views all brand customers of our platform as partners. Our partners include brands, suppliers, distributors, liquidators, and affiliates such as venture capital firms and marketing agencies, as well as other industry brand aggregators. Our market sectors include but are not limited to: Pets & Sporting Goods, Baby, Tools/Office/Outdoors, and Health & Personal Care. In fiscal 2021, these top categories made approximately 70% of our total revenue. To accelerate the growth of our businesses, we have defined an operating model by segmenting our businesses into a portfolio of brands by category, which is run by a single-threaded leader or Partner Success Manager. Each Partner Success Manager is supported by a cross functional team, collectively called a “business POD”.  We organize our operations by category, developing a deep understanding and subject matter expertise in these areas, powering our platform to drive better results across these category focal points.
 
The Company uses its proprietary data platform to identify brands that would be good strategic fits for its services. We utilize content marketing to strengthen its visibility within the industry. The Company’s public relations efforts consist of press releases, articles in industry publications, and articles on its website to build its brand. In addition, we regularly publish eBooks, blog posts, case studies and webinars. Kaspien also runs advertisements on popular ad platforms such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to bring leads into its sales funnels.
 
Partnership Models
 The Kaspien platform can be leveraged and engaged via three primary and distinct business models.
 
Retail-as-a-Service (“RaaS”): We own inventory. We sell it.
 In this model, Kaspien buys inventory and sells it on marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target as a third-party seller. Additionally, Kaspien supports private label and dropship integrations with various suppliers and distributors, as well as incubates its own brands. At the end of fiscal 2021, Kaspien had a total of four (4) incubated brands – Jumpoff Jo, Brilliant Bee, Big Betty, and Domestic Corner.
 
Agency-as-a-Service (“AaaS”): Partner owns inventory. We sell it.
 In this model, Kaspien serves as an extension of a partner’s e-commerce team, providing full service in the areas of inventory management, marketing management, creative, brand control, compliance and other marketplace growth services. Kaspien charges a subscription fee and receives a percentage of the revenue generated.
 
Managed Service (“MS”): Partner owns inventory and sells it.
 In this model, Kaspien provides select AaaS services to its partner, such as FBA cost recovery or Amazon advertising management. Kaspien charges retainer and/or receives a percentage of the transaction.
    The “Agency as a Service” and “Managed Service” models are collectively called “Subscriptions.” The software products and tech-enabled services that form subscriptions are as follows:
 
• | Ad management
--+--------------


• | Brand protection and seller tracking
--+-------------------------------------


• | Cost recovery and case management
--+----------------------------------


• | Dropship automation
--+--------------------


• | Inventory management & supply chain
--+------------------------------------


• | Creative services
--+------------------

 
As of January 29, 2022, we had 925 total accounts across our portfolio of external brand partners, including over 600 active retail partners and 28 subscriptions partners.
    Technology and Integrations
 
The Company’s marketplace platform is a one stop shop, insights driven platform built on top of more than a decade of marketplace selling data. The platform includes a variety of artificial intelligence powered analysis solutions spanning across brand protection services, logistics and supply chain optimization, automated pricing, advertising marketing management, creative and content services, tax and compliance services, among others. This is all accessible through the Kaspien platform and can be leveraged through a managed service.
 
The platform uses an insight driven approach to digital marketplace retailing using both proprietary and licensed software. Using data collected from marketplaces, optimal inventory thresholds and purchasing trends are calculated within its advanced inventory management software developed in-house. Kaspien also leverages a combination of proprietary and licensed software related to pricing, advertisement management, marketplace seller tracking and channel auditing.
 
Additionally, the Kaspien platform can be extended to our business and service providers that are synergistic to Kaspien. This enables a network of partner integrations that can be extended and expanded upon. The Kaspien platform has formed strategic relationships and partnerships with these other listed marketplace service providers, including Deliverr and MyFBAPrep in the logistics and fulfillment space, TaxCloud, a tax services provider, VantageBP, a brand protection agency, Levin Consulting, an electronics specialty retailer, and others.
 
Business Environment
 Digital marketplaces allow consumers to shop from a variety of merchants in one place and have become an integral part of many brand manufacturers’ businesses.
    According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. e-commerce sales in 2021 were $870.8 billion, up +14.2% from 2020. While shoppers returned to physical stores in the back half of 2021 as COVID restrictions eased in various parts of the United States, many shoppers continued to rely on internet retailers for their consumer needs. As a result, e-commerce sales ended the year accounting 13.2% of total sales as compared to 13.6% of total in 2020.
 
In the United States, we sell on marketplaces that represent greater than 50% of national e-commerce visits and sales (including Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target.com, Google.com, Sears.com, jet.com, Pricefalls.com, Overstock.com, and Wish.com). Internationally, we sell on marketplaces in the U.K. (Amazon.uk), Germany (Amazon.de), Canada (Amazon.ca).
    Competition and Strategic Positioning
 Kaspien operates in a category within e-commerce called “Marketplace Growth Software and Services”. Businesses in this category provide services to brands and other sellers to facilitate growth on marketplaces. The market is very fragmented, and most providers are focused on a few focus areas where sellers have support needs. Subcategories in this market include Account and Marketing Services, Supply Chain and Logistics Providers, Manufacturers and Product Suppliers, Legal Services and Accounting, Tax and Financial Services. In the Account and Marketing Services subcategory, services are further divided into retail services and agency services. This is analogous to our business models – Retail as a Service, Agency as a Service and Managed Services.
 
Kaspien positions itself as a comprehensive and fully customizable offering of software and services tailored towards online marketplace growth. Kaspien’s core focus is on the Account and Marketing Services subcategory and competes in this subcategory with Software Providers, Agencies and Retailers.
 


Revenue Distribution
 Kaspien’s primary source of revenue is through its “Retail as a Service” business, specifically as a third-party seller on the Amazon US marketplace. Retail revenues represented 98.7% of total revenue in fiscal 2021 as compared to 99.2% in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, the share of our retail revenues generated from our Amazon US business was 94.4%, as compared to 94.6% in fiscal 2020. Our international retail business represented 3.9% of retail sales in fiscal 2021 compared to 4.9% in fiscal year 2020. The remaining retail revenue is generated from other marketplaces including Amazon International, Walmart, eBay and Target+.
 
Kaspien focuses on a broad array of categories, including pets and sporting goods, baby, tools / office / outdoor, health & personal care, and home / kitchen. In fiscal year 2021, these categories represented approximately 81% of our total revenue. Kaspien organizes our operations by category, developing a deep understanding and subject matter expertise in these areas, enabling us to drive better results across these categories.
 
Human Capital
  As of January 29, 2022, the Company employed approximately 141 full-time people. At the end of fiscal 2021, the Company had department heads in the areas of marketing, supply chain, private label, business development, account management, human resources, accounting, FP&A, warehouse operations, compliance, and technology. Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
 
The Company believes that its success depends on the ability to attract, develop, retain and incentivize our existing and new employees, consultants, and key personnel. It also believes that the skills, experience and industry knowledge of its key personnel significantly benefits its operations and performance. The principal purposes of equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to offer a best-in-class employee experience which ultimately increases shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.


Customer Acquisition

Kaspien utilizes content marketing to strengthen its visibility within the industry. Kaspien’s public relations efforts consist of press releases, articles in industry publications, and articles on its website to build its brand.
