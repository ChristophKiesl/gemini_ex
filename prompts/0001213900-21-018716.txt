Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing cellular therapies for specific aging-related and life-threatening conditions. Our lead investigational product is the LOMECEL-B™ cell-based therapy product (“Lomecel-B”), which is derived from culture-expanded medicinal signaling cells (MSCs) that are sourced from bone marrow of young healthy adult donors. We believe that by using the same cells that promote tissue repair, organ maintenance, and immune system function, we can develop safe and effective therapies for some of the most difficult disorders associated with the aging process.
 
We are currently sponsoring Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in the following indications: Aging Frailty, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the Metabolic Syndrome, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Our mission is to advance Lomecel-B and other cell-based product candidates into pivotal Phase 3 trials, with the goal of achieving regulatory approvals, subsequent commercialization and broad use by the healthcare community.
 
Our philosophy is that healthy aging can be improved through regenerative medicine approaches. Life expectancy has substantially increased over the past century as a result of medical and public health advancements. However, this increase in longevity has not been paralleled by the number of years a person is expected to live in relatively good health, free of chronic disease and disabilities of aging – a period known as healthspan. As we age, we experience: a profound decline in our own stem cells; a decrease in immune system function, known as immunosenescence; diminished blood vessel functioning; chronic inflammation, known as “inflammaging”; and other aging-related declines. Our clinical data suggest that Lomecel-B addresses these problems through multiple mechanisms of action, or MOAs, that simultaneously target key aging-related processes.
 
Improving healthspan is an imperative for governmental health agencies, and the NIA, an institute of the NIH, has promoted the concept of geroscience – the idea that aging itself is the biggest risk factor for aging-related human diseases. The geroscience hypothesis provides a strong rationale for the approach of treating underlying biological processes contributing to aging as a way to reduce disease burden and advance global human health. Our investments into developing and testing product candidates are aimed at reducing aging-related disease burden and improving healthspan.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our core business strategy is to become a world leading regenerative medicine company through the development and commercialization of novel cell therapy products for unmet medical needs, with emphasis on aging-related indications. Key elements of our business strategy are as follows.

● | Advance Lomecel-B and other regenerative medicine products to market. Our clinical trial execution capabilities represent one of our key core competencies; and since our founding in 2014, we have executed a robust clinical trials program. We are advancing Lomecel-B through proof-of-concept clinical studies to potentially later stage trials for the purpose of achieving commercialization in one or more indications. Our rigorously-designed studies throughout the clinical development process are intended to increase the likelihood of success of our programs, and to establish foundations for subsequent development and expansion into new areas. We will continue to leverage our technical and clinical expertise, and relationships with clinical investigators, treatment centers, and other key stakeholders, to explore new opportunities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our manufacturing capabilities to commercial-scale production. We operate a GMP-compliant manufacturing facility and produce our own product candidates for testing. We continue to improve and expand our capabilities with the goal of achieving cost-effective large-scale manufacturing to meet future commercial demand. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Non-dilutive funding. Our clinical programs have received over $16.0 million in competitive extramural grant awards ($11.9 million which has been directly awarded to us and which are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are met) from the NIH, Alzheimer’s Association, and MSCRF. These prestigious funding awards are non-dilutive and allow us to collaborate with state and federal partners in pursuing safe and effective therapeutics for disorders that have few, if any, available approved treatments. Each of our U.S. clinical trials has received grant support, and we will continue to pursue the strategy of obtaining non-dilutive funding. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to develop our existing international programs. We have selected Japan as our first non-U.S. territory for a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate Lomecel-B for Aging Frailty. We intend to explore other indications and other international locations for further development and commercialization. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Collaboration arrangements and out-licensing opportunities. We will be opportunistic and consider entering into co-development, out-licensing, commercialization or other collaboration agreements for the purpose of commercializing Lomecel-B and other products domestically and internationally. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Product candidate development pipeline through internal research and development, and in-licensing. Through our research and development program, and through strategic in-licensing agreements, we will add to our pipeline of product candidates. We are committed to developing safe and effective regenerative medicine products that address aging-related and other life-threatening unmet medical needs. 
● | Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. Our intellectual property is vitally important to our business strategy, and we take significant steps to develop this property and protect its value. Results from our ongoing research and development efforts are intended to add to our existing intellectual property portfolio. 

Clinical Development Pipeline
 
Since our founding in 2014, we have initiated six clinical studies under five U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) for the purpose of evaluating the safety and efficacy of Lomecel-B (See Figure 2). As of the first quarter of 2021, over 250 subjects have received Lomecel-B via peripheral intravenous infusion or direct injection, and there have been no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported that were considered related to the product candidate.

● | Aging Frailty. Aging Frailty is a recognized condition that disproportionately increases a patient’s risk for severely poor outcomes due to disease and injury, and is widely believed by geriatricians to be treatable, although no approved medical treatments currently exist. Aging Frailty presently does not have a consensus definition of the indication for regulatory purposes, and will therefore require additional clinical data and discussion with FDA and PMDA before conducting a pivotal trial and gaining marketing authorization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&cir; | We have two U.S. clinical trials ongoing under FDA IND 016644: (1) a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial (“Phase 2b Trial”) to assess whether Lomecel-B can improve physical function, reduce inflammation, and improve quality of life, among other endpoints, in Aging Frailty subjects; and (2) a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 trial (“HERA Trial”) to evaluate if Lomecel-B can be an effective vaccine adjuvant to improve immunity against influenza virus in Aging Frailty patients, who typically respond inadequately to vaccines. Data from both trials are expected in the third quarter of 2021. We have preliminary data from the HERA Trial (see “Aging Frailty Clinical Trials” on page 7 of this report).

&cir; | Japan Clinical Trial: The Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) has approved a Clinical Trial Notification (CTN), which is equivalent to a U.S. IND, allowing an Investigator-sponsored us to sponsor a Phase 2 clinical study for Aging Frailty subjects in Japan. We expect this trial to initiate in 2021. 
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&cir; | The Bahamas Registry Trial: We sponsor and operate a Registry Trial in Nassau, The Bahamas, where participants may receive Lomecel-B for Aging Frailty and other indications, at the participant’s own expense. Lomecel-B is designated as an investigational product in The Bahamas. 


● | Alzheimer’s Disease. AD is the leading cause of dementia, and there are no approved medications that can prevent, stop, or reverse the progression of the disease. We have completed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial under FDA IND 016524 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Lomecel-B in individuals with mild AD. The trial was also designed to explore efficacy in multiple assessment domains, including cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), quality of life (QOL), and biomarkers. Top-line results are reported in “Phase 1 Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Trial” on page 16 of this report, with the remaining results to be reported once the analysis is completed, which we expect will be in 2021. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Metabolic Syndrome. The Metabolic Syndrome is an insidious condition which, over the course of years to decades, leads to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type II diabetes mellitus (T2MD). There are no approved therapies for the Metabolic Syndrome, aside from symptomatic treatments. Under FDA IND 016644, we are conducting a sub-study to evaluate whether Lomecel-B may improve the symptoms of the Metabolic Syndrome, and the effects of this comorbidity on responses of Aging Frailty subjects to Lomecel-B. Top-line results are expected in the second half of 2021. The Metabolic Syndrome presently does not have an accepted consensus definition as an indication for regulatory purposes, and will therefore require additional clinical data and discussion with FDA before additional trials. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome due to Viral Infection. ARDS can result in both short-term severe consequences (e.g., prolonged and expensive hospitalization, and death), and long-term debilitating consequences (e.g., severe lung scarring and lung dysfunction). Older persons, those with Aging Frailty, and those with the Metabolic Syndrome are at exceptionally high risk for developing ARDS due to viral infection, as the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, in which 80% of deaths have occurred in older people. We are conducting a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial under FDA IND 019668 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lomecel-B for treating ARDS due to influenza or SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Both short- and long-term health consequences of ARDS due to viral infection disproportionately affect those with Aging Frailty and the Metabolic Syndrome—two prominent populations under study in our other trials. The trial is expected to complete enrollment in 2022. 
● | Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. We completed a multicenter, single arm, open label Phase 1 study under FDA IND 017677 to evaluate the safety and provisional efficacy of Lomecel-B as a combinatorial therapy to surgery for this ultra-rare heart condition. Babies born with this congenital condition have an underdeveloped left ventricle, and undergo multiple surgeries to prevent certain death. We believe that Lomecel-B may improve heart function and long-term clinical outcomes in these patients, who still have a very high early mortality rate despite the life-saving surgeries. Intramyocardial injection was found to be well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study, with no major adverse cardiac events reported, and additional safety and exploratory efficacy results expected in 2021. We anticipate treating the first patient in the Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2021. In March 2021 we received approval from US FDA to treat a baby with HLHS under an expanded access protocol, otherwise known as “compassionate use.” The baby received the treatment and follow up is ongoing. 

 
The first four indications are core to our geroscience approach for aging-related disorders (See Figure 3). While HLHS is a non-aging-related indication, it illustrates the broader potential for our cell-based therapy.

Clinical Trial Grant Funding and Partnerships
 
We have partnered with the NIA and NHLBI of NIH, the Alzheimer’s Association, and the MSCRF of Maryland TEDCO, to conduct our clinical trials.
 
Product Candidate Financial Overview
 
Since 2015, we have received approximately $56.1 million in equity financing, have been awarded approximately $16.0 million in non-dilutive grant funds for our programs ($11.9 million which has been directly awarded to us and which are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are met), and generated approximately $3.8 million in non-grant revenue, primarily from clinical trial revenue and strategic contract manufacturing agreements.
 
Lomecel-B for Aging-Related Indications: a Geroscience Approach
 
While the exact mechanisms of action of Lomecel-B, and MSCs in general, are still active areas of research, based on current evidence, we believe Lomecel-B can treat multiple facets of aging-related disorders simultaneously through multiple mechanisms of actions that include the following.
 

● | Reduce inflammation. A pro-inflammatory state is a common attribute among many aging-related disorders. Lomecel-B has the potential to reduce inflammation without leading to toxic immunosuppression, as well as the potential to promote activation of anti-inflammatory biochemical pathways. Broadly speaking, this includes reducing harmful pro-inflammatory proteins that negatively affect muscles, bones, and joints, as well as the brain (inflammation in the brain is called neuroinflammation). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Improve immune function. Lomecel-B has the potential to improve immune system function, such as the ability to make antibodies. 
● | Improve vascular function. Lomecel-B has the potential to improve overall functioning of the blood vessels (called the vasculature). The potential broad impact is to improve blood supply to the muscles, bones, and organs, including the brain (the neurovasculature), and thereby improve nutrient supply and waste removal.

● | Activate intrinsic repair and regenerative mechanisms. Intrinsic ability to regenerate and repair tissue declines with aging. Lomecel-B has the potential to stimulate these regenerative and repair pathways to promote recovery from damage and a more healthful state. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Home to sites of inflammation and damage. A well-known property of MSCs is that they are attracted to sites of inflammation and damage within the body. This property may be advantageous for treating aging-related diseases where the damage can be diffuse: by delivery into the blood (via intravenous infusion), Lomecel-B should more readily be able to home to these diffuse sites. 
● | Compensate for aging-related loss of MSCs. Lomecel-B may compensate for diminished MSC activity and numbers in the recipient, which are dramatically reduced as a function of aging. 

 
Biochemical Properties of Lomecel-B
 
The proposed mechanisms of action of Lomecel-B derive from intrinsic cellular features (See Figure 4). Lomecel-B cells secrete numerous proteins that include cytokines and growth factors, which are believed to be responsible for decreasing inflammation and promoting repair.
 
Lomecel-B also secretes exosomes, which are biochemically active membrane spheres (called vesicles) that carry cargo composed of proteins, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and other molecules. MSC exosomes have been found to include over a thousand proteins and hundreds of different RNAs that can have beneficial effects on numerous pathways. Using exosomes as a therapeutic is an emerging therapeutic principle that we are pursuing through our research and development.
 
Lomecel-B cells can also potentially regulate endogenous cells through actions that include direct cell-cell interactions that can allow for exchange of RNAs, proteins, and other cellular content between the cells through linkages called connexin-mediated gap-junctions. MSCs can also form tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) that allow for exchange of larger cytoplasmic content, including mitochondria (the energy-generating portions of cells). Such exchanges have been documented to occur between MSCs and neuronal stem cells, cardiomyocytes, corneal epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells, retinal ganglion cells, renal epithelial cells, and macrophages.
 
In the context of treating aging-related disorders, such exchange of mitochondria, proteins, RNA, and other cargo from Lomecel-B sourced from young donors may suggest cellular regenerative mechanisms for older cells of the recipient which have depleted mitochondria, reduced metabolic functioning, etc. In fact, mitochondria released from damaged cells appears to be a signal to induce regenerative mechanisms in MSCs, which can promote a desired shift in energy metabolism in the recipient cells.
 

Figure 4. Potential mechanisms of action of Lomecel-B. (1) Lomecel-B cells release growth factors and other proteins, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines. These have the potential to reduce inflammation, and stimulate nearby stem cells and other cells (called paracrine activity) to promote regenerative and repair responses. There is also potential for these factors to be released into the blood and work at a distance, called endocrine activity. (2) Lomecel-B cells also have the potential to engage in direct cell-cell interactions to induce positive pathways in contacted cells. (3) Lomecel-B cells release exosomes, which have cargo consisting of RNA, proteins, and other molecules that can be taken up by other cells to provide beneficial effects. (4) Lomecel-B cells also have the potential to form nanotube bridges or TNTs, which can allow the exchange of mitochondria and other cellular contents between cells.

Key Features and Potential Benefits of Lomecel-B
 
The key features of Lomecel-B offer potential benefits as a possible geroscience therapeutic, including the following:
 

● | “Off-the-Shelf” and scalable product. Lomecel-B is intended to be an “off-the-shelf” commercialized product that is stored frozen and available for on-demand use. To date, it has been safely administered without eliciting a rejection or allergic response from the recipient. This is because MSCs have unique properties that inhibit a graft rejection response. This property is also known as being immunoprivileged/immunoevasive, and thus Lomecel-B does not require tissue-type matching. Each lot of Lomecel-B is derived from a young, healthy, highly-screened donor, where the cells are present in relatively small quantities. Lomecel-B cells are then culture-expanded in vitro to produce orders of magnitude more cells, which are then cryopreserved and stored for future use. These are advantages over autologous cell therapy interventions, which involve removing cells from an individual through an operative procedure, and then reintroducing the cells back into the same person, sometimes after weeks of culture expansion. Accordingly, autologous approaches lack economies of scale since they serve only a single patient. In our clinical trials, Lomecel-B is administered through intravenous infusion in under one hour on an outpatient basis, or via direct tissue injection, depending upon the indication. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enduring effects. Our clinical data suggests that the effects of a single dose of Lomecel-B may last over 6 months. This is consistent with previous studies showing human MSCs can persist for months in immunocompetent hosts, thereby helping support the potential duration of effect. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Young phenotype. The starting raw material source for Lomecel-B is young healthy adult donors. Such sourced cells can provide significantly higher potency over similarly prepared autologous MSCs (i.e., sourced from a person they will be given back to). In the context of aging-related conditions, autologous MSCs can be impaired by advanced age and/or patient co-morbidity. Relative to young adults, MSCs from older adults have reduced regenerative potential, as indicated by: diminished proliferative capacity; diminished differentiation potential; increased senescence; increased expression of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-break repair genes; altered DNA-methylation and gene-expression patterns; impaired migration; altered expression of microRNAs and cell-surface markers; and diminished anti-inflammatory activity. The sourcing and manufacturing of Lomecel-B are designed to minimize these confounding issues. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Safe and consistent manufacturing. Lomecel-B manufacturing is performed in our facility using cGMP-compliant processes. The donors used for sourcing Lomecel-B undergo rigorous screening to ensure safety, including screening for communicable diseases and illicit drug use that exceed federal guidelines. Throughout the production process, the cells are analyzed according to pre-established criteria to ensure that a consistent, well-characterized, safe product candidate is produced. 
● | Well-tolerated and with minimal adverse side-effects. Lomecel-B has thus far in our clinical trials shown to be well-tolerated. Over 250 subjects have received Lomecel-B, and no SAEs have been reported that were considered related to the product candidate. This is consistent with published reports indicating that allogeneic MSCs appear safe and well-tolerated, and do not lead to malignant tumor formation. 
● | Support for efficacy from early clinical trial data. As described above and supported by our clinical results, Lomecel-B has multiple potential MOAs that can potentially address broad aging-related disorders. This has potential advantages over small molecule drugs and biologics that have highly-specific targeting. 
● | Potency, identity, and efficacy assays. We are developing these assays for Lomecel-B as part of our early-stage trials, for validation in our pivotal Phase 3 trials. These assays are important steps required by FDA prior to product approval and are needed to qualitatively identify and quantitatively measure biological activity of the product candidate. 

Our Aging Frailty Research Program
 
Aging Frailty is a clinically-defined and extreme form of unsuccessful aging. It is readily recognized by the hallmark signs of weakness, slowness, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and low activity. Those with Aging Frailty are disproportionately compromised in their ability to cope with every day and acute stressors, are at high vulnerability to disease and injury, have lowered tolerance to medications, and are at high risk for poor outcomes and death after surgery. Even normally “minor” insults (e.g., minor infection) can have devastating consequences, and lead to a spiral of decline to debility in these patients.
 
The necessity for identifying patients with Aging Frailty is well-acknowledged in the geriatric community, and the treatment of Aging Frailty and promotion of healthful aging are recognized priorities of the National Academy of Medicine and NIA/NIH. Despite the pressing need for interventions, there are no FDA-approved therapies that can slow down, reverse, or prevent Aging Frailty.

Biological Underpinnings of Aging Frailty
 
Aging Frailty is a multifaceted biologically-driven process that is distinct from normal aging. While all of the biological mechanisms underlying frailty are still being elucidated, it is thought to involve a low-level chronic pro-inflammatory state referred to as inflammaging. This loss of control over inflammation can be attributed to an imbalance between levels of inflammatory promoters and anti-inflammatory mediators, as well as diminished capacity to restore equilibrium once an inflammatory stimulus has subsided. The ultimate result is measurable elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and diminished anti-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10). In particular, serum TNF-α positively correlates to Aging Frailty severity.
 
Inflammation can contribute to the physical decline in Aging Frailty through multiple mechanisms, including detrimental effects on muscles, bone tissue, the immune system, cardiovascular function, and cognition. In muscle cells, pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α stimulate catabolic biochemical pathways that break down muscle tissue, which can explain the clinically observed atrophy, decreased strength and endurance, and increased exhaustion seen in Aging Frailty. Inflammation can also severely diminish immune system function, and accelerate the aging-related decline in the immune system, known as immunosenescence. This ultimately leads to an immune system that is hyporesponsive, making these patients highly vulnerable to disease and cancer.
 
Aging Frailty (and aging in general) is also characterized by reductions in the number and function of circulating MSCs. Therefore, treatments that can positively affect and/or replenish these endogenous stem cell functions could be of therapeutic value for Aging Frailty.
 
The culmination of these organ system declines can explain the common clinical manifestations of Aging Frailty, such as sarcopenia and cachexia, and forms the basis for the resulting heightened vulnerability to injury, disease, adverse health outcomes, and mortality.
 
Lomecel-B for the Potential Treatment of Aging Frailty
 
We are evaluating Lomecel-B as a therapy for Aging Frailty because the potential mechanisms of action may suitably address many of the features and underpinnings of this condition. Foremost, Lomecel-B has the potential to reduce inflammation associated with Aging Frailty, and to promote an anti-inflammatory state by releasing anti-inflammatory molecules, which can promote physiological restoration to a more normal state. As our early clinical data show, Lomecel-B may be able to improve aspects of physical functioning, as well as immune function.
 
Market Potential.
 
U.S. leading geriatricians and epidemiologists from Johns Hopkins University estimate approximately 15% of community-dwelling individuals 65 years and older in the U.S. have Aging Frailty. Another 45% are considered at risk for becoming frail, or “pre-frail”. These equate to 8.1 million and 24.3 million people, respectively. By 2035, the number of individuals with Aging Frailty is projected to reach over 11.4 million. Those with Aging Frailty are disproportionately high consumers of healthcare resources with potentially crippling economic consequences. Developing treatments for this unmet medical need is a priority for many single-payor healthcare systems
 
Japan is considered a “super-aged” society, with approximately 28% of its population over the age of 65. Aging Frailty and pre-Aging Frailty prevalence estimates for community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and older are 7.4% and 48.1%, respectively. Based on a 65 and older population of 35.9 million, this translates to approximately 2.65 million Aging Frailty patients in Japan.
 
Aging Frailty Clinical Trials
 
We are currently conducting two multicenter trials in the U.S. for Aging Frailty, have received Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) approval to conduct a Phase 2 Aging Frailty clinical trial in Japan, and have government approval to use Lomecel-B for Aging Frailty participants in a Registry Trial that is actively enrolling in The Bahamas (See Figure 5). We are the only company that we are aware of that is developing an allogeneic cell therapy for Aging Frailty.

U.S. Phase 2b Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Trial
 
The Phase 2b Trial is our most advanced clinical trial in our Aging Frailty program (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT03169231). The trial was completed in Q1 2021, and we expect to announce top-line data in Q3 2021. The trial design was guided by input from FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and Longeveron’s scientific and clinical advisors. Longeveron has designated this as a “Phase 2b” trial because its objectives include a preliminary assessment of Lomecel-B effectiveness. Longeveron did not conduct a “Phase 2a” trial.
 
The specific objectives of this trial are to evaluate the effectiveness of Lomecel-B in multiple domain measures of Aging Frailty: physical functioning biomarkers; patient-reported outcomes (PROs); quality-of-life measures (QOLs); frailty status; and clinical outcomes and other endpoints applicable to Aging Frailty. In addition, this trial will assess a dose-range of Lomecel-B and add further to our understanding of the safety and efficacy profile of this product candidate. The target population comprises 70–85-year-old individuals with mild to moderate Aging Frailty, and systemic inflammation evidenced by elevated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).
 
The primary efficacy endpoint in this clinical trial is the change from baseline in the six-minute walk test (6MWT) at six months for Lomecel-B subjects compared to placebo subjects. The 6MWT is a commonly used assessment of physical function, and has been used as the primary endpoint of clinical benefit for a number of FDA-approved products. The results of our Aging Frailty trials will be evaluated, and depending on the data, discussed with FDA to determine a regulatory pathway to pivotal clinical trial(s). These discussions would include evaluation of what may be an acceptable and appropriate primary efficacy endpoint(s), in an approvable indication. In lieu of long-term clinical outcomes (e.g., reduction in falls, fractures, hospitalizations, debilitations, and deaths) as endpoints requiring large expensive long trials, the U.S. FDA has indicated that the 6MWT could be a suitable endpoint as part of a co-primary or composite primary endpoint in this indication, if included with a validated PRO and a suitable biomarker, for example, but this will depend on the data, further discussion and other considerations.
 
Trial Status. This Phase 2b Trial is Complete and we anticipate reporting data in the third quarter of 2021.
 
Grant Funding Award. This study was supported by a grant award from the NIA/NIH.
 
U.S. Phase 1/2 HERA Trial: Lomecel-B as a Potential Vaccine Adjuvant
 
The aging-related diminution of the immune system (immunosenescence) makes Aging Frailty patients vulnerable to infection and disease. Immunosenescence is the basis for a generally muted response to any type of immune challenge in these patients, including disproportionately low response to vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine.
 
Many efforts are made to try to boost vaccine effectiveness by manipulation of the vaccines themselves, such as increasing vaccine dosage in the case of the High-Dose Flu Vaccine given to older recipients. However, this approach often falls short of providing the sought-after immune protection because of the patients’ diminished intrinsic ability to mount an effective immune response and furthermore, may be associated with increased incidence of adverse events. To date, there are no approved therapeutics shown to improve the intrinsic competence of the immune system (immunocompetence). However, as supported by our preliminary data, Lomecel-B may be a candidate for improving immunocompetence.
 
The HERA Trial was designed to evaluate whether Lomecel-B can improve immune response to influenza vaccine, and to evaluate Lomecel-B’s possible effects on Aging Frailty status and endpoints (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02982915).

Trial Status. We have completed Phase 1, and all subject visits have been completed for Phase 2. Top-line are expected in the third quarter of 2021. Phase 1 was a 22-patient multicenter, open-label, randomized trial. Phase 2 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Lomecel-B has been well-tolerated in all trials to date, and no product-related adverse events have been reported.
 
Grant Funding Award. This study was supported in part by a grant award from the MSCRF, part of Maryland TEDCO.
 
HERA Aging Frailty Preliminary Results. At the approximate mid-point of Phase 2 of the HERA Trial, we performed a planned interim analysis in order to re-assess study powering. We evaluated the 6MWT and other physical function measures of Aging Frailty as part of this analysis. The 6MWT is also the primary efficacy endpoint of our larger Phase 2b Aging Frailty trial.
 
The 6MWT is a functional assessment that engages several organ systems, is a reliable indicator of frailty status, and may correlate with an individual’s ability to perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs). This validated and easily-administered test measures how many meters a person can walk in six minutes, and integrates multiple physiological systems for strength, mobility, and endurance. The HERA Phase 2 interim analysis showed that the 6MWT increased in the Lomecel-B arm by 45.20 ± 81.03 meters (n=14) at six months post-administration, versus a decrease of 21.40 ± 81.87 meters (n=15) in the placebo arm (mean ± standard deviation; six-month difference from placebo: 66.60 meters. 95%CI: -4.70 – 137.89. p = 0.0656). A similar trend was seen in the open-label HERA Phase 1 (59.59 ± 140.57 meters. 95%CI: -12.68 – 131.86. n=19. p=0.0996). We performed a combined analysis using the Lomecel-B arms from Phase 1 and the Phase 2 interim analysis Lomecel-B arms, versus the placebo arm of the interim analysis (Figure 6). At six months post-infusion, there was a significant improvement in the combined Lomecel-B arm relative to Baseline (six-month difference from placebo: 75.65 meters. 95%CI: 0.71 – 150.60. p=0.0480). By 12 months post-infusion, the improvements had waned in the Lomecel-B groups (Phase 1, Phase 2 interim analysis, and combined), and were no longer significantly different from Baseline (12-month difference from placebo: 35.31 meters. 95%CI: -16.99 – 87.61. p=0.1796).
 
The HERA Phase 2 interim analysis also showed a trending, but not significant, improvement in the Lomecel-B group on the short physical performance battery (SPPB) relative to placebo. The SPPB is used to evaluate lower body function and balance, and consists of three assessment domains (balance, gait speed, and chair stand). All three domains showed similar trending improvements. The other physical function measures – the Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) and hand-grip strength – showed minimal changes for Lomecel-B (both within group and relative to baseline).
 

Figure 6. 6MWT improved in Lomecel-B administered subjects, but not placebo-treated subjects. For this analysis, data were combined from HERA Phase 1 and from a HERA Phase 2 planned interim analysis. The Phase 2 study is still ongoing, so the interim analysis entailed only study group analyses of select endpoints to maintain the blind (individual patient data remains blinded). Plotted are the mean ± SEM. *, p < 0.05.

HERA Immune-Response Results. Phase 1 of the HERA Trial was an open-label study conducted during the 2017 – 2018 flu season. The primary goal was to evaluate the safety of Lomecel-B as a vaccine adjuvant, and evaluate whether a short (1 week) or longer (4 week) interval between Lomecel-B infusion and vaccination impacted the immune response. Subjects enrolled had mild to moderate Aging Frailty, and received the Fluzone High-Dose Vaccine.
 
All subjects of this Phase received Lomecel-B, and showed significant positive antibody responses as determined by the blood levels of IgM and IgG antibodies raised against influenza A and B strains. IgM antibodies appear early in a normal immune response, and are normally followed by IgG antibodies which appear later. Antibody levels ≥ 1.1 index value (IV) indicate positive antibody response. Figure 7 shows IgM antibodies raised against influenza A virus, and is representative of the IgM and IgG responses against both influenza A and B strains. IgM levels prior to receiving vaccine were < 1.1 IV at the Infusion Visit and Vaccination Visit, where blood samples were taken prior to Lomecel-B administration and vaccination, respectively. Post-vaccination, these increased to > 1.1 IV in every subject for all four antibodies (IgG and IgM for influenza A and B viruses). These increases did not significantly differ between the two study arms (1-week and 4-week interval between Lomecel-B infusion and vaccination).
 
We also examined potential to neutralize the specific influenza virus strains that the vaccine was directed against (Michigan, Hong Kong, and Brisbane viruses). This used a test called the hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assay. Overall, the 1-week interval group showed significantly higher HAI results (meaning better performance) compared to the 4-week interval group. Based on these preliminary findings, we elected to use a 1-week interval between infusion with Lomecel-B and vaccination in Phase 2 of HERA. This study is ongoing, with expected unblinding in the second half of 2021.
 
We view these results as encouraging, in light of the reported suboptimal efficacy of the 2017 – 2018 Fluzone High-Dose Vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) found an overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) of just 18% against flu-associated medically-attended acute respiratory illness in those ≥ 65 years of age (CI = -25–47%).
 
The cumulative Phase 1 and 2 results from our HERA Trial suggest that Lomecel-B has the potential to improve physical function and immune response, supporting the concept of Lomecel-B as a geroscience product candidate.

Japanese Phase 2 Aging Frailty Trial.
 
We have advanced our clinical initiative in Japan with the objective of capitalizing on the country’s progressive regulatory framework, which has legislation designed specifically to accelerate promising regenerative medicine therapeutics to market. In 2020, the PMDA approved an investigator-initiated Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) application for a multicenter Phase 2 clinical study of Lomecel-B infusion in older Japanese subjects with mild to moderate Aging Frailty. The trial is similar in design to our ongoing U.S. Phase 2b Trial, and is expected to begin in 2021. The CTN applicant is the National Center for Geriatrics (NCGG) and Gerontology, and we are engaged in trial planning with the NCGG and Juntendo University Hospital, as the other clinical trial site.
 
Under the 2014 law passed by the Japanese government, two new Acts were added that regulate regenerative medicine development and offer two pathways to market for regenerative medicine product candidates: The Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine (ASRM) and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Act (PMD Act). A summary of the primary differences and benefits of the two Acts is described in “Japanese Laws and Regulations” on page 34 of this report.
 
The Bahamas Registry Trial.
 
In 2017, we were granted approval by the Bahamian government to sponsor a Registry Trial in Nassau, The Bahamas. Eligible subjects with Aging Frailty who meet Registry eligibility requirements may receive Lomecel-B at their own expense at one of two medical centers with which we are partnered. The medical providers are responsible for the administration of Lomecel-B to these individuals as well as their care and Registry Trial-specific follow-up. The program is regulated by the Stem Cell Research and Therapy Act of 2013, and the Stem Cell Research and Therapy Regulations passed in 2014. Under the terms of the approval, participants in the Registry pay a fee directly to us, and we in turn pay a fee to the medical providers who administer Lomecel-B to the participant. Data collected from the Registry Trial contribute to our overall understanding of the safety profile of Lomecel-B, and for gathering real-world evidence on possible efficacy. Lomecel-B is not licensed for commercial sale in the Bahamas and is considered an investigational therapeutic.
 
In 2019, we received approval to expand the Registry for the following indications: mild cognitive impairment; AD and related dementias; frailty due to reasons other than aging, including overuse and injury; and osteoarthritis.
 
The Registry Trial has specified baseline assessments and a prescribed follow up schedule over a 12-month post-administration time period. Participants are expected to follow up with their local physician at the specified time points so that we may collect safety data and gain additional efficacy information, specifically with respect to physical function, the individual’s global impressions of change, biomarkers, and other indication-specific measures.
 
Participation in the Registry Trial has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to travel restrictions. Starting on July 22, 2020, the Bahamian government halted travel from the U.S. into The Bahamas, which resulted in the temporary cessation of participation in The Bahamas Registry Trial. While this travel restriction has now been lifted, participation in the Bahamas Registry Trial remains lower than anticipated, due in part to pandemic-related effects on international travel.
 
Lomecel-B for Alzheimer’s Disease
 
AD is the leading form of dementia. This disease affects millions of Americans, leads to early mortality, and creates a tremendous burden on families and society that costs the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars annually in direct costs and lost productivity.
 
Patients afflicted with AD have characteristic brain changes that include abnormal protein deposits in the brain, called β-amyloid deposits. Another feature that occurs within the neurons themselves is called neurofibrillary tangles, which interferes with the structure and function of the neurons, and leads to neuron death. Inflammation in the brain – a process called neuroinflammation – is also a key feature of AD. This pro-inflammatory state appears essential for the clinical manifestation of dementia resulting from AD. In addition to affecting the brain tissue itself, neuroinflammation also impairs the blood vessels in the brain and the exchange barrier between the blood and the brain, called the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Ultimately, these pathological processes lead to the structural changes in the brain and resulting dementia.
    Despite decades of research, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have not succeeded in developing a safe and effective FDA-approved treatment that can prevent, slow-down, or reverse the progression of AD. Many of these failed investigational drugs narrowly target just one aspect of AD, such as β-amyloid deposits. The five currently approved drugs for AD provide only partial symptomatic relief, but do not treat disease progression. We believe reasons for these failures include the inability of these other approaches to treat multiple pathological aspects of AD, and the inability to promote regenerative responses, which is highly muted in the brain.
 
11

 

We are testing Lomecel-B as a potential treatment for AD based on the hypothesis that its multiple possible MOAs can simultaneously address multiple features of AD. Preclinical studies show that MSCs can potentially reduce AD-associated brain inflammation, improve the function of blood vessels in the brain, and reduce brain damage due to AD progression, and promote regenerative responses. We have completed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 safety study of subjects with mild AD. Based on preliminary results, we intend to initiate a larger Phase 2 study. If successful in clinical studies, we hope that Lomecel-B may prove to be a disease-modifying therapy for AD.
 
Prevalence of AD and Market Potential. The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that 5.7 million Americans have AD, and as many as 14 million Americans will be afflicted by 2050 barring significant medical breakthroughs. An estimated 35.6 million people are affected with AD worldwide, and that number is expected to quadruple by 2050. Among individuals age 85 and older, half have AD. AD is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., taking more lives annually than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, underscoring the critical importance for developing a therapeutic intervention that can delay or reverse the progression of the disease. Arguably, AD represents the only leading cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed using existing approved therapies. This disease has a tremendous impact on the quality of lives of the patients and their caregivers, costing American society an estimated $240 billion annually.
 
Analysts have suggested that any disease-modifying AD drug that makes it all the way to market could rapidly achieve over $10 billion in sales. Without a major market competitor, analysts have predicted that that figure could balloon to over $20 billion by 2030.
 
Phase 1 Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Trial.
 
We have conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial using a single infusion of Lomecel-B in subjects with mild AD (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02600130). The observation period was 12 months post-infusion. Our results support the safety and tolerability of using Lomecel-B in individuals with AD, in which there have been no product-associated SAEs.
 
Results from the AD Phase 1 Trial.
 
While this Phase 1 study was powered for safety as the primary endpoint, it was also designed to evaluate the effects of Lomecel-B in multiple efficacy domains that include cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), quality-of-life (QOL), and biomarkers.
 
The Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a validated and commonly used assessment of cognitive function, in which decreasing scores indicate worsening. Statistically significant differences in the mean MMSE score were found between the Lomecel-B and placebo groups (Figure 8). The placebo group showed a steady worsening in the MMSE (p < 0.05 at 3-, 9- and 12-months post-treatment versus baseline). However, the rate of decline in the Lomecel-B group after treatment was slower, reaching statistical significance at post-treatment month 9 (difference from placebo: p = 0.0403; 95%CI: 0.16 – 6.38). While other cognitive assessments (“AD Assessment Scale – Cognitive” and the “Trail Making Test”) showed no significant differences between the Lomecel-B and placebo groups, the Lomecel-B group showed trending improvements relative to the placebo group.
 


Figure 8. Impact of Lomecel-B on cognitive performance in patients with mild AD. The MMSE showed a steady decline (lowered score) in the placebo group (red). The Lomecel-B group (blue) showed only a slight decline, which was statistically significant at 9-months after the treatment. The gray-box indicates the MMSE inclusion score of 18 – 24 required for enrollment on the trial. Plotted are means ± SEM. *, p < 0.05 for change in Lomecel-B arm versus placebo.

The subjects that received Lomecel-B showed on average no change in the ADCS-ADL, whereas the placebo group showed a significant decline (decreased score) (six-month difference from placebo: 95% CI 2.26 – 13.67). The ADCS-ADL is an assessment given to the patient caregiver, and provides an independent evaluation of how the AD patient is progressing. No significant differences between the Lomecel-B and placebo arms were found in quality-of-life (QOL) measures.
 

Figure 9. Impact of Lomecel-B on ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) in patients with mild AD. The ADCS-ADL showed a declined (lowered score) in the placebo group while the Lomecel-B group showed a slight improvement. These differences were statistically significant at 6-months after the infusion. Plotted are means ± SEM. **, p < 0.01 for change in Lomecel-B arm versus placebo.
 
Quarterly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans were performed on each subject to evaluate safety, as well as efficacy via brain structure changes. No adverse imaging brain changes were noted, supporting the potential safety of Lomecel-B for patients with mild AD.
 
Automated image analysis of the MRI scans was used to obtain unbiased measurements of brain structures (Figure 10). One of these structures, the hippocampus, is a brain region critical for memory formation, is one of the two major brain regions that undergoes rapid constant neuron replacement (the other region being the olfactory bulb), and undergoes significant atrophy (shrinking) in Alzheimer’s disease. Over the first 6 months post-treatment, the hippocampus on both sides of the brain showed trending but not significant size decreases in the placebo group, while the Lomecel-B-treated group did not. At month 6, this divergence reached significance in the left hippocampus between the placebo group and those treated with Lomecel-B at a 100 million cell dose (p = 0.0396; 95% CI 29.7 – 1044.8 mm3). These results are consistent with a proposed mechanism of action that Lomecel-B may stimulate intrinsic neuronal stem cells and regenerative mechanisms, thereby leading to increased volume of the hippocampus. Many brain regions did not show significant changes over the follow-up period. Nevertheless, it is possible that the changes observed in the imaging may be associated with the improvements in cognitive function.
 
Grant Funding Award. This trial is being supported in part by two competitive grants from the Alzheimer’s Association.
 
Next Steps. We are still evaluating final results from the Phase 1 trial but are preparing and planning for the next phase trial, which is expected to be a larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial intended to explore the effects of multiple doses of Lomecel-B in subjects with AD.

F and G, Hippocampal size changes after treatment with placebo or a single 100 million cell dose (100M) of Lomecel-B. At 6 months post-treatment, the left hippocampus showed a mean decrease in size in the placebo group that was statistically significantly different from the Lomecel-B group, which remained relatively unchanged. The right hippocampus showed a similar trend, but the difference was not statistically significant. Plotted are means ± SEM. *, p < 0.05 for Month 6 Lomecel-B versus placebo group.
 
Lomecel-B for the Metabolic Syndrome
 
We have an ongoing Phase 1 sub-study exploring whether Lomecel-B can improve the Metabolic Syndrome, and if the Metabolic Syndrome presents confounding issues for this treatment approach in Aging Frailty patients. This sub-study primarily focuses upon blood-based biomarker changes, and non-invasive evaluation of vascular (blood vessel) functioning.
 
The Metabolic Syndrome is a clinically-defined condition (ICD-10: code 277.7) that increases the chances of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is also known as X syndrome, insulin resistance syndrome, cardiometabolic syndrome, and Reaven’s syndrome. The Metabolic Syndrome is defined as a cluster of risk factors for which at least three of the following five criteria must be met.
 

● | Elevated serum triglycerides. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
● | Reduced high-density lipoprotein (good cholesterol). 

 
14

 


● | Elevated blood pressure. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Elevated fasting glucose. 
● | Increased waist circumference (central or apple-shaped obesity). 

 
The Metabolic Syndrome is associated with vascular dysfunction and damage, and a proinflammatory state marked by elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and D-dimer. Obesity also directly contributes to this proinflammatory state and the Metabolic Syndrome.
 
Compared to unaffected individuals, patients with the Metabolic Syndrome are twice as likely to develop CVD in 5 – 10 years, five-times as likely for developing T2DM, over twice as likely to have a stroke, over three-times as likely to have a heart attack, and have double the risk of dying from such events.
 
The incidence of the Metabolic Syndrome has reached epidemic proportions and continues to increase, as the overall prevalence in the U.S. is approximately 35% of the total population, or over 80 million individuals.
 
Lomecel-B may be a potential candidate for the Metabolic Syndrome through multiple potential mechanisms of action that include the potential to reduce associated inflammation and improve vascular function. Preclinical studies support the clinical benefits of allogeneic MSC therapy for treating the Metabolic Syndrome, which resulted in improvements in vascular function, atherosclerosis, and glucose homeostasis.
 
For the purpose of analysis, we are evaluating the Metabolic Syndrome in subjects who have been enrolled in our Phase 2b Trial and HERA Trial, and dividing them into two groups: those with and without the Metabolic Syndrome. We will look at the effect of Lomecel-B relative to placebo on the two groups with respect to effect changes relevant to the Metabolic Syndrome. Forty percent of Aging Frailty patients have been reported to have the Metabolic Syndrome, which we have empirically confirmed from our Phase 2b Trial and HERA clinical trial, in which we have identified approximately 45% and 33% of enrolled subjects, respectively, who meet the criteria for the Metabolic Syndrome. The Metabolic Syndrome is also becoming a well-recognized contributor to AD and related dementias.
 
Grant Funding Award. This study was being supported in part by a grant award from the NIA/NIH.
 
Lomecel-B for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
 
We are conducting a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial for ARDS due to COVID-19 or influenza virus infection.
 
ARDS can be rapidly induced by a variety of insults, such as coronavirus and influenza virus infection. Approximately 200,000 people suffer from ARDS in the U.S. annually, with a mortality rate of about 40%. These numbers are likely to dramatically increase as a result of COVID-19, which could become a seasonal epidemic. Older persons, those with Aging Frailty, and those with the Metabolic Syndrome, are at significantly increased risk for severely poor outcomes from ARDS due to viral infection, including prolonged hospitalization and death.
 
Viral infection leading to ARDS can results in severe inflammation called a “cytokine storm”, most pronounced by severely elevated serum levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). This in turn leads to disruption of the lung cell layers (the endothelial and epithelial barriers), and consequently, to severe inhibition of pulmonary exchange. ARDS can result in long-term adverse effects on patients, such as lung scarring (fibrosis). As now widely appreciated due to COVID-19, there is a dearth of treatment options available for ARDS, and first-line defense measures often have sub-optimal palliative effects.
 
Lomecel-B has the potential to be a treatment for ARDS due to the previously described mechanisms of action. These include the potential to treat the cytokine storm induced in ARDS without leading to toxic immunosuppression, reduce fibrotic damage, promote reparative mechanisms, and improve immune functioning.
 
Status of Clinical Trial. This trial is currently enrolling and we expect the trial to complete enrollment in 2022.
 
Grant Funding Award. This study is being supported in part by a grant award from the MSCRF, part of Maryland TEDCO.
 
Emergency Use Expanded Access. In addition to our clinical trial, we have treated patients with ARDS with Lomecel-B under FDA emergency-use expanded-access. The two patients treated had severe ARDS, were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and failed to respond to other attempted interventions. One of these patients responded after being given three doses of Lomecel-B. The other died shortly after being given a single dose of Lomecel-B.

Lomecel-B for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)
 
We are testing Lomecel-B as a potential combinatorial therapy candidate to surgical intervention for HLHS. The scientific goal underlying this study builds on surgical advances of the past thirty years, and is intended to address remaining obstacles to improving long-term cardiac function in HLHS patients.
 
HLHS is a severe congenital birth defect in which the left ventricle of the heart is either severely underdeveloped or missing. As a consequence, babies born with this condition have severely diminished systemic blood flow, which previously used to lead to a 100% mortality rate shortly after birth. Babies born with HLHS now undergo a complex three stage heart reconstruction over the course of years, in which the single remaining right ventricle is used to support systemic circulation (the right ventricle is normally used for lung circulation, which is a much lower load). While these children can now live into adulthood, early mortality is still extremely high in this population due to right ventricle failure, which is not meant for the increased load demanded for systemic circulation. Furthermore, HLHS patients after undergoing heart reconstructive surgery are often not ideal candidates for a heart transplant. As such, there is an important unmet medical need to improve right ventricular function in these patients to improve both short-term and long-term outcomes.
 
We believe that Lomecel-B has potential as a combinatorial therapy with HLHS surgery to improve both short- and long-term clinical outcomes. We are evaluating whether a direct injection in the heart can improve right ventricle function by promoting regenerative and repair responses. In animal studies, this combinatorial approach resulted in a 10 – 15% improvement in right ventricle function.
 
Prevalence of HLHS. HLHS is an ultra-rare indication, occurring at approximately 2 – 3 cases per 10,000 live births, or roughly 1,000 children annually in the U.S. This indication would therefore meet the prevalence requirements for an orphan drug designation (ODD) if the other designation requirements are met. A sponsor may request an ODD any time before the marketing application for the product for the rare disease or condition is submitted. If we request an ODD for Lomecel-B, which we have not yet done, and if FDA approves Lomecel-B for HLHS, then it may be eligible for a period of orphan drug exclusivity (ODE). A determination as to whether HLHS qualifies as a “rare disease or condition” will be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances as of the date the request for ODD is made. We may also have the opportunity to pursue one of the FDA’s expedited review programs for the use of Lomecel-B in HLHS. We have not sought expedited review from the FDA.
 
Status of the Clinical Trial. We have completed a 10-patient multicenter, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial in HLHS. Children with HLHS undergoing Stage 2 surgery were treated via intramyocardial (direct heart) injection of Lomecel-B. No major adverse cardiac events or Lomecel-B-related adverse events have been reported on trial, supporting the potential safety and tolerability of this approach. Additional safety and exploratory efficacy data are expected in the second quarter of 2021. Phase 2 of this study, which will be randomized, controlled, double-blinded design, is anticipated to treat the first patient in the second half of 2021.
 
Grant Funding Award. The Phase 1 study was supported by a grant award from the MSCRF, part of Maryland TEDCO. Phase 2 is being supported by the NHLBI/NIH.
 
Expanded Access. In addition to the clinical trial, we have treated one HLHS baby with Lomecel-B under FDA expanded access, or “compassionate use” approval. The patient was treated in March 2021 and follow up is ongoing.
 
Other Investigational Products in Development
 
We have been conducting preclinical research and development work for a next-generation cellular therapy product referred to as CD271+ cells. While similar to Lomecel-B, CD271+ cells may have characteristics that could lead to a more potent product and may have additional uses. We intend to enter into early-stage clinical testing of this product candidate.
Manufacturing
 
The manufacture and delivery of cell therapy products to patients involves complex, integrated processes. Commercial success in this area requires manufacturing processes that are reliable, scalable, and economical. We have and will continue to devote significant resources to process development and manufacturing to optimize process robustness and success rates in developing Lomecel-B and other potential product candidates, as well as to reduce per-unit manufacturing costs and enable us to quickly achieve regional and global scale production upon regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
 
We currently operate a manufacturing site in Miami, FL, which supplies Lomecel-B for our clinical trials and also serves as our corporate headquarters. We also intend to expand the manufacturing capacities in the U.S. and potentially Japan or other regions in Asia for commercialization at both a regional and global scale upon regulatory approvals.
 
Our cell manufacturing facility went online in early 2017, and consists of 4,150 ft2 (385.5 m2) of GMP space, with approximately 3,000 ft2 (279 m2) of cleanrooms and 1,150 ft2 (107 m2) of warehouse and Quality Control space. The cleanroom area is used exclusively for processing of human cellular and tissue products for use in clinical trials and research. We have validated the facility according to FDA regulations in 21 C.F.R. Part 210 (GMPs for drugs), Part 211 (GMPs for finished pharmaceuticals), Part 606 (GMPs for blood and blood components) and Part 610 (general biological products standards).

Our lead product, Lomecel-B, consists of human allogeneic bone-marrow derived MSCs as the active ingredient. These cells undergo cultured-expansion using proprietary processes, and are then formulated, packaged and stored frozen (cryopreserved) until shortly before use. Fresh bone marrow is procured from established, licensed U.S.-based third-party tissue suppliers, which harvest the tissue from young, healthy consenting donors. Lomecel-B is produced using techniques that FDA has reviewed and authorized as part of our INDs. We currently have bone marrow supply contracts in place with two suppliers: the Oklahoma Blood Institute and Vista Health Research. These suppliers provide adequate bone marrow for our current and anticipated needs, however if one or both suppliers were to no longer provide bone marrow, alternate suppliers would be needed otherwise this could impact our ability to produce Lomecel-B in the future.
 
Technology Capabilities
 
From the commencement of operations in 2014, we recognized the potential for cellular therapy to be a novel therapeutic candidate in our chosen indications. We have assembled a team of experts and proprietary technologies that we believe enables us to take a systematic approach to rapidly develop improved cell therapies. We believe having established manufacturing capabilities and operations within the U.S. early in the development of our product candidates is a competitive advantage. Over time, we expect to expand regional manufacturing capacity and potentially add external supply nodes to meet projected product requirements for commercialization. We believe that anticipated future clinical and commercial demand for Lomecel-B and new pipeline programs can be met, as our process has been designed for meet these demands as milestones are achieved. We believe our scalable robust manufacturing process, along with our proprietary technologies and our industry experienced team, would be challenging and costly for potential competitors to replicate.
Contract Development and Manufacturing Services
 
We produce all of our product candidates at our cell manufacturing facility to satisfy our ongoing clinical studies, The Bahamas Registry Trial, and research and development needs. As a revenue-generating opportunity, we utilize excess capacity, when available, to provide contract manufacturing and research and development services to third parties. We are currently serving two clients and have initiated limited business development activity to increase our client base as a means for increasing revenue. In total we have generated $346,000 in contract fees. In 2020, because of COVID-19-related impact on travel, business development and marketing of our contract manufacturing services was reduced, which negatively affected revenue from this business.
Commercialization
 
We currently have no established sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure. In order to commercialize any of our product candidates if approved for commercial sale, we will need a sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities or collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing experience.
 
As we move our product candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several options for each product candidate’s commercialization strategy. These options include further building an internal sales force, entering into a joint marketing collaboration with another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, or out-licensing any future approved product to another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company.
 
Competition
 
The field of regenerative medicine, which includes gene therapies, cell therapies (such as Lomecel-B), and tissue-engineered products, is broadly defined as “products intended to repair, replace or regenerate organs, tissues, cells, genes, and metabolic processes in the body,” per the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, an international advocacy organization. Regenerative medicine companies number over 1,000 worldwide as of the first half of 2020.

In some of our indications, we face competition from both cellular therapy companies, and pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies. The following table is a general list of cellular therapy companies that we believe could be considered our primary competition on the basis that these companies are developers of living cell-based therapies, albeit for different indications in most cases.

Biology of Aging Research Companies
 
To our knowledge, there are no other companies currently conducting clinical trials for Aging Frailty using a regenerative medicine approach. However, this is likely to change as the emphasis on developing an effective treatment grows. As the leader in this field, we believe we are well-positioned to advance our Aging Frailty program into pivotal Phase 3 trials.
 
Shanghai East Hospital in Shanghai, China is planning to initiate a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study of umbilical cord MSC infusion for Aging Frailty.
 
Healeon Medical Inc. is conducting an invitation-only trial to determine the safety and efficacy of delivery of autologous cellular stromal vascular fraction (cSVF) to improve the quality of life and functional health in frailty.
 
The University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio is collaborating with the NIH to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of metformin, the Type-2 diabetes medication, for the prevention of frailty in subjects aged 65 to 95. Other academic groups or hospitals have or are testing hormonal treatments such as ghrelin or testosterone to prevent or treat frailty. The vast majority of interventional trials typically involve lifestyle intervention, specifically evaluating diet, dietary supplements, or exercise modifications, or a combination thereof. A number of companies are researching different approaches and therapeutics in the broad “anti-aging” category, developing therapies that may extend “healthspan” by slowing or reversing diseases associated with aging, or the aging process itself.
 

● | Calico Life Sciences, LLC: This Google-backed company is researching compounds that are intended to treat aging-related diseases and conditions; however, its first clinical study involves patients with advanced solid tumor cancers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Unity Biotechnology: Unity’s focus is to “extend human health span, the period in one’s life unburdened by the disease of aging.” UBX is targeting senescence (the process whereby cells cease to divide, and linger in the body releasing harmful proteins) and is in the category called “senolytic medicines”. 
● | AgeX Therapeutics: AgeX is a pre-clinical stage company testing telomerase-expressing Pluripotent Stem Cells (PSCs) in an attempt to reverse cell aging, and extend human health and life spans. 

Competition in Alzheimer’s Disease
 
There are several companies currently testing cellular therapy in neurologic and cognitive disorders. However, in the United States, we believe we are the furthest advanced in the clinical development of a regenerative medicine approach to treating AD. The following companies have publicly indicated that they are conducting, or intend to conduct, cell therapy clinical trials in AD.

● | Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics: In 2020, Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics, a U.S. company, announced its intention to initiate a multinational Phase 2 trial to test its autologous MSC neurotrophic factor investigational product in AD. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Medipost Co. Ltd.: Medipost, a South Korean company, has reported that it has completed a Phase 2a study in AD using its umbilical cord-derived allogeneic MSCs. 
● | CHABiotech Ltd.: This South Korea-based company is conducting a Phase 1/2 trial of enhanced placenta-derived stem cells in AD, according to its website.

There are many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are conducting clinical trials of various therapeutics for the treatment of AD. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, in 2020 there are 121 unique therapies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Some of the more established and well-known companies in this group include Biogen, Novartis, Eisai, and Eli Lilly.
 
Competition in HLHS
 
Currently there are no FDA-approved treatments for HLHS. In addition to our HLHS clinical program, Boston Children’s Hospital is sponsoring a study of allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (rexlemestrocel-L) in HLHS with cells provided by Mesoblast Ltd. We are not aware of any other industry-sponsored clinical trials testing allogeneic stem cell therapy for HLHS in the U.S. or elsewhere.
 
Competition in ARDS
 
Currently there are no FDA-approved treatments for ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a spike in research on the potential for allogeneic MSCs to treat acute lung injury resulting from infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Several cellular therapy companies had ongoing ARDS programs prior to the pandemic, and several other companies, including us, initiated clinical studies during the pandemic.
 

● | Athersys: Athersys is a U.S.-based cell therapy company developing an allogeneic bone-marrow derived stem cell product. Athersys is currently conducting a Phase 2/3 trial in ARDS, and has received both Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) and Fast Track Designations from the FDA. Athersys had previously conducted Phase 1/2 trials in ARDS prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mesoblast: Mesoblast, an Australia-based company, is conducting a multi-country Phase 2/3 clinical study for ARDS related to COVID-19 using its allogeneic bone-marrow MSC product remestemcel-L. 
● | Pluristem: Israeli company Pluristem has initiated Phase 2 trials in the U.S. and Germany for testing its placenta-tissue stem cell product. 

Intellectual Property
 
Generation and protection of intellectual property, including trade secrets, proprietary technology, manufacturing techniques, and patents, is of critical importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally, acquired from third parties, or licensed from third parties. We also intend to seek and rely on any statutory or regulatory protections, including FDA’s expedited review program, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
 
We have a combination of Company-owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications related to cell-based therapy and its various uses. This portfolio includes patent applications that are directed to use of allogeneic MSCs to (a) increase humoral immunity; (b) treat sexual dysfunction; and (c) act as adjuvants for vaccines. We also have in-licensed a patent family directed to methods of use of CD271+ MSC precursor cells derived from bone marrow for cardiac repair. Our patent applications contain claims that, if allowed, specifically protect the use of our product in individuals with Aging Frailty, immunosenescence, and other age-related diseases. Such applications may not result in issued patents and, even if patents do issue, the issued patents may not be in a form that will provide us with meaningful ability to maintain exclusivity for our products. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. Trade secrets are difficult to protect and enforce and therefore provide us with only limited protection.
 
We expect to file additional patent applications in support of current and new product candidates, as well as for process and manufacturing-related improvements or inventions, should these arise. These expected additional patent applications may be related to existing patent applications or may create new patent families. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop, manufacture, administer, and use them. Our commercial success will also depend on successfully defending our patents against third-party challenges and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We are aware of several U.S. patents held by third parties covering potentially similar or related products, and their manufacture and use. Generally, conducting clinical trials and other acts relating to FDA approval are not considered acts of infringement in the United States. If and when Lomecel-B MSCs are approved by the FDA, third parties may seek to enforce their patents by filing a patent infringement lawsuit against us. Our ability to deter and, if necessary, to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products or products that are similar to our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We can neither be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. We cannot be sure that no unpublished third-party patent applications exist that would have an effect on our freedom to operate. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most jurisdictions where we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in examining and granting a patent. Patent term in the United States may be shortened if a patent is subject to a terminal disclaimer over another patent. Delays on the part of a patentee may decrease patent term adjustment.
 
In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved “active ingredient” or methods of its use may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, or the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the statutory term of a patent, including any patent term adjustment to which the patent is entitled. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the active ingredient or method is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions for any issued patents we may obtain in any jurisdiction where such patent term extensions are available. We are not assured that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of those extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 
In some instances, we file patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
 
We may file U.S. non-provisional applications, direct foreign applications under the Paris Convention and the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications. Those applications claim the benefit of the priority date of one or more earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the PCT member states in which national or regional patent applications can later be pursued based on the PCT application.
 
For all patent applications, we determine claim strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are considered. We seek to file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We routinely reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to pursue maximum coverage and value for our processes and compositions. Further, we may modify claims during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.
 
We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors. These include the volume and scope of the prior art, the novelty, non-obviousness, and utility of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the written description and enablement requirements of the patent laws. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly narrowed before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from copying by competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. We cannot predict whether, in certain jurisdictions, a third-party will use a method confidentially that we later independently discover and patent, which may result in a limited grant to the third party of the ability to continue to practice that method.
 
In addition to patent protection, we rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contracts with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets indefinitely.
 
20

 

We require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Third-party patents could require us to alter our development or commercial strategies or our products or processes, to obtain licenses or to cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. If third parties file requests for inter partes review of our patents, then we may have to defend those patents in the USPTO. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 
When available to expand market exclusivity, our strategy is to obtain, or license additional intellectual property related to current or contemplated development platforms, core elements of technology and/or clinical candidates.
 
Company-Owned Intellectual Property
 
Mesenchymal Stem Cells as Vaccine Adjuvants and Methods for Using the Same. The claims within this patent application family are currently directed to methods of enhancing the immune response to vaccination, which is one of the research objectives of our Phase 1/2 HERA Trial. This research is relevant to Aging Frailty subjects, who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of viral contagion, such as influenza or COVID-19, and who may be lacking in immunoprotection. Certain claims address the ability to enhance a subject’s immune response to a vaccine through the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in a subject that exhibits “Inflammaging.” In this family we own one pending U.S. patent application and 11 patent applications outside of the United States (in ten jurisdictions). All of the patent applications are national or regional phase applications based on a PCT application filed in February 2017 and claiming priority to a U.S. provisional application filed in February 2016. National or regional phase applications were filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Patent Organization, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. If issued and assuming all maintenance and annuity fees are paid, patents arising from these applications are projected to expire in 2037.
 
Methods of Using Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Effect Cellular and Humoral Immunity. Certain claims in this family of patent applications relate to the ability for mesenchymal stem cell therapy to improve the immune system function in patients with chronic systemic inflammation, a hallmark of frailty. It is believed that raising or lowering specific biomarkers after therapeutic intervention by a minimum amount may provide broad protection from an intellectual property standpoint and reflects clinical goals of treatment and treatment response.
 
In this family we own one pending U.S. patent application and 13 patent applications outside of the United States (in 13 jurisdictions). With two exceptions (The Bahamas and Taiwan), all of the applications are national or regional phase applications based on a PCT application filed in November 2017 and claiming priority to a U.S. provisional application filed in November 2016. The applications in The Bahamas and Taiwan claim priority to that same provisional application but were not filed using the PCT. In addition to the applications in Taiwan and The Bahamas, PCT national or regional phase applications were filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Organization, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and Hong Kong. If issued and assuming all maintenance and annuity fees are paid, patents arising from these applications are projected to expire in 2037.
 
Treatment of Sexual Dysfunction and Improvement in Sexual Quality of Life. This application family is directed towards increasing libido and improving sexual function and satisfaction in a female patient through the use of allogeneic or autologous MSC therapy, whether derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this family we own one pending U.S. patent application and 13 patent applications outside of the United States. With two exceptions (The Bahamas and Taiwan), all of the applications are national or regional phase applications based on a PCT application filed in June 15, 2018 and claiming priority to a U.S. provisional application filed in June 2017. The applications in The Bahamas and Taiwan claim priority to that same provisional application but were not filed using the PCT. In addition to the applications in Taiwan and The Bahamas, PCT national or regional phase applications were filed in Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Organization, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and the United States. If issued and assuming all maintenance and annuity fees are paid, patents arising from these applications are projected to expire in June 2038.

Potency Assay. We own one U.S. provisional patent application relating to examination of protein production by human mesenchymal stem cells in response to stimuli. That application was filed in April 2020. Related applications, if any, are not required to be filed until April 2021.
 
Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease with Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells. We own one U.S. provisional patent application related to treatment of AD with allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells. That application was filed in September 2020. Related applications, if any, are not required to be filed until September 2021. 
 
License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations
 
The University of Miami (UM)
 
On November 20, 2014, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with UM (the “UM License”) for the use of certain Aging Frailty-related MSC technology rights developed by our Chief Science Officer at UM. The UM License is a worldwide, exclusive license, with right to sublicense, with respect to any and all know-how specifically related to the development of the culture-expanded MSCs for aging-related frailty used at the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute of UM (“IMSCs”), all SOPs used to create the IMSCs, and all data supporting isolation, culture, expansion, processing, cryopreservation and management of the IMSCs. We are required to pay UM (i) a license issue fee of $5,000, (ii) a running royalty in an amount equal to three percent of annual net sales on products or services developed from the technology, which amounts are payable on a country-by-country basis beginning on the date of first commercial sale and ending on the expiration or termination of the UM License Agreement, and which may be reduced to the extent we are required to pay royalties to a third party for the same product or process, (iii) escalating annual cash payments on the anniversary date of the agreement of ten, fifteen, twenty-five, forty and fifty thousand dollars, which amounts may be offset by other consideration paid. UM also received a one percent (1%) equity grant, which is subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.
 
The agreement extends for up to 20 years from the last date a product or process is commercialized from the technology. This agreement was amended on December 11, 2017. The 2017 amendment modified the dates of the milestone completions under the original UM License. To date, the Company has made payments totaling $140,000 to UM, and as of December 31, 2020, we had accrued $50,000 in milestone fees payable to UM and $100,000 for patent related reimbursements based on the estimated progress to date.
 
The agreement was further amended on March 3, 2021 to increase the license fee due to UM. The Company agreed to pay UM an additional fee of $100,000, to defray patent costs, with $70,000 due within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the amendment, and the remainder to be paid in equal installments of $7,500 on the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th year anniversaries of the effective date. The Company also agreed to issue an additional 110,387 unregistered shares of Class A common stock shares to UM. The Company and UM agreed to the following modification of the milestone payments: (a) No payment will be due upon the completion of Phase 2 clinical trials for the product; (b) a one-time payment of $500,000, payable within six months of the completion of the first Phase 3 clinical trial of the products (based upon the final data unblinding); (c) a one-time payment of $500,000 payable within six months of the receipt by the Company of approval for the first new drug application (“NDA”), biologics application (“BLA”), or other marketing or licensing application for the product; and (d) a one-time payment of $500,000 payable within six months of the first sale following product approval. “Approval” refers to Product approval, licensure, or other marketing authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or any successor agency. The amendment also provided for the Company’s license of additional technology, to the extent not previously included in the UM License, and granted the Company an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license for (a) the HLHS IND with ckit+ cells; and (b) UMP-438 titled “Method of Determining Responsiveness to Cell Therapy in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.”.
 
We have the right to terminate the UM License upon 60 days’ prior written notice, and either party has the right to terminate upon a breach of the UM License. Currently we are in discussions to potentially modify certain terms.
 
JMH MD Holdings
 
On December 22, 2016, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with JMH MD Holdings (“JMHMD”), an affiliate of our Chief Science Officer, for the use of CD271+ technology, a subpopulation of bone marrow-derived MSCs. We are required to pay JMHMD a running royalty in an amount equal to one percent of the annual net sales of the licensed product(s) used, leased, or sold by or for us by any sub-licensees, which amounts are payable on a country-by-country basis beginning on the date of first commercial sale and ending on the latter of expiration of the last to expire patent rights in such country or ten years from the first commercial sale in such country (provided that if all claims within the patent rights have expired or been finally deemed invalid then the royalty will be reduced by 50%), and which may also be reduced to the extent we are required to pay royalties to a third party for the same product or process. We are also required to pay an initial fee and, by the first day of each anniversary of the Agreement, starting with the second anniversary, a minimum royalty of ten thousand dollars. JMHMD also received an equity grant equal to one-half of one percent of the then outstanding units of the Company on a fully-diluted basis. If we sublicense the technology, we are also required to pay an amount equal to 10% of the net sales of the sub-licensees.
 
22

 

Under the agreement, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the following milestones: (i) submit an investigational new drug application to FDA (or international equivalent) within one year of effective date of agreement, (ii) initiate a clinical trial utilizing bone marrow derived CD271+ Precursor Cells within three years of the effective date; provided, that any of the milestones may be extended for up to six months for a total of three times by notice and payment of a five thousand dollar extension fee. Failure to achieve these milestones within five years of the effective date triggers a right of termination by JMHMD. Otherwise, the agreement is to remain in effect until either the date all issued patents and filed patent applications have expired or been abandoned, or 20 years after the date of FDA approval of the last commercialized product or process arising from the patent rights whichever comes later. Further, each party has the right to terminate upon sixty days’ prior written notice, or in the event of breach. If the Company sublicenses the technology, it is also required to pay an amount equal to 10% of the net sales of the sub-licensees. In addition, on December 23, 2016, as required by the license agreement the Company paid an initial fee of $250,000 to JMHMD, and issued to it 10,000 Series C Units, valued at $250,000. The $500,000 of value provided to JMHMD for the license agreement, along with professional fees of approximately $27,000, were recorded as an intangible asset that is amortized over the life of the license agreement which was defined as 20 years. The Company to date has not incurred any royalty or sublicense related expense, and there were no license fees due during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 pertaining to this agreement. We paid legal fees of approximately $24,000 and $25,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with the patent prosecution, issuance, and maintenance fees related to CD271+ technology.
 
In-licensed Patents and Applications
 
Bone Marrow Derived CD271+ Precursor Cells for Cardiac Repair. We have in-licensed the exclusive right to use CD271+ MSC precursors from bone marrow to treat certain aging-related conditions and diseases, such as frailty, Metabolic Syndrome, loss of muscle due to aging or frailty and neurocognitive disorders. That patent has issued in Australia, China, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, and Singapore. The patent application remains pending in U.S. (where there are two pending utility applications), Canada, and Brazil. The Canadian and Brazilian applications have both been allowed. One of the U.S. applications is currently under appeal with the USPTO. While method of use claims may relate to the use of CD271+ cells for cardiac repair, our license terms exclude our use of CD271+ cells for preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases or disorders, including congenital cardiovascular defects. Assuming that all maintenance and annuity fees are paid, patents in this family are expected to expire in August 2031.
Trademarks
 
We have registered trademarks or applied for registered trademarks for “Longeveron” and “LMSC” in the following jurisdictions. Over the next one to two years, we plan to phase out the registrations and applications for “LMSC” in favor of registrations for “LOMECEL-B”. In some jurisdictions multiple registrations and/or applications exist so that multiple goods and/or services may be listed:

Government Regulation and Biologic Drug Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. We believe that the FDA will regulate Lomecel-B as a biologic drug (i.e., a biologic) through the biologics license application (BLA) process under the jurisdiction of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). We will work with FDA to confirm that a BLA is the most appropriate pathway and that CBER will be the FDA center responsible for review and licensure (i.e., approval). However, FDA may disagree with us, in which case we will follow FDA’s recommendation. For future product candidates we will also confirm the appropriate approval pathway (i.e., BLA or new drug application (NDA)) and the appropriate FDA center with regulatory oversight (i.e., CBER or the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)).

U.S. Biologic Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, biologic drugs—or simply “biologics”—are regulated under two statutes: The Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and their implementing regulations. However, submission and approval of only one application—typically either a BLA or an NDA—is required prior to marketing. The FDA has also issued numerous “Guidance Documents” and other materials that address specific aspects of biologic development for specific types of product candidates (e.g., cells, tissues, gene therapies, or vaccines). The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the biologic development, approval, or post-approval processes may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following steps:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s current good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an independent IRB at each clinical site (or by one “commercial IRB”) before each trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practice (cGCP) requirements to establish the safety, purity, and potency (i.e., efficacy) of the proposed biologic for its intended use; 
● | submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all clinical trials; 
● | satisfactory outcome of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with GMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with cGCPs; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 

 
The specific preclinical studies and clinical testing that is required for a BLA varies widely depending upon the specific type of product candidate under development. Prior to beginning a human clinical trial with either a biologic or drug product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA and that IND must become effective. The focus of an IND submission is the general investigational plan and protocol for the proposed clinical study. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical hold is lifted and the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters for monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Other submissions to an IND include protocol amendments, information amendments, IND safety reports and annual reports. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each clinical trial site (or a “commercial IRB” that acts as the IRB at one or more of the clinical trial sites) must review and approve the protocol and informed consent form before the clinical trial may begin. The IRB also monitors the clinical trial until completed.

Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some clinical trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring committee (DMC). A DMC authorizes whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The DMC may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Related reporting requirements for the sponsor, clinical investigator, and/or IRB also include IND safety reports and updating clinical trial results in public registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov).
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects. These clinical trials are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, side effects, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer it to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in individuals who have the targeted disease or condition instead of healthy subjects. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited population of individuals who have the specified disease or condition to continue to evaluate safety, as well as preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 (i.e., pivotal) clinical trials. 
● | Phase 3: Generally, the largest in size, Phase 3 clinical trials are generally conducted at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. The product candidate is administered to an expanded population of individuals who have the specified disease or condition to further evaluate dosage, provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and gain additional safety data. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 

 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal studies. Sponsors must also develop information about the chemical and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biologic. In addition, the sponsor must develop and test appropriate packaging, and must conduct stability studies to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
During the development of a new biologic, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA. These meetings typically occur prior to submission of an IND (i.e., pre-IND meeting), at the end of Phase 2 (i.e., EOP2 meeting), and before a BLA is submitted (i.e., pre-BLA meeting). Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use EOP2 meetings to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new biologic.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Process for Biologic Drugs
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the sponsor submits a BLA to the FDA. A BLA contains the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical testing, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial application fee under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments (PDUFA). PDUFA fees apply to both drugs and biologics. Sponsors may seek a waiver of these fees in certain limited circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first BLA or NDA submitted by a small business. Product candidates with an orphan drug designation (ODD) are not subject to the BLA application fee unless the product application also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a biologic is safe, pure, and potent (i.e., effective) for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is GMP-compliant to assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under PDUFA, the FDA has a goal date of ten months from the date of “filing” to review and act on the submission. However, the time between submission and filing can add an additional two months as FDA conducts a preliminary review to ensure that the BLA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Formal FDA review of the BLA does not begin until FDA has accepted it for filing. The FDA may refer an application in some cases to an advisory committee for its independent review. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation to FDA as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
25

 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the locations where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMPs, and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. An important part of a BLA is a lot release protocol that the sponsor will use to test each lot of product made after BLA approval, as well as the FDA’s own test plan that will be used for confirmatory testing of each post-approval product lot that is made before it is released to the public. If the FDA determines that the data and information in the application, including about the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities, are not acceptable, then the FDA will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will either issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with approved prescribing information for specific approved indications. On the other hand, a CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but the BLA cannot be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies identified by the FDA and describes the actions the sponsor must take to correct those deficiencies. A sponsor that receives a CRL must resubmit the BLA after addressing the deficiencies or withdraw the application. Even if such additional data and information are submitted to address the deficiencies, the FDA may decide that the data and information in the resubmitted BLA do not satisfy the approval criteria.
 
Following marketing approval, a sponsor may need to fulfill certain post-marketing requirements (PMRs) or post-marketing commitments (PMCs). For example, post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients for the intended therapeutic indication. The trials may be agreed upon prior to approval, or the FDA may require them if new safety issues emerge. Following approval, a sponsor may also need to conduct a pediatric study that was temporarily deferred during the initial product development process. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a sponsor must conduct pediatric clinical trials for most new drugs or biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. PREA studies must be included in the application unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver.
 
A risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) may also be an important component of a BLA approval that requires sponsor post-marketing regulatory efforts. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a drug or biologic and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use. A REMS may include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use (ETASU) such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools.
 
Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with PMRs, PMCs, or a REMS program is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also request that a product be recalled for an identified safety issue. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 
FDA Expedited Review Programs for Serious Conditions
 
Under various statutory and regulatory authorities, the FDA has authority to review and approve certain drugs and biologic drugs on an expedited basis if they are intended to treat a serious condition and meet other requirements. These expedited programs are discussed below.
 
RMAT Designation. In 2017, the FDA established a new designation, known as the regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation, as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. If they meet the appropriate criteria, regenerative medicine therapies to treat, modify, reverse, or cure serious conditions may be eligible for RMAT designation as well as FDA’s other expedited programs (i.e., fast track, breakthrough therapy, or priority review designations or accelerated approval). As with other biological products, regenerative medicine therapies receiving RMAT designation must meet the same standards for approval, including demonstrating the product’s safety and effectiveness. As described in Section 3033 of the 21st Century Cures Act, an investigational product is eligible for RMAT designation if:
 

● | It is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products (except for those regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 C.F.R. Part 1271); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | It is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and 
● | Preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. 

 
26

 

Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough designations, including early interactions with the FDA to discuss the use of any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support an accelerated approval. However, unlike a breakthrough designation, the RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over available therapies. A request for an RMAT designation can be included in a new IND, or submitted as an amendment to an existing IND. As with other expedited programs, the FDA can withdraw an RMAT designation that has been granted if the designation criteria are no longer met.
 
Accelerated Approval. In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 
Fast-Track Designation. The fast-track designation is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug and biologic drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, products are eligible for this designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. With regard to a fast-track product, the FDA may review sections of the marketing applications on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the application sections, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section.
 
Priority Review Designation. A product is eligible for priority review designation if it has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a priority review-designated product in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to the standard ten months for review.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of products referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of a fast-track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review designation, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of that product.
 
A drug or biologic drug that is subject to one or more of these expedited programs may be reviewed and approved more quickly than other non-expedited program products; however, the standard for approval (i.e., safety and effectiveness) does not change. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that it no longer meets the conditions of the expedited program and the expedited program status may be removed. We may explore one or more of these opportunities for Longeveron product candidates as appropriate.
 
Marketing Exclusivity
 
In the case of biologic drugs, several types of marketing exclusivity may apply:
 

● | Reference product exclusivity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
● | Orphan drug designation and orphan drug exclusivity; and 
● | Pediatric exclusivity. 

 
27

 

Reference Product Exclusivity
 
We believe that FDA will regulate Lomecel-B as a new biologic and will require submission and approval of a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). The PHS Act includes a framework for determining when a biologic is a “reference product” and therefore eligible for marketing exclusivity. The reference product is the single biologic against which a biosimilar (a product that is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product) or an interchangeable biosimilar (a product that is both biosimilar to, and will produce the same clinical result as, the reference product) is evaluated.
 
FDA must determine the date of “first licensure” (i.e., approval) of a biologic which will, in turn, determine whether that biologic qualifies as a reference product that will be eligible for statutory exclusivity (and when such exclusivity will expire). Typically (but not always) the date of approval is the date of first licensure. Once that date of first licensure is determined for a reference product, then FDA will not approve a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar until the date that is 12 years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. However, FDA may receive an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. These 12- and four-year terms are each extended by six months if the product has been awarded six-month pediatric exclusivity.
 
Legal uncertainties remain about FDA’s application of the date of first licensure and statutory exclusivity provisions to cell therapy products. At the appropriate time, we intend to provide information to FDA so that FDA can determine the date of first licensure of Lomecel-B (or any other product candidate that will be regulated as a biologic) which will, in turn, set the date from which statutory exclusivity will begin to run. However, FDA may not make an immediate decision about the date of first licensure at the time it approves a new biologic. Furthermore, there is currently no precedent showing how FDA will apply this statutory framework to a cell therapy product. The law in this area is evolving and will likely continue to evolve.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
To encourage the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to develop drugs and biologics to treat diseases or conditions that affect relatively few patients in the U.S., Congress enacted the Orphan Drug Act in 1983. As amended, under this act the FDA may grant an orphan drug designation (ODD) for a drug or biologic drug being developed to treat a “rare disease or condition,” defined as affecting less than 200,000 persons in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 persons in the U.S. but for which there is no reasonable expectation that development costs will be recovered from U.S. sales of the product. A request for ODD must be submitted to the FDA before a marketing application is submitted (i.e., BLA or NDA), but there is no assurance that FDA will award an ODD if requested. If awarded, information about the ODD will be made public on FDA’s website.
 
An ODD does not change the regulatory review standards of safety and effectiveness and does not shorten the length of the FDA review or approval process. However, there are a number of potential benefits if a drug or biologic with an ODD is eventually approved. If an investigational product with an ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, then the approved product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity (ODE). Having ODE means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same use or indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances (including but not limited to demonstrating clinical superiority of a new product vs. the product with ODE because of greater safety, greater effectiveness, or making a major contribution to patient care; or an FDA finding that the sponsor of the product with ODE cannot assure that sufficient quantities of the product will be available for patients). Even if an investigational product has an ODD, there is no guarantee that FDA will award ODE upon approval.
 
Competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same use or indication, or the same product for a different use or indication. Approved drugs and biologics can also be used by physicians off-label, which is within the scope of their practice of medicine. Accordingly, receiving ODE is not an absolute protection against potentially competing products. Moreover, an ODE awarded to another sponsor could block FDA approval of one of Longeveron’s product candidates for seven years. The law involving ODDs and ODEs, including FDA’s interpretation of “same drug,” is continuing to evolve through litigation, as well as changes to FDA regulations and policies.
 
In addition to the potential award of seven-year ODE upon product approval, the benefits of an ODD also include eligibility for certain research tax credits and a waiver of the marketing application fee. An application for a prescription product with an ODD is not subject to an application fee unless the application also includes an indication for a non-rare disease or condition as well. For fiscal year 2021, the application fee for a new drug or biologic requiring clinical studies is $2,875,842.
 
Pediatric Exclusivity
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity (e.g., ODE) if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.
 
28

 

Post-approval Requirements
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug and biologic drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs, which therefore imposes certain procedural and documentation requirements on us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | clinical holds on clinical studies; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
● | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of approved products. A company can make only those claims that were approved by the FDA in the application for marketing approval and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of approved treatments, as the practice of medicine is outside the scope of FDA’s authority. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.
 
29

 

Other Healthcare Laws
 
Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information; state and local laws which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities or that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Japanese Laws and Regulations
 
Under the 2014 law passed by the Japanese government, two new Acts were added that regulate regenerative medicine development and offer two pathways to market for regenerative medicine therapeutic candidates: The Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine (ASRM) and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Act (PMD Act).
 
Japan’s Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine. The ASRM route is intended to allow physicians to provide cellular therapies to patients through an application process that is regulated by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). Manufacturers of cell and gene therapy products wishing to utilize this pathway must identify and work with a partner clinic or hospital which enables the clinic to act as the distributor, with the manufacturer receiving a fee or a royalty, for example. The ASRM route may require a clinical trial or other clinical data in order to seek approval from the MHLW. Treatments under the ASRM route must be provided by a medical institution for the purpose of either “medical research” or as a “medical treatment at one’s own expense.” Therapies provided under this framework are not covered by Japan’s National Health Insurance.
 
Japan’s Pharmaceutical & Medical Device Act. The PMD Act includes special treatment for regenerative medicine products and identifies them as a stand-alone medical category with a novel “conditional approval” system. Sponsors seeking manufacturing approval need to provide clinical data to show that the product does not have any major safety concerns, clinical data to demonstrate “probable” efficacy, and satisfy established chemistry, manufacturing and controls criteria. A conditional approval can therefore occur after a Phase 2 trial. The conditional approval period lasts for a maximum of seven years. Sponsors that receive conditional approval must re-apply, with additional satisfactory safety and efficacy data, for a full unconditional approval within the timeframe provided to them under the conditional approval. A conditional approval allows the product to be marketed and partially reimbursed through Japan’s National Health Insurance.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which the product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and their level of reimbursement for the product. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be time-consuming, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
 
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
 
30

 

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA were invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2029 absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the other of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Additionally, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for the fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.

Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Beilina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new product candidates that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.

Risk Factors Summary
 
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. Please refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K below for additional discussion of the risks summarized in this Risk Factors Summary.
 
Risks Relating to our Business
 

● | We have a limited operating history and have no products approved for commercial sale, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and predict our future success and viability. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The lack of any existing FDA-approved allogeneic, cell-based therapies for Aging Frailty, Alzheimer’s disease, the Metabolic Syndrome and Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome could complicate and delay FDA approval of our product candidates for these indications. 
● | Our product development programs are based on novel technologies and are inherently risky. If the potential of our cell-based product candidates to treat diseases is not realized, or the FDA, other regulatory bodies or marketplace fail to understand or accept our technology, the value of our technology and our development programs could be significantly reduced. In addition, ethical and other concerns surrounding the use of human-derived cell products may negatively affect public perception of us or our products or product candidates. 
● | If we are not able to recruit and retain qualified management and scientific personnel, we may fail in developing our technologies and product candidates. 
● | Our use of bone marrow and biologic growth media poses unique challenges to our operations.

 | ● | We have a history of losses, and will require additional capital to fund our operations. Failure to obtain necessary financing will likely impact our ability to complete the development and commercialization of Lomecel-B or other product candidates. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | ● | According to the FDA, neither “Aging Frailty” or simply “Frailty,” nor the Metabolic Syndrome presently have definitions that are acceptable for characterizing the conditions for regulatory purposes, primarily due to either a lack of consensus on the definitions, an insufficient understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that cause any or all of the manifestations, or both. The FDA and the Japanese PMDA have both indicated that the concept of “Frailty” or the Metabolic Syndrome as an indication will require additional clinical data and discussion before future pivotal trials and marketing authorization. 
 | ● | Public health threats including those related to COVID-19, could adversely impact our operations. 
Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
 | ● | If we are unable to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights for our technology and our product candidates, or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate, our competitive position could be harmed, and our ability to continue clinical trials and commercially market products could be adversely affected. 
 | ● | Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties; if one or more third parties were to assert that we infringe their patents or are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization, it could impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and otherwise significantly harm our business. 
 | ● | We are a party to certain licensing agreements that give us rights to specified technology that is material to our business; termination of, or issues relating to, such licenses could have material adverse impact on our ability to commercialize our technology. 
Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Governmental Regulations 
 | ● | Lomecel-B, and any of our future investigational products, must comply with FDA or other regulatory authority requirements to demonstrate that they are safe and effective for one or more specific indications before they are approved. We cannot guarantee that the FDA or another regulatory authority will accept or interpret our pre-clinical or clinical data in the same way that we do, or that it will approve our marketing application. Even if the FDA or another regulatory authority grants marketing approval, there will be additional, ongoing regulatory obligations that we must meet. 
 | ● | Achieving marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully complete our clinical trials, which themselves are dependent on a number of factors. These factors may delay, add additional costs to our process, and otherwise complicate or block our pathway to commercialization. 


Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 
----------------------------------------------------
 | ● | Our reliance on third parties to provide us with supplies to produce our product candidates, to assist in future approved product manufacturing and/or distribution, and to provide reimbursement for our products, may result in increased costs, shortages, delays or interruptions in the supply of our product candidates for our clinical trials and approved products eventually to our customers. Further, arrangements entered into with third-party collaborators to help us develop and commercialize our product candidates expose us to various risks if they fail to perform in accordance with our expectations or at all.

Risks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | ● | Interim, “topline” and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish may change as more data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 
 | ● | Our foreign operations pose additional risks, including obtaining approval from foreign regulatory authorities, or with respect to FDA accepting data from trials conducted in foreign jurisdictions. 
 | ● | We may face difficulties relating to compliance with various laws, including those relating to health and safety, and from changes to current and future legislation, both in the U.S. as well as in other foreign jurisdictions where we may be operating. 
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock 
 | ● | The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock. 
 | ● | Two holders, including our co-founder and members of our Board, hold a significant portion of our Class B common stock, and will control the direction of our business and such parties’ ownership of our common stock will prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant decisions. 
 | ● | We will face risks relating to our new status as a publicly-traded company. 
Risks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Our Growth and Other Risks Related to Our Business 
 | ● | We will need to grow our organization in order to successfully implement our plans and strategies; this growth involves risk with respect to additional resources, data privacy and protection needs, and marketing concerns.
