ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Physicians Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, and Physicians Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, were organized in April 2013 to acquire, selectively develop, own, and manage health care properties that are leased to physicians, hospitals, and health care delivery systems. References to the “Operating Partnership” mean collectively the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in July 2013. The Trust’s common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and the Trust is included in the MSCI US REIT Index and the S&P MidCap 400.
We have grown our consolidated portfolio of gross real estate investments from approximately $124 million at the time of our IPO to approximately $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 277 health care properties (which excludes our Corporate headquarters) located in 32 states with approximately 15,528,879 net leasable square feet, of which approximately 95% was leased with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 5.5 years. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of the net leasable square footage of our portfolio was either on the campus of a hospital or strategically affiliated with a health system.
We receive a cash rental stream from health care providers under our leases. Approximately 93% of the annualized base rent payments from our properties as of December 31, 2022 are from absolute net or triple-net leases pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for operating expenses subject to specific lease terms relating to the property, including, but not limited to, real estate taxes, utilities, property insurance, routine maintenance and repairs, and property management. These lease structures insulate us from increases in most operating expenses, especially increases in operating expenses that are beyond our control, and provide relatively predictable cash flow. Approximately 6% of the annualized base rent payments from our properties as of December 31, 2022 are from modified gross leases that allow us to recover operating expenses that exceed certain base year operating expense thresholds in such leases, thus protecting us from increases in operating expenses. 
We seek to structure our leases to generate attractive returns on a long-term basis. Our leases typically have initial terms of 5 to 15 years and include annual rent escalators of approximately 1.5% to 4.0%, with an annual weighted average rent escalator of approximately 2.4%. Certain of the Company’s leases include provisions indexing annual rent escalators to changes in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), often with a floor or ceiling. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 5.7% of the Company’s annual rent escalators have CPI provisions. Our operating results depend significantly on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that our portfolio of medical office buildings and other health care facilities will enable us to generate stable cash flows over time because of the diversity of our tenants, the creditworthiness of our tenants, a staggered lease expiration schedule, long-term leases, and low historical occurrence of tenants defaulting under their leases. 
As of December 31, 2022, leases representing a percentage of our consolidated portfolio on the basis of leased square feet will expire as follows: 

Year | Portfolio Lease Expirations
MTM (1) | 1.3% 
2023 | 4.7% 
2024 | 5.5% 
2025 | 7.0% 
2026 | 22.8% 
2027 | 11.7% 
2028 | 12.0% 
2029 | 6.2% 
2030 | 5.7% 
2031 | 6.7% 
2032 | 8.3% 
Thereafter | 8.1% 
Total | 100.0% 

(1)“MTM” means month-to-month. This line also includes 12 leases which expired on December 31, 2022, representing 0.9% of leased square feet.
We invest in real estate that is integral to providing high-quality health care services. Our properties are typically located on a campus with a hospital or other health care facilities or strategically affiliated with a hospital or other health care system. We believe the impact of government programs and continuing trends in the health care industry create attractive opportunities for us to invest in health care-related real estate. Our management team has significant health care real estate experience and has long-established relationships with physicians, hospitals, and health care delivery system decision makers who we believe will provide quality investment and growth opportunities. Our principal investments include medical office buildings (“MOBs”), ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), outpatient treatment facilities, and other real estate integral to health care providers. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders through a combination of stable and increasing cash flow and potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and our common shares.
The Trust is a Maryland real estate investment trust and elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We conduct our business through an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our properties and our ownership interest in joint ventures are owned by our Operating Partnership directly or through limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or other subsidiaries. The Trust is the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and, as of February 14, 2023, owned approximately 96% of the Operating Partnership Units (“OP Units”).
Our Objectives and Growth Strategy
Overview
Our principal business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders through a combination of (i) sustainable and increasing rental revenue and cash flow that generate reliable, increasing dividends, and (ii) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and common shares. 
Our primary strategy to achieve our business objective is to utilize our physician and hospital relationships nationwide to identify off-market opportunities in which to invest and own, to manage a diversified portfolio of high-quality health care properties, and to understand our tenants’ real estate strategies, which we believe will drive high retention, high occupancy, and reliable, increasing rental revenue cash flow and growth.
We intend to grow our portfolio of high-quality health care properties leased to physicians, hospitals, health care delivery systems, and other health care providers primarily through acquisitions of existing health care facilities and development of new health care facilities that provide or will provide stable revenue growth and predictable long-term cash flows. We may also selectively finance the development of new health care facilities with premier health care real estate developers. Generally, we expect to make investments in new development properties, whether self-developed or through third party developers, when approximately 80% or more of the development property has been pre-leased before construction commences. We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound health care 
providers and health care delivery systems that offer need-based health care services in sustainable health care markets. We focus our investment activity on MOBs, ASCs, outpatient treatment facilities, and other real estate integral to health care providers.

We may from time to time also make investments in other health care properties. We believe that trends such as shifting consumer preferences, limited space in hospitals, the desires of patients and health care providers to limit non-essential services provided in a hospital setting, and cost considerations continue to drive the industry towards performing more procedures in outpatient facilities instead of hospital settings. As these trends continue, we believe that demand for MOBs and similar health care properties away from hospital settings and in convenient locations to patients will continue to rise. We intend to exploit this trend and favor outpatient facilities consistent with our investment philosophy and strategies.
While not our focus, we may decide to invest opportunistically in life science facilities, senior housing properties, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals, and treatment centers. Consistent with the Trust’s qualification as a REIT, we may also opportunistically invest in companies that provide health care services, and in joint ventures with operating partners structured to comply with the REIT Investment Diversification Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”).
As of December 31, 2022, we have grown our consolidated portfolio of gross real estate investments to approximately $5.8 billion while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. For short-term funding purposes, we may borrow from our unsecured credit facility. From time to time, we replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes, equity, and alternative securities. We may selectively utilize capital market transactions in furtherance of our investment strategy.
Business Strategy
We are focused on maintaining and expanding our portfolio of high-quality health care properties leased to physicians, hospitals, health care delivery systems, and other health care providers. Our strategy includes the following key attributes:
•We seek to invest in properties occupied by health care systems with dominant market shares and high credit quality, especially those who are investing capital in their facilities. In particular, we seek to acquire off-market or selectively marketed assets with attractive demographics, economic growth, and high barriers to entry. We seek to own well-occupied properties that we believe are critical to the delivery of health care by affiliated hospital providers in desirable locations.
•We emphasize ensuring an appropriate and balanced mix of tenants and practices to provide synergies within individual buildings and broader health system campuses. Our primary tenants are health care systems, academic medical centers, and leading physician groups, which typically have strong and stable financial performance. We believe this helps ensure stability in our rental income and tenant retention over time.
•We seek to maintain a core, critical portfolio of properties and to build our reputation as a leading dedicated MOB owner and operator.
•We seek to maintain or increase our average rental rates, actively lease our vacant space, and reduce leasing concessions.
•We also intend to grow our portfolio through the development of new health care facilities. We may also selectively finance the development of new health care facilities with premier health care real estate developers. Generally, we expect to make investments in new development properties, whether self-developed or through third party developers, when approximately 80% or more of the development property has been pre-leased before construction commences. 
We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound health care providers and health care delivery systems that offer need-based health care services in sustainable health care markets and consider the potential for long-term relationships and repeat business when assessing acquisition potential.
We actively manage our balance sheet to maintain our investment grade credit rating, to maintain an appropriate level of leverage, and to preserve financing flexibility for funding of future acquisitions. In particular, we:
•Seek to maintain a high level of liquidity, including borrowing availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
•Maintain access to multiple sources of capital, including private and public debt markets, public equity markets, bank loan markets, and private equity and joint venture partners.
•Periodically review our portfolio to consider the potential dispositions of lower quality properties to reinvest the proceeds into higher quality properties.
•Closely monitor our existing debt maturities and average interest rates, and identify refinancing opportunities.
Sustainability Strategy
Since our founding in 2013, the Company has established a track record of environmental stewardship, value creation at the community level, and strong governance. We are also committed to increased transparency and accountability through public disclosure. We believe that sustainable investments are investments in a brighter future. We are committed to being a leader in Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) performance in the real estate industry. Our ESG Committee, a management and employee-led committee, formed in 2018, is overseen by our Executive Vice President of Asset Management, who reports to the Company’s President and CEO. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Trustees (“Board”) provides Board-level oversight of the ESG Committee. Company employees from every workgroup are represented on the ESG Committee. We began issuing our annual ESG Reports in June of 2020.
Our ESG achievements in 2022 include the following:
•Achieved a GRESB Public Disclosure Level score of 98 out of 100, ranking first in our health care comparison group;
•Earned a Green Star rating and a score of 75 out of 100 from the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) for the second consecutive year;
•Recognized with a 2022-2023 Green Lease Leaders Platinum Certification by the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) and the DOE Better Buildings Alliance, the only health care REIT attaining this designation;
•Merited ENERGY STAR Certification Nation Premier Member status by receiving 16 new property certifications, totaling 26 certifications since 2021;
•Earned 10 new Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM®) Certified Sustainable Property designations, totaling 38 certifications since 2019;
•Achieved an ISS ESG Corporate “Prime” rating, recognizing our dedication to ESG performance and disclosure;
•Honored as a Modern Healthcare Best Places to Work for the second consecutive year; and
•Recognized as a Top Workplaces recipient from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel for the fifth consecutive year.
More recently, in January 2023, we were named to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index as a first-time submitter.
We are committed to giving back to the communities we serve. In 2022, the Company provided more than $408,800 in philanthropic, fundraising, and in-kind donations to community and health care provider organizations, benefiting their research and mission initiatives, surpassing our 2022 goal of $375,000 by 9%.
Under the Company’s “volunteer time off” employee benefit program and Company volunteerism efforts, our employees contributed approximately 902 hours of community service in 2022. Employees are encouraged to spend a day - with pay - volunteering for an organization in their home community. In addition, the Company organizes volunteer service opportunities as a corporate outing, benefiting charitable causes while building teamwork, leadership skills, and fostering our Company culture. For more details on our social responsibility strategies, see the discussion under Item 1 - “Business” under “Human Capital Management.”
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”)
The Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by SASB proposes sustainability accounting metrics designed for disclosure in mandatory filings. SASB recommendations serve as the framework against which we have aligned our disclosures for sustainability information. 
Energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters and assured by a third party. The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include:
•energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area (“Energy Use Intensity”); 
•total energy consumed by portfolio area (“Total Energy Consumption”); 
•water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area (“Water Intensity”); and
•total water withdrawn by portfolio area (“Total Water Consumption”).
The charts below detail our Energy Intensity, Total Energy Consumption, Water Intensity, and Total Water Consumption for 2018 through 2021, for which data on occupied and actively managed properties was available. Total energy use is presented in gigajoules (“GJ”), and total water is presented per thousand cubic meters (“M3”). (1)(1)Full 2022 calendar year energy and water data will not be available to be assured by a third party until the second quarter of 2023. 2021 is the most recent year for which complete energy and water data is available and assured by a third party. The charts reflect the performance of 4.5 million square feet as of December 31, 2021, which was approximately 27% of our portfolio and approximately 39% of our actively managed portfolio. The energy scope includes energy produced from fuel, gas, district cooling, and electricity. The water scope includes irrigation and domestic water.
Energy Reduction Strategy
Energy reduction is a significant part of our capital improvement strategy as well as our property management training and engagement. We proactively track our assets to determine where capital upgrades, such as LED retrofits and building control systems optimizations, will maximize our efficiency impact.
Water Reduction Strategy
The Company utilizes water management policies, low-flow fixtures, and tenant education as part of our long-term mitigation strategies. We also work to optimize property irrigation systems based upon weather conditions and other environmental factors. 
Climate Change Adaptation
Approximately 229,100 square feet of the 4.5 million square feet referenced in the chart above, representing three of our medical office buildings, are located in 100-year flood zones designated by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) as special flood hazard areas (“SFHA”). No other tracked properties are located in a SFHA.
Climate Resilience
We are focused on climate preparedness as part of our sustainability strategy. As a long-term owner and active manager of our real estate assets, we proactively identify climate risks and implement preventive measures to combat these risks. Responsibility for these measures is distributed across several departments within the Company, including Executive Leadership, Asset Management, Construction and Project Management, Leasing, Marketing and Communications, and Property Management. In 2020, the Company implemented certain recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (“TCFD”) and expanded these efforts in 2021. By utilizing data provided by an independent third party expert, the team identified properties exposed to climate risks in seven key categories: flood, earthquake, heat stress, hurricane, sea-level rise, water stress, and wildfire. In addition, we identified the properties with a “Red Flag” or “High” risk in any of the above categories and committed to creating a mitigation plan for each affected location. Our annual ESG Report is prepared in alignment with TCFD and includes details on these risks and subsequent mitigation plans.
Reporting
A notable part of our sustainability platform is transparent reporting of ESG performance indicators, as we recognize the importance of this information to investors and other key stakeholders in understanding how the Company assesses sustainability information and evaluates risks and opportunities. We publish an annual ESG report that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting standards and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The Company’s ESG Report includes our strategy, key performance indicators, annual like-for-like comparisons, and achievements. The report is available on our website at http://www.docreit.com/esg. Information contained on our website is not part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ISOS Group, Inc. conducted an independent third-party, moderate-level assurance of environmental data, including energy, water, waste, and greenhouse gas emissions calculations for the calendar year ended December 31, 2021. This moderate assurance engagement was performed under the AccountAbility 1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS) and with reference to ISO 14064-3: Specification with guidance for the validation and assurance of greenhouse gas assertions, World Resources Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, and WRI/WBCSD The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. 
Our Industry and Market Opportunity 
The nature of health care delivery continues to evolve due to the impact of government programs, regulatory changes and consumer preferences. We believe these changes have increased the need for capital among health care providers and increased pressure on these providers to integrate more efficient real estate solutions in order enhance the delivery of quality health care. In particular, we believe the following factors and trends are creating an attractive environment in which to invest in health care properties.
$4.5 Trillion Health Care Industry Projected to Grow to $6.8 Trillion (19.6% of U.S. GDP by 2030)
According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), health care spending accounted for 19.7% of U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) in 2020. Near-term National Health Expenditure (“NHE”) patterns have been significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to CMS’ National Health Expenditure Projections 2021-2030, NHE growth in 2021 was projected to slow to 4.2 percent (down from 9.7 percent growth in 2020) as federal COVID-19 supplemental funding declined substantially. Following the declines observed in 2020 health care utilization is expected to rebound and normalize through 2024. The general aging of the population, driven by the Baby Boomer generation and advances in medical technology and services, which increase life expectancy, are expected to continue to be key drivers of the growth in health care expenditures. The anticipated continuing increase in demand for health care services, together with an evolving complex and costly regulatory environment, changes in medical technology and reductions in government reimbursements are expected to pressure capital-constrained health care providers to find cost effective solutions for their real estate needs.
We believe the demand by health care providers for health care real estate will increase as health care spending in the United States rebounds and continues to increase. According to the CMS’ National Health Expenditure Projections 2021-2030, NHEs are projected to grow 5.1 percent per year to $6.8 trillion by 2030, resulting in a projected NHE share of GDP of 19.6% in 2030.

Aging Population
The aging of the U.S. population has a direct effect on the demand for health care as older persons generally utilize health care services at a rate well in excess of younger people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to more than double from 49.2 million to nearly 94.7 million, and the 85 and older population is expected to almost triple, from 6.4 million to 19.0 million, between 2016 and 2060. Also, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of older Americans is growing as a percentage of the total U.S. population with the number of persons older than 65 estimated to comprise 15.2% of the total U.S. population in 2016 and projected to grow to more than 20% by 2030.
We believe health care expenditures for the population over 65 years of age will continue to rise as a disproportionate share of health care dollars is spent on older Americans. To illustrate, in 2012 the elderly (65+ years old) represented only 14% of the population while accounting for 34% of all health care-related spending. We believe the older population group increasingly will require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments and that this increased demand for health care services will create a substantial need for additional medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the health care industry in many regions of the United States. Additionally, we believe there will likely be a focus on lowering the cost of outpatient care for the aging U.S. population, which will continue to support medical office and outpatient facility property demand in the long term. For example, beginning in 2019, CMS expanded the list of procedures that can be performed and reimbursed in outpatient surgery centers to include 12 cardiac catheterization diagnostic procedures and 5 ancillary procedures. CMS further expanded the list of services for 2023. We believe these trends will result in a substantial increase in the demand for health care space in our facilities and the number of properties meeting our investment criteria.
We believe advances in medical technology will continue to enable health care providers to identify and treat once fatal illnesses and improve the survival rate of critically ill and injured patients who will require continuing medical care in outpatient medical office buildings.

Affordable Care Act 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”) constituted a significant overhaul of many aspects of health care regulations and health insurance and created new features in the framework for health care services over the near term. It required every American to have health insurance or be subjected to a tax. Those who cannot afford health insurance are offered insurance subsidies or Medicaid coverage. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate was unconstitutional. The United States Supreme Court dismissed the Texas case and upheld the Affordable Care Act in June 2021; however, we expect challenges to the Affordable Care Act may continue.
The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 50 million Americans did not have health care insurance in 2009, before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The U.S. Census Bureau calculated that in 2021, approximately 27.2 million Americans did not have health insurance, continuing a trend after passage of the Affordable Care Act to reduce the number of uninsured and representing a decrease in the uninsured rate from 2020 (28.3 million). The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation, executive orders and events, as well as their potential impact on our business, are discussed more fully under Item 1 - Business, under the caption “Certain Government Regulations.”
We believe an increase in the number of Americans with access to health insurance would result in an increase in physician office visits and an overall rise in health care utilization which in turn will drive a need for expansion of medical, outpatient, and smaller specialty hospital facilities. We also believe the increased dissemination of health research through media outlets, marketing of health care products, and availability of advanced screening techniques and medical procedures have contributed to a more engaged population of health care users and has created increased demand for customized facilities providing specialized, preventive, and integrative health care services. With the growth of electronic health care information transmission, physician offices increasingly engage with patients through telehealth. Health care payors, including Medicare, are beginning to reimburse for telehealth services when medical information is transmitted and used between patients and physicians. Telehealth services have also expanded as a result of COVID-19 and the need for social distancing, a trend we expect to continue following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency.
We further believe the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are designed to lower certain reimbursement amounts under Medicare and tie reimbursement levels to the quality of services provided will increase the pressure on health care providers to become more efficient in their business models, invest capital in their businesses, lower costs and improve the quality of care, which in turn will drive health care systems to monetize their real estate assets and create demand for new, modern and specialized facilities.
Clinical Care Continues to Shift to Outpatient Care
According to the American Hospital Association (the “AHA”), many procedures traditionally performed in hospitals, such as certain types of surgery, are increasingly moving to outpatient facilities driven by advances in clinical science, shifting consumer preferences, limited or inefficient space in existing hospitals, and lower costs in the outpatient environment. This continuing shift toward delivering health care services in an outpatient environment rather than a traditional hospital environment increases the need for additional outpatient facilities and smaller, more specialized and efficient hospitals. Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and others have shown that health care is delivered more cost effectively and with higher patient satisfaction when it is provided on an outpatient basis. Increasingly, hospital admissions are reserved for the critically ill, and less critical patients are treated on an outpatient basis with recuperation in their own homes. We believe health care market trends toward outpatient care will continue to push health care services out of larger, older, inefficient hospitals and into newer, more efficient, and conveniently located outpatient facilities and smaller specialized hospitals. We believe that increased specialization within the medical field is also driving demand for medical facilities designed specifically for particular specialties and that physicians want to locate their practices in medical office space that is in or adjacent to these facilities.
Impact of BBA on Hospital Outpatient Care
Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the “2015 BBA”) generally prohibits hospital outpatient departments (“HOPDs”) from receiving hospital outpatient department rates under the Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) for Medicare patients treated in “off-campus” locations that are not Emergency Departments on or after January 1, 2017, potentially impacting their profitability. These higher Medicare hospital outpatient rates are only permitted if the hospital provides HOPD services in a department within 250 yards of the hospital’s main inpatient building, or within 250 yards of a hospital’s remote location (second inpatient location off the main campus). A hospital HOPD can be grandfathered from the 2015 BBA payment changes even if the location is outside the 250 yard distance. Under the statutory authority, an off-campus HOPD facility that was furnishing outpatient services on or before November 2, 2015 can be “grandfathered” and can continue to be paid at the OPPS HOPD rates, if, among other things, the hospital was billing HOPD services in that location on a HOPD basis as of November 2, 2015 and continues to provide those services in that location. On November 21, 2018, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”) issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2019, that eliminates the higher, OPPS reimbursement rate for evaluation and management (“E&M”) services provided by Grandfathered HOPD locations (the “Final Rule”). The Secretary, instead, will only reimburse for E&M services at the lower, Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rate that new non-grandfathered off-campus HOPD locations receive. The AHA and a number of hospitals sued the Secretary in federal court to enforce the plain meaning of Section 603 of the 2015 BBA and restore the right to Grandfathered HOPD reimbursement rates. On September 17, 2019, a federal district judge ruled in favor of the AHA. The court stated that CMS did not have the authority to lower payments for off-campus hospital-based departments that were grandfathered under the 2015 BBA. CMS challenged this ruling and requested a stay in the decision, which the court denied on October 21, 2019. In its December 15, 2020 final rule for hospital OPPS rates, CMS continued its efforts to lower payment for certain HOPD services basing reductions on the principle of “site neutrality.” These lower payment levels were effective January 1, 2021, notwithstanding the CMS’ projections that overall payments under OPPS will increase by 2.4%. For 2023, CMS updated OPPS payment rates for hospitals that meet applicable quality reporting requirements by 3.8%. Further, CMS continued the payment rate reduction for E&M services furnished in all off-campus HOPDS in 2022. CMS stated that it intends to continue this policy in calendar year 2022 and beyond. Hospitals with “grandfathered” locations providing HOPD services in our portfolio are referred to as 603 assets in our SEC reports and other public disclosures.
We own a number of 603 assets. Rent derived from these 603 assets accounts for approximately 16% of our total consolidated portfolio annualized base rent as of December 31, 2022. Depending upon the implementation of the regulations and mix of procedures in an HOPD, the 2015 BBA may enhance the value of these 603 assets because existing HOPDs may lose their higher reimbursements rates should they choose to change locations, thus enhancing lease renewal probabilities and rent growth.
Portfolio Summary

Please see Item 2 - “Properties” for a table that summarizes our consolidated portfolio as of December 31, 2022.
Geographic Concentration

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 12.0% of our consolidated gross leasable area was derived from properties located in Texas. 
As a result of this geographic concentration, we are particularly exposed to downturns in the Texas economy or other changes in local real estate market conditions. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental, or competitive conditions in Texas could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results. In the event of negative economic or other changes in the Texas market, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, and the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected. See the discussion under Item 1A - “Risk Factors”, under the caption, “Economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas in which we conduct business, and in particular Texas, and other areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
Customer Concentration

We receive substantially all of our revenue as rent payments from tenants under leases of space in our health care properties, with our five largest tenants based upon rental revenue representing approximately $70.1 million, or 19.5%, of the annualized base rent from our consolidated properties as of December 31, 2022. No one tenant represents more than 5.0% of our total consolidated annualized base rent; however, 14.8% of our total consolidated annualized base rent as of December 31, 2022 is from tenants affiliated with CommonSpirit. We have no control over the success or failure of our tenants’ businesses and, at any time, any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. Our business, financial position, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if CommonSpirit were to experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, or results of operations.
Competition

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of health care properties, including national, regional and local operators, acquirers, and developers of health care-related real estate properties and other investors such as private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The competition for health care-related real estate properties may significantly increase the price that we must pay for health care properties or other assets that we seek to acquire, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs that target health care properties may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, enhanced operating efficiencies, more personnel, and market penetration and familiarity with markets. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. Increased competition would result in increased demand for the same assets and therefore increase prices paid for them. Those higher prices for health care properties or other assets may adversely affect our returns from our investments.
We also face competition in leasing available MOBs and other facilities that serve the health care industry to prospective tenants. As a result, we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, offer other inducements, or we may be unable to timely lease vacant space in our properties, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
Seasonality

Our business has not been, and we do not expect it to become, subject to material seasonal fluctuations.

Human Capital Management
Our Company is focused on human capital management, which our Board believes is vital to the health of the Company. We believe that the success of our business depends on a strong, talented, and committed workforce to ensure excellence on behalf of our clients and shareholders. Therefore, we prioritize the well-being of our employees and offer comprehensive benefits packages, opportunities for personal and group volunteer efforts, and paths for life-long learning to our employees. Our employees work with various business units across the Company to diversify their skill sets. Employees are offered challenging projects, stock ownership as a form of compensation, and a collaborative and inclusive environment with exposure to our top executives.
We are an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed to making employment decisions without regard to race, creed, color, religion, sex, age, ancestry, national origin, sexual preference, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, protected veteran status, or any other legally protected status. As of December 31, 2022, we had 101 full-time employees, none of whom were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are positive.
The nominating and corporate governance committee retains oversight over human capital matters, including diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and initiatives, and oversees the Company's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) Council. Our Board receives regular reports from our CEO regarding annual employee engagement results conducted through an independent third party. In 2022, the Company had approximately 95% participation in this survey, representing a year-over-year increase in participation of over 2%. We are pleased to report that in 2022 our employee retention rate is 94%, a year-over-year increase of over 4%. Our Board members periodically attend employee events, participate in our annual Management Summit event, and attend all-team holiday gatherings. Also, in 2022, as part of the Company’s ongoing Women in Leadership series, we were honored to have the newest member of our Board of Trustees, Ava Lias-Booker, Esq., hold a leadership discussion with our employees during a company-wide meeting. In January 2023, we were named to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index as a first-time submitter.
Employee Engagement
In 2022, the Company offered team member training, including courses on leadership, work/life balance, mental health, and cybersecurity, among other topics. Our team also routinely participates in training opportunities related to ESG and workplace best practices to pursue continued professional development. In addition, employees participate in an annual book club discussion and training events, including regular Company-wide “lunch and learn” discussions on leadership, wellness, mentorship, team-building, the REIT industry, and advanced computer skills.
At Physicians Realty Trust, our employees are heavily invested in building a stronger and more inclusive workplace environment. Employees lead committees focusing on social, environmental, philanthropic, and health and wellness topics that shape the Company’s policies. As mentioned above, annual engagement surveys are conducted by an independent third party to provide anonymous team member feedback, the response rate to this survey was approximately 95% in 2022. We believe that continuous improvement and investment in our team are the keys to our continued success.
The Company also created a new Culture Specialist position to focus on sustaining and improving our culture. In addition to day-to-day human resource responsibilities, the Culture Specialist will support our employees’ general health, well-being, and engagement by fostering a strong, supportive, and productive work environment. Prioritizing our most important asset--our people--through this position, especially in an era of hybrid working environments, we expect will ensure a sense of belonging and shared mission to energize our Company in the future.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
The Company values diversity and embraces the unique qualities of our employees. In 2019, we formed our DEI Council, which sets ambitious, attainable, and authentic goals, develops educational platforms, and plans activities to promote DEI at all levels of our organization, creating a culture of fairness and respect for our employees. We believe we are a stronger organization when our workforce represents a diversity of ideas and experiences. 
We take a personalized approach, driven by a 20-member DEI Council that represents all workgroups within our Company. Strategies include attracting and retaining top talent while intentionally including diverse candidates in recruitment efforts, providing enhanced career development support, and supporting DEI awareness and education for our employees.
Our DEI Council, which meets monthly, operates under the direction and full support of our Senior Vice President and Deputy Chief of Investments, who reports on activities to our President and CEO. In addition, the DEI Council is overseen by the nominating and corporate governance committee and reports to the entire Board as needed. We feel that this level of visibility leads to high engagement, accountability, and fulfillment of our DEI goals.
2022 Successes
At DOC, our longstanding commitment to our health care partners and the patients they serve is to C.A.R.E.: Collaborate and Communicate, Act with Integrity, Respect the Relationship, and Execute Consistently. Each of these values is reflected in our DEI Council and its work to ensure our actions reflect our DEI values and help us achieve our goals.
Our 2022 successes tie directly to our Company’s shared vision to C.A.R.E.:
Collaborate and Communicate
Build CRE Diversity Pipeline: In 2022, the Company surpassed its goal to hire 50% or more diverse candidates in our summer internship program, representing those who identify as Black, Indigenous, people of color, female, veteran, or LGBTQIA+. This goal supports our efforts to build a young, diverse, and talented leadership pipeline. In addition, all internal and external candidate recruitment focuses on seeking diverse candidates, using organizations, resources, and job boards with diverse followings.
Support Company Education via Communications Channels: The DEI Council provided educational touchpoints via the Company’s new SharePoint DEI Hub site with over 6,000-lifetime site visits to date. To promote transparency, resources include news stories, Council files, our DEI mission statement, working goals, meeting schedules, DEI Council member directory, and an anonymous, third-party administered team suggestion box. The Council also authors news articles based on team interviews and research on holidays, traditions, and observances to promote understanding and inclusion.
Industry Representation: We are also proud of our 2022 representation on the Nareit Communications Council, DEI Working Group, Real Estate Sustainability Council, and Social Responsibility Council, and our employees regularly attend continuing education on DEI matters through Nareit conferences.
Act with Integrity
Attract Top Talent: The DEI Council conducted a comprehensive benefits review to ensure the Company remains competitive in our offerings to current and prospective employees. As a result, recommendations that we anticipate will be implemented in 2023 include a wellness incentives program and an onboarding Buddy Program for new hires to foster connections and professional development.
Wraparound Tools for Mental Health and Wellness: In a Company survey conducted in January 2022, mental health and work/life balance were the most-requested topics for DEI programming. The Company took a holistic approach, offering over eight hours of mental health programming, paid access to an award-winning mental health and wellness app, and a new yearly paid time off day for mental health and wellness. We also provided resources surrounding observances of World Mental Health Day, Mental Health Awareness Month, and Stress Awareness Day.
Create a Consistent Feedback Loop to Further Belonging and Allyship: The DEI Council added DEI touchpoint questions to quarterly manager/team member reviews and measured engagement/perception of DEI through a new yearly survey. Participation in this survey increased by 11% year-over-year, and positive responses increased in every category. Separately, the DEI Council also incorporated gender identity, sexual orientation, and allyship questions in our annual anonymous top workplaces survey administered through a third party to better understand and support our internal diversity.
Respect the Relationship
Mentor Diverse Future Leaders: In 2022, the Company continued its ongoing partnership with Year Up, a national organization whose mission connects talented young adults and top companies to launch careers, power businesses, and build communities. Our activities included virtual networking events and mock interviews that have fostered ongoing mentorships between our employees and recent program graduates.
Financial Investments: In coordination with NAIOP Wisconsin and the Marquette University Center for Real Estate, the Company supported the MKE CRE week-long summer immersion program through financial investments and as a key event organizer. This organization's mission is to expose diverse high school students to career opportunities in commercial real estate. Students learned about designing, building, managing, owning, and selling commercial real estate through in-person instruction, hands-on experiences, site visits, and intentional interaction with real estate professionals working locally and across the country. In addition, the Company provided $7,500 in financial support, as a Presenting Sponsor, toward scholarships for diverse high school students interested in careers in commercial real estate.
Execute Consistently
Execute Team Programming: The Company offered four All-Team Lunch & Learn sessions on generational diversity, work/life balance, mental health, and intersectionality. These sessions included video watch parties, guest speakers, breakouts, and lively group discussions. The DEI Council also debuted three optional, informal, and small-group “Coffee Talks” to discuss 
working styles and recognition differences, imposter syndrome, and perfectionism. Also, in 2022, as part of the Company’s ongoing DEI-led Women in Leadership series, we were honored to host the newest member of our Board of Trustees, Ava Lias-Booker, Esq. The Council also assisted in selecting two topics and speakers for the Company’s 2022 Management Summit - a virtual breakout on conflict de-escalation strategies geared toward property management professionals and our 2022 main stage keynote session on tactical negotiation strategies, utilizing tools such as a DEI lens.
Share our Progress to Date: We were proud to be honored as the 2022 CRE Insight Journal “Excellence in DEI” Award Winner, recognizing the culture of transparency and integrity that guides our business and shapes our strategy in addressing DEI opportunities for positive change.
Looking Ahead
Our team continues to develop targeted DEI goals to make a tangible and meaningful impact on our Company, industry, and communities, ultimately advancing DEI principles and better business performance. Our forthcoming ESG Report will showcase our efforts in greater detail.
Beginning in 2023, our long-term incentive plan includes a DEI element as part of our new ESG scorecard, with a goal of providing annual training to all employees with 100% participation.
COVID-19 Response
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized our employees’ health and safety. In 2022, to encourage and support COVID-19 vaccination, the Company provided one paid “wellness day” to allow our employees to get vaccinated and deal with any immediate side effects. Employees could also use their wellness day for overall mental health and wellness. In addition, in 2022, the Company took a wraparound approach to increase mental health support for employees by also facilitating communication and education related to mental health and wellness. These efforts included a Company-wide, team-led town hall discussion facilitated by a licensed clinical psychologist. The Company also held a small group “Coffee Talk” series on mental health related to perfectionism and imposter syndrome. Finally, the Company supported mental health through a new benefit: paid access to a mental health and wellness app. 
In addition, we supported various COVID-19 relief efforts alongside our health care partners across the country. Our past efforts have included donating supplies, allowing local government agencies to store personal protective equipment at our facilities, establishing a temporary COVID-19 vaccine site at one of our facilities available for lease, establishing and managing drive-through COVID-19 testing locations at our facilities, and coordinating COVID-19 screening at building entrances. 
Compensation and Benefits
Our leadership has championed the importance of providing a robust benefits package. We offer competitive pay and compensation packages, including an annual bonus, paid medical and dental insurance, paid time off benefits, paid holidays, yearly paid volunteer time off, one paid mental health and wellness day, summer Friday hours, 401(k) match with immediate vesting, Company-sponsored short- and long-term disability benefits, voluntary life and accident insurance, paid parental leave, and pet insurance. We provide equity compensation after six months of employment. Through our employee stock purchase program and annual stock grant, our employees are also owners of the Company. The Company also offers a health plan option with a health savings account, which to date, has included an annual company contribution, an onsite gym in Milwaukee, and numerous team-building activities throughout the year.
One of the Company’s continuing education benefits, our graduate degree sponsorship program, is awarded based on a competitive submission process. In 2022, we were proud to celebrate the graduation of a team member who earned her master’s degree in accounting. This program was launched in 2019 and has two graduates.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has adopted a hybrid return-to-work approach tailored to the decisions and responsibilities of each workgroup, including several fully remote work options, which we believe will maximize company-wide productivity. Additionally, the Company has a yearly four-week “work from anywhere” policy.
Community and Philanthropy 
The Company provides monetary support to various nonprofit organizations. In 2022, the Company contributed over $408,800 in philanthropy giving, exceeding our 2022 goal of $375,000. Separately, we fundraised $150,000 to support charitable causes nationwide. Employees are actively involved in the Company’s philanthropic decisions through a team-led 
committee, an annual philanthropy survey, and quarterly “Jeans Week” drives with charitable recipients chosen from team-nominated organizations nationwide. The Company does not make contributions of any kind to any political action committees or political candidates or their campaigns.
Under the Company all-team volunteerism efforts, our employees contributed 455 hours through Company-sponsored team volunteer opportunities in 2022.
Additionally, through the Company’s Volunteer Time Off (VTO) program launched in 2019, we encourage and empower our employees to give back to the community in personally meaningful ways. In 2022, our employees spent 447 hours serving their communities individually, representing a 47% year-over-year increase in usage of the Company’s VTO program. This change was primarily driven by a new VTO team-based challenge that created meaningful opportunities for our team to bond over shared causes while encouraging each other to take full advantage of these opportunities to make a difference. The winning team collectively completed over 80% of their total possible VTO hours, and the Company contributed to the charity of their choice in recognition of this effort.
Environmental Matters

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties even if we no longer own such properties. See the discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning, leasing, developing, and operating our properties may affect our results of operations.”
Certain Government Regulations
Overview

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local health care laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure, protection of patient health information, and certificate of need (“CON”) and similar laws governing the operation of health care facilities, and we expect that the health care industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, health care management, and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our health care properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “The health care industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws and regulations, health policies, reimbursement levels from third-party payors, loss of licensure, or failure to obtain licensure could adversely impact our company and result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.”
In 2017, Congress came within a single vote of repealing of the Affordable Care Act and substantially reducing funding to the Medicaid program. New legislation may be introduced in the future, proposing changes, if not full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Beyond this, significant changes to commercial health insurance and government-sponsored insurance (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) remain possible. Commercial and government payors are likely to continue imposing larger discounts and tighter cost controls upon operators, through reductions in reimbursement rates and changes in payment methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise. A shift toward less comprehensive health insurance coverage and increased consumer cost-sharing on health expenditures could have a material adverse effect on certain of our operators’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases.
The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.

Health Care Legislation
Health Reform Laws. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the Affordable Care Act (collectively with other subsequently enacted federal health care laws and regulations, the “Health Reform Laws”). The Health Reform Laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties. Some provisions of the Health Reform Laws may have a positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues, by, for example, increasing coverage of uninsured individuals, while others may have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by, for example, altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities. The Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants, in the event of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws. In addition, there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective employees. The Health Reform Laws also provide additional Medicaid funding to allow states to carry out the expansion of Medicaid coverage to certain financially eligible individuals beginning in 2014, and have also permitted states to expand their Medicaid coverage to these individuals since April 1, 2010, if certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allows states not to participate in the expansion-and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion-without losing their existing Medicaid funding. As of December 1, 2022, 12 states have pursued the option not to adopt the Medicaid expansion. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but could also further strain state budgets. While the federal government paid for approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states now are expected to pay for part of those additional costs. 
Challenges to the Health Reform Laws and Potential Repeal and/or Further Reforms under Trump Administration. Since the enactment of the Health Reform Laws, there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenge to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws, including the case that was before the U.S. Supreme Court, King v. Burwell. Although the Supreme Court in Burwell upheld the use of subsidies to individuals in federally facilitated health care exchanges on June 25, 2015, which ultimately did not disrupt significantly the implementation of the Health Reform Laws, we cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal, amend or challenge the validity of all or part of the Health Reform Laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal, amendment or challenge would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us.
In 2017, then President Trump and Congress unsuccessfully sought to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On January 20, 2017, then President Trump issued an Executive Order stating that it was the administration’s official policy to repeal the Affordable Care Act and instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authority and responsibility under the Affordable Care Act to, among other matters, delay implementation of or grant an exemption from any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, health care providers, health insurers, patients, and others. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. The Tax Act, among other things, reduces the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate penalty to zero beginning in 2019. The elimination of the penalties does not remove the requirement to obtain health care coverage; however, without penalties there effectively will be no enforcement. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate was unconstitutional. The court also ruled that the provisions of the individual mandate were not severable from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act, rendering the remainder of the Affordable Care Act invalid as well. President Biden formally revoked former President Trump’s Executive Order regarding the Affordable Care Act on January 28, 2021. The United States Supreme Court heard the Texas case following a series of appeals and dismissed the case and upheld the Affordable Care Act in June 2021. Despite action by the current administration and the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act, it is possible that Congress will continue to consider other legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act or repeal and replace some or all elements of the Affordable Care Act.
The US Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued a final rule on June 21, 2018 authorizing the creation of Association Health Plans (“AHP”). This rule was one of three components of a 2017 Executive Order to increase consumer health insurance options and also created short-term limited duration health insurance and health reimbursement arrangements. On March 28, 2019, the US District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the AHP. On April 26, 2019, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) appealed that decision and the appeal is ongoing.
On June 24, 2019, then President Trump signed an Executive Order on Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Health Care to Put Patients First. The order was intended to increase the availability of meaningful price and quality information for patients. CMS included in its final rule for Medicare hospital outpatient payment, the requirement that hospitals 

make public their standard charges, along with payer-specific negotiated rates, in a consumer-friendly format. This requirement was to be effective January 1, 2020. In 2019, the AHA and other hospital groups initiated litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and CMS to prevent implementation of this price transparency rule. The AHA challenge was unsuccessful and the rule became effective January 1, 2021. The public availability of hospital charges may give patients information to select physician office-based care rather than in the hospital. 
We cannot predict the effect of Trump or Biden Executive Orders, the Tax Act’s 2019 repeal of the individual mandate penalty on the Affordable Care Act, or whether future attempts by Congress to challenge or change the law will be successful. Further, we cannot predict how the Affordable Care Act might be amended or modified, either through the legislative or judicial process, and how any such modification might impact our tenants’ operations or the net effect of this law on us. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by any repeal or modification of the law, our revenue and operations may be materially adversely affected as well.
No Surprises Act. Effective January 1, 2022, facilities and providers must comply with several new policies required by No Surprises Act (“NSA”). Specifically, the NSA prohibits “balance billing” for: (i) emergency services provided by an out-of-network provider; and (ii) non-emergency (e.g., scheduled) services provided by an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility. For such out-of-network services, health plans are prohibited from imposing higher cost-sharing amounts (i.e., copayment, coinsurance, or deductible) than the amount that would have applied had the service been provided by an in-network provider. The NSA allows the patient to waive their balance billing and cost-sharing protections in some scenarios, but this requires the out-of-network provider to comply with the patient notice and consent requirements under the Act, and does not apply to most ancillary physician services (e.g., emergency, radiology, anesthesiology, pathology, neonatology, and services provided by hospitalists, assistant surgeons, and intensivists). For purposes of compliance with the balance billing and patient cost-sharing protections, a “facility” is defined under the NSA to include hospitals, critical access hospitals, hospital outpatient departments, and ASCs.
The NSA also requires providers and facilities to provide a good faith estimate (“GFE”) of expected charges to uninsured and self-pay patients upon scheduling or upon request. HHS delayed enforcement of the GFE requirements for one year to allow providers and facilities to develop systems and processes for the exchange of required information between (i) the providers/facilities with which the primary service was initially scheduled or from which the GFE was initially requested and (ii) co-providers/co-facilities. That one‑year delay, however, proved insufficient as facilities and providers struggled to develop and implement solutions to comply with the GFE co-provider requirement in advance of the January 1, 2023, enforcement deadline, without any sub-regulatory or interpretive guidance from HHS.
In response to industry comments, HHS issued updated guidance in the form of an “FAQ,” which now delays enforcement of the GFE co-provider requirement until HHS issues additional guidance through formal rulemaking. Currently there is no new enforcement deadline, and according to the FAQ, any future rulemaking will include a prospective applicability date that gives providers and facilities “a reasonable amount of time to comply with any new requirements.” Nevertheless, the FAQ cautions that certain states are the primary enforcers of the GFE requirements, rather than the federal government. Those states do not have to follow HHS’ lead to delay enforcement of the co-provider requirement, though HHS encourages states to take a similar approach. Providers in states that are enforcing the GFE rules directly may have enhanced risk of enforcement at this time. While the balance billing and patient cost-sharing requirements (described above) do not apply to freestanding physician clinics, such freestanding clinics must comply with the GFE requirements under the NSA. The NSA requires providers and facilities to provide patients with disclosures of their new rights under the law.
The enforcement provisions under the NSA permit the Secretary to apply a civil monetary penalty against a provider/facility in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per violation of the NSA, including: (i) violations of the balance billing protections under the NSA (including all mandated disclosures and notices); and (ii) in circumstances where a provider/facility fails to provide a good faith estimate (“GFE”) of expected charges to uninsured/self-pay patients in violation of the NSA. Notably, the balance billing, patient cost sharing protections, and GFE requirements under NSA are in addition to any requirements under applicable state law. Many of our operators and tenants are now subject to these laws, and some of them may be subject to monetary penalties if they fail to comply with applicable laws.

Information Blocking
Published on May 1, 2020, the Information Blocking Regulations (“IB Regulations”) went into effect April 5, 2021. The IB Regulations prohibit “Actors” (e.g., health care providers, health information exchanges, health information technology developers) from taking action that is likely to interfere with, prevent or materially discourage access, exchange or use of electronic health information. The scope of the IB Regulations were recently expanded to prohibit health care providers from blocking or interfering with patient access to any electronic information in a “designated record set,” as the term is defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, commonly referred to as HIPAA, effective October 6, 2022. Except to the extent covered by an exception, the IB Regulations obligate an Actor to provide a requestor (a patient, a patient’s representative or person seeking a connection to the Actor’s technology) with access to the electronic health information (“EHI”) within its control or possession. The exceptions to the IB Regulations permit an Actor to deny access, limit the amount of access, delay access, condition the type of access or charge a fee for access, all subject to the detailed limitations stated in the applicable exception. Further guidance is pending from CMS and the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) regarding enforcement of the rule; however, exclusion and $1 million per violation civil monetary penalties have been cited as potential penalties. In addition to the potential for penalties, providers are likely to incur additional costs in training staff and updating medical records systems and policies to ensure appropriate access to medical records.
Fraud and Abuse Enforcement

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing health care providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state health care programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of health care items or services and the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”), an all-payor statute enacted in 2018 prohibiting kickbacks related to remuneration for referrals to recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities and laboratories, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain health care services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of health care fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state health care programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state, and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws.
Reimbursement

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among other sources, governmental health care programs, such as the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance payors, managed care organizations (“MCOs”), health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), and Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”). As federal and state governments focus on health care reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators.
We cannot predict whether future Congressional action will reduce physician reimbursements. Efforts by other payors to reduce health care costs are likely to continue, which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants. Further, revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. For example, payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. The Health Care Reform Laws and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government and private payments to health care providers. In some cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private health care insurance. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants to comply with various laws and regulations could lead to overpayments and resulting repayment obligations to, as well as jeopardize their ability to continue participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and other government sponsored payment 

programs. The financial impact on our tenants’ failure to comply with such laws and regulations could restrict their ability to make rent payments to us.

Health Care Licensure and CON

Certain health care facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure, certification and inspection laws, and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies and laboratories, handle radioactive materials, and operate equipment. Many states require certain health care providers to obtain a CON, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion, purchase of certain capital equipment, and closure of certain health care facilities. The approval process related to state CON laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses.
COVID-19 Pandemic
COVID-19 Relief. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act (2020) and the Coronavirus Response and Consolidated Appropriations Act (2021) (“CAA”) provided economic assistance for health care providers. The CAA continued many of these programs by adding new phases, new allocations, and new guidance to address issues related to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the CARES Act, the federal government authorized $175 billion in payments to be distributed through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (“Provider Relief Fund” or “PRF”). The CAA added another $3 billion in funding to the PRF program. The government has apportioned the PRF in several tranches, including (i) a $50 billion Phase 1 general distribution to Medicare providers, (ii) a $18 billion Phase 2 general distribution to Medicaid providers, (iii) a $24.5 billion Phase 3 general distribution based on financial losses and expenses attributable to COVID-19, and (iv) approximately $60 billion in targeted distributions to hospitals in high-impact areas and certain other specific providers.
Payments from the PRF are not loans and, therefore, they are generally not subject to repayment. However, as a condition to receiving distributions, providers must agree to certain terms and conditions, including, among other things, that the funds are being used for lost revenues and certain COVID-related expenses, and that the providers will not seek collection of out‑of‑pocket payments from a COVID-19 patient that are greater than what the patient would have otherwise been required to pay if the care had been provided by an in-network provider. Recipients of PRF payments must comply with reporting requirements described in the terms and conditions and specified in HHS reporting guidelines. HHS has indicated that it will be closely monitoring and, along with the OIG, auditing providers to ensure that recipients comply with the terms and conditions of the PRF program and to prevent fraud and abuse. Providers will be subject to civil and criminal penalties for any deliberate omissions, misrepresentations or falsifications of any information given to HHS. Noncompliance with applicable terms and conditions is grounds for HHS to recoup some or all of the payments made from the PRF. Further, HHS has indicated that PRF payments that have not been expended for permitted uses by applicable deadlines must be returned to HHS. Reporting obligations are ongoing for providers that accepted grants from the Provider Relief Fund and will continue into 2024. Notably, HHS has begun issuing Repayment Request Notices to recipients of PRF payments who are required to repay funds.
More recently, on December 10, 2021, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, extending the moratorium on the 2% Medicare sequestration until April 2022, then reducing the amount taken from payments to 1% for another three months. The law also prevents the statutory Pay-As-You-Go cuts to Medicare, which total 4% of Medicare payments, and certain rate cuts finalized in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule from November 2021. Additionally, the law will delay payment cuts for clinical laboratories and postpone the launch of the radiation oncology bundled payment model, which was slated to start in January 2022. These changes are intended to support the financial viability of physician practices and maintain access to outpatient care during the continuing public health emergency.
Based on the continued uncertainty around reporting and potential recoupment of PRF funds, we cannot provide any assurances as to whether any tenant or operator may be required to derecognize and return any portion of PRF funds it has recognized as income, or predict whether a tenant or operator may be eligible to receive any additional allocations of Provider Relief Funds in the future or whether it will be able to recognize such amounts as PRF grant income under HHS reporting requirements. There are also no assurances regarding the future of Medicare Physician Fee Schedule payments and scheduled reductions to payments thereunder. These ongoing risks will continue to create risk of non-payment of rent from our tenants.
Vaccine Mandates. On November 4, 2021, CMS released its Interim Final Rule (“IFR”) requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for individuals working in Medicare- and Medicaid-participating facilities, as well as individuals working in certain other settings involving face-to-face interactions with patients. On the same date, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) released its new Emergency Temporary Standard (“ETS”) requiring companies with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccination of their employees.

On January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court handed down a pair of decisions on the CMS vaccine mandate rule and the OSHA vaccine-or-test rule. In short, the Court ruled in its opinion that CMS is not prohibited from implementing its IFR. In a separate opinion, the Court held that OSHA may not enforce or implement its ETS. More recently, in October 2022, the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge from 10 states seeking to appeal a ruling affirming the CMS mandate.
These quickly evolving (and at times, conflicting) regulatory requirements and court decisions will likely create legal and operational challenges for health care providers, including our tenants that are hospitals, surgery centers, and certain physician practices, and may exacerbate existing challenges around staffing, leading to increased costs for temporary or contract labor and potential business disruptions, any of which may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to pay us rent.
