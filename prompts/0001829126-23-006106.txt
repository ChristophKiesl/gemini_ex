Corporate History
 
We were incorporated as Momentous Holdings Corp. on May 29, 2015 in the State of Nevada for the purpose of designing, acquiring and developing mobile apps and mobile software for download by end consumers.
 
On December 31, 2018, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Andrew Eddy (“Owner”), an individual residing in Great Britain and owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital shares of V Beverages Limited. (“V Beverages”), a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). V Beverages in turn owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital shares of MaxChater Ltd. (“MaxChater”), a company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom, which it acquired on August 1, 2018.
 
Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital shares of V Beverages (the “Target Shares”). Upon the closing of the transactions under the Share Exchange Agreement, the Owner transferred the Target Shares to the Company in exchange for 15,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001.
 
Following the acquisition of V Beverages, we ceased operations of developing mobile apps, the original business of the Company.
 
The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby V Beverages is considered to be the accounting acquirer and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger” or a “reverse acquisition,” the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger were and will be replaced with the historical financial statements of V Beverages prior to the reverse merger and in all future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
MaxChater was viewed as the predecessor entity for financial reporting purposes, and Momentous Holdings Corp. was viewed as the successor entity.
