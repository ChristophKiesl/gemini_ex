 Overview 
         We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics based on our proprietary Safely Metabolized And Rationally Targeted, or SMART, linker drug discovery platform. Our SMART linker drug discovery platform enables us to engineer product candidates that can simultaneously modulate multiple targets in a disease. Our proprietary product candidates impact pathways that are central to diseases where efficacy may be optimized by a multiple target approach. We have applied our SMART linker drug discovery platform to build an internal pipeline of product candidates for rare diseases, our primary focus, and plan to pursue partnerships to develop additional product candidates. 
         Our lead product candidate is edasalonexent, formerly known as CAT-1004, an oral small molecule. Based on its mechanism of action, the inhibition of NF-kB, or nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, we believe edasalonexent has the potential to be a disease-modifying therapy for all patients affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, regardless of the underlying dystrophin mutation. DMD is an ultimately fatal genetic disorder involving progressive muscle degeneration. The United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted orphan drug, fast track and rare pediatric disease designations to edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. The European Commission, or EC, has granted orphan medicinal product designation to edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. 
         We are currently conducting the MoveDMDÂ® Phase 1/2 trial of edasalonexent in ambulatory boys with DMD between ages four and seven. The MoveDMD trial is a three-part clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of edasalonexent in DMD. We previously reported positive safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biomarker results from Part A of the MoveDMD trial. We reported top-line Part B results in January 2017, indicating that the primary efficacy endpoint of average change from baseline to week 12 in the magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, T2 composite measure of lower leg muscles for the pooled edasalonexent treatment groups compared to placebo was not met. There were, however, consistent numerical improvements versus placebo across all functional exploratory endpoint measures for the higher dose, as well as numerical improvement versus placebo across multiple functional exploratory endpoint measures for the lower dose, while the lower dose had mixed results versus the higher dose. Changes in these functional measures were not statistically significant in Part B of the MoveDMD trial, which was not powered for functional measures. We believe that the potential treatment-associated effects from these exploratory endpoints warrant further evaluation in Part C of the MoveDMD trial, which is the ongoing open-label extension portion of the trial. We intend to transition all patients participating in Part C of the trial to the 100 mg/kg/day dose, the higher of the two dosing levels administered in Part B, and extending Part C by an additional 24 weeks, subject to institutional review board approval. We intend to report the results from Part C in 2017. We anticipate providing an interim update on Part C of the MoveDMD trial in the second quarter of 2017. In addition to our work in DMD, we are evaluating other diseases where the inhibition of NF-kB may be beneficial for further therapeutic applications of edasalonexent. There are a number of other rare diseases where NF-kB is believed to play an important role, such as Becker muscular dystrophy, which is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy and is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis, and IgA nephropathy, a kidney disease that is believed to result from activation of mucosal immunity leading to the synthesis of aberrantly glycosylated polymeric immunoglobulin A1, or IgA1, which enters the circulation and lodges in a patient's kidneys interfering with their proper function. 
         In addition to edasalonexent, we are developing a pipeline of product candidates using our SMART linker drug discovery platform as potential treatments for rare diseases including cystic 
 1

   fibrosis, or CF, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and Friedreich's ataxia, or FA. Our pipeline includes CAT-5571 and CAT-4001, for which we are currently conducting preclinical activities. We are developing CAT-5571 initially as a potential oral treatment for CF, with potential beneficial effects on both trafficking and function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, and the clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In CF, a malfunctioning CFTR ion channel impairs chloride secretion, with deleterious effects on multiple organs, and particularly devastating effects on pulmonary, intestinal and pancreatic function. Patients affected with CF are also predisposed to respiratory failure caused by persistent lung infections, notably bacteria and most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that are difficult to treat with standard antibiotics. CAT-5571 is a small molecule that activates autophagy, a process that maintains cellular homeostasis and host defense mechanisms, which are known to be impaired in CF. In addition, we are developing CAT-4001 as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as FA and ALS, irrespective of mutation status. FA is a rare genetic disease that causes nervous system damage and compromises motor coordination. ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease or classical motor neuron disease, is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurological disease that attacks the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. CAT-4001 is a small molecule that activates Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, or Nrf2, and inhibits NF-kB, two pathways that have been implicated in FA and ALS. 
         We have previously applied our SMART linker drug discovery platform to engineer our CAT-2000 series product candidates to inhibit the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein, or SREBP, pathway. Inhibitors of SREBP have been proposed for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, based on the role of SREBP in lipid metabolism and known human polymorphisms associated with NASH disease progression. NASH is characterized by the build-up of fat in the liver and chronic inflammation, which can trigger progression to fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis and sometimes hepatocellular carcinoma. We have advanced two CAT-2000 molecules, CAT-2003 and CAT-2054, into clinical development and intend to pursue a partnership for further development of the CAT-2000 series in NASH, which, in addition to CAT-2003 and CAT-2054, includes other discovery-stage molecules with intermediate rates of hydrolysis. 
         As of December 31, 2016, we owned five issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims directed to edasalonexent, four issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims directed to the CAT-2000 series, two issued U.S. patents with composition of matter claims generically covering CAT-5571 and two issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims directed to CAT-4001. These patents are expected to expire between 2029 and 2031, without taking into account potential patent term extensions. In addition, our patent portfolio includes over 50 issued foreign patents, over 10 pending U.S. patent applications and over 35 pending foreign patent applications. 
   Our Scientific Approach 
         Our SMART linker drug discovery platform enables us to engineer product candidates that can simultaneously modulate multiple biological targets in a disease. Our proprietary product candidates impact pathways that are central to diseases where efficacy may be optimized by a multiple target approach. 
         Multi-target therapies have in many cases been developed to provide treatment options where single-target therapies have been ineffective. These multi-target therapies have traditionally followed one of two approaches: either use of a single drug that binds to multiple biological targets or co-administration of two or more drugs that interact with different targets. While each of these approaches has well-established benefits in a variety of indications, each is also characterized by significant limitations. For example, use of a single broadly targeted drug can lead to off-target toxicities, side-effects and tolerability issues, and co-administration of two or more drugs can be confounded by differences in the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of the drugs, thereby 
 2

   reducing the likelihood of each agent being simultaneously active in the same cell. Our SMART linker drug discovery platform is designed to address these issues. 
         Our aim is to leverage the growing body of knowledge associated with disease pathways, and to rationally design orally bioavailable product candidates that simultaneously interact with multiple biological targets in a disease. While other technologies exist to conjugate or combine two bioactives, we believe that our SMART linker drug discovery platform provides substantial improvements over previous approaches to bioactive conjugation. 
   SMART Linker Drug Discovery Platform 
         We have leveraged our SMART linker drug discovery platform to engineer molecules that can simultaneously modulate multiple biological targets in a disease. Our drug discovery platform includes a broad array of linkers that we use to engineer molecular series. The linkers used in our drug discovery platform are small chemicals designed to join two separate bioactives into a single conjugate molecule, and some linkers are also bioactives. In systemic circulation, our SMART linker conjugates are typically stable and inactive, potentially reducing off-target toxicities and side-effects. Certain of our conjugates are designed to be cleaved by specific enzymes exclusively within cells in order to release the two bioactives inside the cells. By releasing the bioactive components of the conjugate molecule inside cells, the SMART linker allows the bioactives to reach their targets more efficiently and have greater efficacy than if the bioactives were dosed independently or in combination. 
         To create a conjugate using our SMART linker drug discovery platform, we begin by analyzing pathways that are disrupted in a disease. We then select two bioactive molecules known for their clinical safety and demonstrated effect along one or more of these biological pathways. We then design a SMART linker that will conjugate the two selected bioactives, allow the conjugate molecule to be carried to biological tissues and, following entry into cells, be cleaved by enzymes resident in the cells to release the bioactives. 
         We have SMART linker conjugates that are designed to be stable with oral dosing, as well as stable in both the lumen of the intestine and in systemic circulation, which we have now observed in clinical trials for two product candidate series. We can design the SMART linker to chemically link the two bioactive molecules through their pharmacophores, the regions of the bioactive molecules that are responsible for carrying out their biological activity, resulting in inactivation of the bioactives while conjugated. Once the conjugate enters a cell, the SMART linker may be cleaved by specific enzymes which reside only within cells, releasing the two bioactives to interact with their biological targets. Simultaneous delivery of the bioactives through the SMART linker conjugate into the cell results in the two bioactives having the same pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. As a result, our SMART linker conjugates can simultaneously modulate two biological targets in diseases of interest within the same cell. In addition, release of the bioactives inside cells can potentially reduce or eliminate off-target, extracellular activity of the bioactives, which may improve safety and tolerability. 
         We have observed in multiple preclinical studies that our SMART linker conjugates achieved greater efficacy than administration of the two bioactives either independently or in combination. In clinical trials, SMART linker conjugates have demonstrated significant improvements in activity on disease pathways and tolerability relative to equivalent doses of the two bioactives delivered in combination. We also have observed statistically significant pharmacological effects with SMART linker conjugates at dose levels significantly lower than the prescribed doses of the two component bioactives, as further described below under "ÂOur Product CandidatesÂEdasalonexentÂEdasalonexent Clinical DevelopmentÂCompleted Clinical Trials". We are developing a pipeline of preclinical assets using our SMART linker drug discovery platform to potentially treat rare diseases including CF, ALS, FA, and others.

           We believe that our SMART linker drug discovery platform has the potential to:
 

Â enhance activity on diseases through modulation of multiple biological targets; 
Â improve efficacy by matching the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of the component bioactives; and 
Â improve safety and tolerability by releasing the component bioactives within cells. 

 Our Product Candidates 
         The following chart summarizes key information regarding our product candidates. We hold rights to all of our product candidates throughout the world. 
 
  Edasalonexent 
         Edasalonexent is a SMART linker conjugate of salicylic acid and the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, a naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties. We designed edasalonexent to inhibit NF-kB, a protein that is activated in DMD and that drives inflammation, fibrosis and muscle degeneration, and suppresses muscle regeneration. We reported results from Part A of the MoveDMD trial in January 2016 and reported top-line safety and efficacy results for Part B of the trial in January 2017. Results from both Part A and Part B of the MoveDMD trial are described further below under "ÂEdasalonexent Clinical Development". In July 2016, we initiated an open-label extension, Part C of the MoveDMD trial, which is expected to provide safety and efficacy data on edasalonexent when administered for up to 48 weeks. The FDA has granted edasalonexent orphan drug, fast track and rare pediatric disease designations for the treatment of DMD. The EC has granted orphan medicinal product designation to edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. 
         In September 2016, we announced a pre-clinical joint research collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., or Sarepta, a commercial stage developer of RNA targeted therapeutics, established to explore a combination drug treatment approach for DMD. In the Catabasis and Sarepta 
 4

   collaboration, increased dystrophin protein expression was seen with an exon-skip modality in combination with edasalonexent in the designated mouse model of DMD. 
   Overview of DMD 
         DMD is a rare pediatric disorder involving progressive muscle degeneration that eventually leads to death. DMD is caused by various mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in a lack of functional dystrophin in muscle fibers, which renders muscle fibers more susceptible to mechanical stress. Dystrophin is a protein that resides in the membrane of muscle cells and is critical to the structural and membrane stability of muscle fibers in skeletal, including diaphragm, and cardiac muscle. When muscles contract or stretch during normal use, the absence of normally functioning dystrophin results in activation of the NF-kB pathway, triggering inflammation in the muscles, resulting in muscle damage and reducing the ability of muscles to regenerate. As muscle damage progresses, connective and adipose tissues replace muscle fibers, resulting in inexorable muscle weakness. 
         DMD occurs almost exclusively in males, occurring in approximately 1 in 3,500 live male births. Based on this incidence rate, we estimate that DMD affects a total of approximately 15,000 patients in the United States and approximately 19,000 patients in the European Union. 
         Children with DMD typically begin to show symptoms of disease between ages two and five, when they develop a waddling gait, frequently fall and have difficulty rising from the floor. Progressive weakness then develops in the voluntary muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. This muscle weakness is accompanied by fixations, or contractures, of joints, such as knees, hips and elbows. By age eight, most patients have difficulty ascending stairs. Patients typically lose walking ability between the ages of ten and fourteen and, by about twelve years of age, most people with DMD are unable to walk and need to use a power wheelchair on a regular basis. Patients' cardiac and respiratory muscles are also adversely affected, typically requiring use of ventilators in their late teens. Progressive weakening of cardiac and respiratory muscles of DMD patients eventually results in death, generally in their mid-twenties. 
   The Role of NF-kB in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
         NF-kB plays an important role in regulating skeletal muscle health and appears to be especially important in regulating skeletal muscle mass in chronic diseases such as DMD. Activated NF-kB promotes the degradation of specific muscle proteins and leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNF-a, interleukin 6, or IL-6, and interleukin-1 beta, or IL-1b; chemokines; cell adhesion molecules; and tissue degrading enzymes, such as matrix metallopeptidase 9, or MMP-9. In addition, activated NF-kB suppresses muscle stem cell differentiation that is required for muscle regeneration by preventing satellite stem cells from differentiating into myoblasts, progenitor cells that differentiate, to give rise to muscle cells. Activation of NF-kB is observed in muscle tissues of patients with DMD prior to the onset of other clinical manifestations, and activated NF-kB is persistently elevated in the immune cells and degenerating muscle fibers of patients with DMD. Moreover, evidence exists that mechanical stress activates NF-kB in muscles and increases levels of activated NF-kB by a factor of three to four times and drives NF-kB mediated inflammation. Muscles with increased mechanical stress and inflammation, such as quadriceps and hamstrings, show the greatest progression of disease. 
 Unaddressed Market Opportunity 
         There are currently only two therapies approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD: Sarepta's drug Exondys 51, also known as eteplirsen, an exon skipping therapy targeting the skipping of exon 51, that was granted accelerated approval by the FDA, and Marathon Pharmaceuticals' EMFLAZAÂ, also known as deflazacort, a corticosteroid, which is indicated for the treatment of DMD 
 5

   in patients five years of age and older. Corticosteroid therapy, including treatment with prednisone, is often prescribed to treat the inflammation underlying DMD and to delay loss of ambulation. Corticosteroids have demonstrated efficacy in DMD patients, which is believed to be driven by reductions in activated NF-kB. However, corticosteroids primarily act through another pathway called the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathway, and also can cause significant complications including growth suppression, excessive weight gain, behavioral changes, reduction in bone strength and compromise of the immune system. Over time, corticosteroids induce chronic myopathy in many diseases through induction of muscle protein breakdown, which ultimately leads to muscle damage. DMD patients treated with corticosteroids typically show an initial improvement in measures of muscle function but then resume a progressive decline. Approximately half of DMD patients treated with steroids lose the ability to walk by age thirteen and the vast majority are in wheelchairs by age sixteen. DMD patients typically live until their mid-twenties, despite the availability of corticosteroids. 
         Additionally, there are several treatments for DMD that are approved or under review in the European Union or are expected to be under review by regulatory agencies in the near future. Santhera Pharmaceuticals, or Santhera, has filed a marketing authorization application with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for RaxoneÂ®, also known as idebenone, for the treatment of DMD in patients with respiratory function decline and not taking concomitant glucocorticoids. Sarepta's Exondys 51 is under review by the EMA, and PTC Therapeutics' ataluren is conditionally approved in the European Union and several other countries for treatment of nonsense mutation DMD under the trade name TranslarnaÂ. PTC Therapeutics also re-filed a new drug application, or NDA, with the FDA in March 2017. Exondys 51 and ataluren target mechanisms to increase levels of dystrophin in muscles. Each of these agents addresses a specific type of genetic mutation in order to produce a partially functional dystrophin protein. The therapeutic goal of these product candidates is to reduce disease severity and extend survival in those DMD patients who are candidates for therapy with these agents. Based on the prevalence of the specific mutations that Exondys 51 and ataluren are designed to address, they would be expected to be effective in an aggregate of approximately 26% of DMD patients. We believe that DMD patients, including those treated with these dystrophin therapies, will continue to require treatments to reduce muscle inflammation and degeneration and enhance muscle regeneration. 
   Edasalonexent for the Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
         Based on the mechanism of action by which edasalonexent suppresses NF-kB and the results that we have seen in preclinical models of DMD, we believe that edasalonexent has the potential to combine reduction of inflammation and muscle degeneration with positive effects on muscle regeneration, all of which may allow patients to retain muscle function longer. In addition, we believe that edasalonexent has the potential to be an effective therapy in all DMD patients, regardless of the underlying mutation, and to provide significant benefit to patients, both as monotherapy and when used in combination with other therapies, including dystrophin-targeted therapies and agents targeting utrophin. We intend to commercialize edasalonexent in North America ourselves and commercialize edasalonexent outside of North America either ourselves or with a collaborator. 
 Edasalonexent Clinical Development 
 


MoveDMD Phase 1/2 Trial of Edasalonexent in Patients with DMD 

         Our MoveDMD Phase 1/2 trial enrolled ambulatory boys between ages four and seven with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of DMD who were steroid naive or had not used steroids for at least six months prior to the trial. Boys enrolled in the trial are not limited to any specific dystrophin mutations. The MoveDMD trial is designed to be conducted in three sequential parts, Part A and Part B, both of which have been completed, and Part C, an open-label extension initiated in July 2016, which is on-going. 
 6

           In Part A of the MoveDMD trial, which was conducted at three sites in the United States, we assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of edasalonexent in 17 patients, following seven days of dosing, across three dosing levels: 33 mg/kg/day, taken in a single daily dose, 67 mg/kg/day, taken in two daily doses, and 100 mg/kg/day, taken in three daily doses. We also compared edasalonexent exposure levels to exposure levels achieved in previous edasalonexent clinical trials in adults where inhibition of NF-kB was observed. In January 2016, we reported that all three doses of edasalonexent tested were generally well tolerated with no safety signals observed. The majority of adverse events were mild, and the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, primarily diarrhea. There were no serious adverse events and no drug discontinuations. For the 67 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day dosing levels, pharmacokinetic results demonstrated edasalonexent plasma exposure levels consistent with those previously observed in adults at which inhibition of NF-kB was observed, and edasalonexent significantly reduced the expression of a set of genes that are controlled by NF-kB. We subsequently reported results with positive NF-kB biomarker data that supported NF-kB target engagement via statistically significant reduction in NF-kB controlled gene expression for the 67 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day dosing levels. These two dosing levels were advanced to Part B of the trial. 
         Thirty-one boys enrolled in Part B of the MoveDMD trial and all completed Part B of the trial. Both dose levels of edasalonexent evaluated were well tolerated with no safety signals observed. The majority of adverse events were mild in nature and the most common treatment-related adverse events were gastrointestinal, primarily mild diarrhea and vomiting. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, no drug discontinuations and no dose reductions. Edasalonexent plasma exposure in Part B of the MoveDMD trial was consistent with that observed in Part A. 
         In Part B of the MoveDMD trial, we assessed the effects of edasalonexent using MRI T2 as an early biomarker at 12 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Part B of the MoveDMD trial was conducted at five sites in the United States, and we believe that it was the first Phase 2 trial in DMD to use MRI as a primary endpoint. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows investigators to view muscle structure and composition and measure disease status in children with DMD. Changes in MRI measures, particularly fat fraction, have been correlated in natural history studies with longer-term changes in clinically meaningful measures of functional activity. We used MRI T2 as the primary endpoint to serve as an early biomarker for demonstrating a benefit on muscle composition that potentially would allow us to see an effect of edasalonexent at 12 weeks of treatment, as has been seen by others with corticosteroids. We announced in January 2017 that the primary efficacy endpoint of average change from baseline to week 12 in the MRI T2 composite measure of lower leg muscles for the pooled edasalonexent treatment groups compared to placebo was not met (0.37 milliseconds for the pooled edasalonexent treatment groups versus 0.47 milliseconds for placebo; a smaller increase in MRI T2 is believed to correlate with less muscle inflammation). Although we did not see a similar treatment effect as corticosteroids on the MRI T2 composite measure at 12 weeks, we observed potential treatment-associated functional effects at both dose levels of edasalonexent on the exploratory endpoints described below, as well as continued to observe acceptable safety, tolerability and plasma exposure data in Part B of the MoveDMD trial. Therefore, as planned, we are measuring the effects of edasalonexent on patients with DMD in the MoveDMD trial in Part C to see if signals strengthen in the longer-term data from the ongoing open-label extension. 
 7

          
        Exploratory endpoints also included the following functional tests in Parts B and C of the MoveDMD trial: timed function tests best suited for the age group of the trial subjects, including the 10-meter walk/run, 4-stair climb and time-to-stand tests; the North Star Ambulatory Assessment; assessments of muscle strength; and the Pediatrics Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, a parent-proxy measure of functional ability. The trial is not powered to detect statistically significant changes in any of the exploratory endpoints during Part B or Part C, and no significant changes were detected in these measures for those dosed with edasalonexent versus placebo at 12 weeks. Top-line results from Part B demonstrated that the edasalonexent 100 mg/kg/day treatment group, whose patients took 33mg/kg capsules three times a day, consistently showed numerical improvement versus placebo across all measures of the functional test exploratory endpoints, although the changes were not statistically significant. Similarly, the 67 mg/kg/day treatment group, whose patients took 33mg/kg capsules twice a day, consistently showed numerical improvement versus placebo across multiple measures of the functional test exploratory endpoints, although the changes were not statistically significant and were mixed compared to the 100 mg/kg/day treatment group. Compared to the placebo group, patients in the edasalonexent 100 mg/kg/day group had characteristics of more advanced disease at baseline. This was indicated by the age at onset, age at diagnosis and the baseline values for time to complete the 4-stair climb and time-to-stand. In addition, baseline assessments were performed at the beginning of Part A and Part B of the MoveDMD trial to compare changes in functional measures in this control period to those observed in Part B and Part C. There were twelve boys who participated in Part A and received active treatment in Part B, and the rate of decline in functional measures for these boys generally showed numerical improvement over the active treatment period compared to the control period. We believe that the top-line results from the functional exploratory endpoints and additional functional assessments warrant further evaluation as planned in Part C of the MoveDMD trial. We intend to transition all patients participating in Part C of the trial to the 100 mg/kg/day dose and extending Part C by an additional 24 weeks, subject to institutional review board approval, so that we have the opportunity to assess the higher dose in all of the boys in Part C and so that the boys that started the open-label extension since July last year are able to continue to receive edasalonexent treatment. We intend to report the results from Part C in 2017. We anticipate providing an interim update on Part C of the MoveDMD trial in the second quarter of 2017. 
         Following additional assessment of the effects in patients of edasalonexent in Part C of the MoveDMD trial, we will determine next steps for the edasalonexent program in DMD. 
 


Completed Clinical Trials 

         To date, we have studied edasalonexent in three completed Phase 1 clinical trials, in addition to Part A of the MoveDMD trial, which is described above. The design for each of these other clinical trials are discussed below. 
 8

   EdasalonexentÂCompleted Phase 1 Clinical Trials 

   
 | | | Subjects | 
Trial | Description | Duration Of Dosing | Total | | Treated with edasalonexent
CAT-1004-101 | Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of edasalonexent in healthy subjects | 1 day | | 52 | | 39
CAT-1004-102 | Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edasalonexent in adults with Type 2 diabetes | 14 days | | 44 | | 32
CAT-1004-103 | Single-blind biomarker trial in healthy adults to compare activity of edasalonexent, a combination of salicylate and DHA, or placebo on activated NF-kB | 1 day | | 9 | | 8 


 Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose Trial (CAT-1004-101):    We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial in 52 healthy volunteers at a single site in the United States to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of edasalonexent in both fasted and fed states. The participants were randomized to receive edasalonexent or placebo. Edasalonexent was administered orally in soft gelatin capsules at doses ranging from 300 mg to 6000 mg. 
         Single doses of edasalonexent, administered to subjects in both fed and fasted conditions, appeared to be well tolerated. Subjects in the fasted state reported few adverse events, with the most commonly reported adverse events being headache, diarrhea and dizziness. Of the 44 subjects in the fasted state, five reported headache, three reported diarrhea and two reported dizziness. The majority of the adverse events in the fasted state were mild in severity. Of the 35 subjects in the fed state, six reported diarrhea, six reported headache and four reported abdominal pain. The most common adverse events in the fed state were diarrhea, headache and abdominal pain, and all of the adverse events in the fed state were mild in severity. Subjects in the fed state receiving single doses of edasalonexent of 4000 mg or more reported gastrointestinal adverse events more frequently than subjects receiving lower doses. No treatment-related severe adverse events were reported. There were no observed trends in laboratory, vital signs or electrocardiogram results following edasalonexent administration in either the fasted or fed state. 
         Edasalonexent was rapidly absorbed in plasma, with mean maximum and overall plasma exposure generally increasing with edasalonexent dose levels. Neither component bioactive, salicylate or DHA, was detected in plasma at levels above background, consistent with intracellular cleavage of edasalonexent and intracellular delivery of the component bioactives. Administration of a high-fat meal increased edasalonexent mean maximum and overall exposure by approximately three- to eight-fold. 
         Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose Trial (CAT-1004-102):    We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial in 44 subjects at a single center in the United States to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edasalonexent. These subjects had Type 2 diabetes and mild background inflammation, which enabled us to assess the activity of edasalonexent on activated NF-kB. Subjects were randomized to receive 
 9

   edasalonexent or placebo. edasalonexent was administered orally in soft gelatin capsules at total daily doses ranging from 300 mg to 4000 mg. 
         Edasalonexent administered for two weeks appeared to be well tolerated. The adverse events reported in more than one subject were each reported by two subjects. These adverse events were diarrhea (both instances reported by subjects receiving 4000 mg daily doses of edasalonexent), gastroenteritis (one instance reported by a subject in the placebo group and the other by a subject receiving 1000 mg daily doses of edasalonexent) and upper respiratory tract infection (both instances reported by subjects receiving 4000 mg daily doses of edasalonexent). The majority of the adverse events were mild in severity. No treatment-related severe adverse events were reported. 
         Edasalonexent was rapidly absorbed in plasma, with mean maximum and overall plasma exposure generally increasing with escalating single or multiple doses of edasalonexent. Neither component bioactive, salicylate or DHA, was detected in plasma at levels above background, again consistent with intracellular cleavage of edasalonexent and intracellular delivery of the component bioactives. 
         In the Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial, we observed by two methods that edasalonexent inhibited activated NF-kB. For the first method, we stimulated NF-kB activity ex vivo in whole blood from subjects treated with edasalonexent or placebo, and then observed NF-kB activity in monocytes, or immune cells, that we isolated from the whole blood. NF-kB activity was reduced in a majority of subjects following two weeks of edasalonexent treatment but not following treatment with placebo. For the second method, we performed gene expression analyses on whole blood taken from subjects prior to treatment and after two weeks of treatment with edasalonexent or placebo. Edasalonexent significantly reduced the expression of a set of genes that are controlled by NF-kB. In contrast, treatment with placebo for two weeks did not significantly reduce expression of NF-kB regulated genes. 
         Phase 1 NF-kB Biomarker Trial (CAT-1004-103):    We conducted a single-blind, crossover Phase 1 clinical trial with edasalonexent in nine healthy adult volunteers at a single center in the United States to compare activity of a single dose of 2000 mg of edasalonexent on activated NF-kB to a combination of salicylate and DHA or placebo. No adverse events were reported in this clinical trial. The salicylate and DHA were dosed at approximately equivalent amounts to those contained in the edasalonexent conjugate. We assessed NF-kB activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, isolated from subjects before dosing and two hours after dosing. PBMCs are circulating immune cells that can mount an NF-kB response and migrate into tissue such as muscle and drive inflammation. Prior to the determination of NF-kB activity, we stimulated whole blood with lipopolysaccharide, or LPS, to activate the NF-kB pathway. Treatment of subjects with edasalonexent significantly reduced the level of activated NF-kB, as measured by nuclear p65, a surrogate marker for activated NF-kB. In contrast, no change in the level of activated NF-kB was observed upon treatment with the combination of salicylate and DHA, or upon treatment with placebo. In this trial, edasalonexent, which is a SMART linker conjugate of salicylate and DHA, exhibited greater activity on the NF-kB pathway than the combination of its component bioactives. 
   Edasalonexent Preclinical Development 
         In preclinical studies, we have observed that edasalonexent inhibited NF-kB activity  in vitro and in vivo, and produced disease-modifying effects in two established animal models of DMD, the mdx mouse model and the Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy, or GRMD, dog model. 



In Vivo Studies in Animal Models of DMD 

         We have created several SMART linker conjugates that inhibit activated NF-kB. Two of these conjugates, edasalonexent and CAT-1041, exhibit very similar effects on NF-kB activity in cell based assays, in animal studies and on functional activity in animal models. CAT-1041 is a closely related analog of edasalonexent in which the DHA component of the salicylate-DHA conjugate has been 
 10

   replaced with the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA. In some preclinical studies, we used CAT-1041 as a surrogate for edasalonexent. Both edasalonexent and CAT-1041 produced disease-modifying efficacy in established animal models of DMD. We decided to advance edasalonexent into clinical trials rather than CAT-1041 based on scientific literature suggesting that DHA has superior anti-inflammatory activity compared to EPA. 
         mdx Mouse Model.    We examined the potential therapeutic effects of edasalonexent using the mdx mouse model of DMD. We observed that four weeks of treatment with edasalonexent or prednisolone, a steroid, reduced muscle inflammation and the number of degenerating muscle fibers in  mdx mice. However, only edasalonexent-treated animals showed preservation of muscle mass and an increase in the number of regenerating fibers, suggesting that chronic treatment with edasalonexent can protect muscle from the damage expected to occur over time in mdx mice. 
         In a long-term mdx mouse study, we observed that, compared to the control group of mdx mice, six months of treatment with CAT-1041 significantly improved muscle endurance as measured by mean weekly and total running distance determined based upon cumulative revolutions on a running wheel. Improvements in muscle endurance following CAT-1041 treatment versus control were also observed in post-mortem assessments of twitch force, tetanic force and specific force generation, each of which is an established measurement of muscle endurance, in excised diaphragm muscle. 
         We also observed in this same study that mdx mice treated with CAT-1041 showed significantly increased mass of two major leg muscles, the gastrocnemius and quadriceps. These increases were independent of changes in total body weight. CAT-1041 treated mice also had a statistically significant reduction in cardiac mass and fibrosis, suggesting that chronic treatment with CAT-1041 may have reduced the dilated cardiomyopathy typically observed in mdx mice. 
         In this study, we also observed that edasalonexent and CAT-1041 exhibited similar activity on muscle contractions of the extensor digitorum longus muscle in  mdx mice with significant preservation of muscle function compared to control. Finally, in this study we observed a reduction in diaphragm and quadricep muscle fibrosis in mdx mice treated with CAT-1041 in comparison to control. 
         Golden Retriever Dog Model.    We also evaluated the effects of edasalonexent in the GRMD dog model. A single oral dose of edasalonexent inhibited basal, or unstimulated, NF-kB activity by 48% in GRMD dogs. Edasalonexent also inhibited LPS-stimulated NF-kB activity by 75% and LPS-stimulated plasma levels of TNFa protein, a key marker of inflammatory response, by 77%. Together, these data suggest that a single oral dose of edasalonexent achieves sufficient exposure levels to inhibit activated NF-kB in a dog model of DMD. 
 


In Vitro Studies 

         In an in vitro study in a mouse macrophage cell line, we observed that edasalonexent inhibited LPS-stimulated NF-kB activity to a greater extent than either of its components, salicylate and DHA, alone or in combination. We also observed that edasalonexent inhibited LPS-stimulated NF-kB activity in human PBMCs, which are a potential target tissue for edasalonexent. In studies performed with a mouse macrophage cell line, edasalonexent reduced the LPS-stimulated expression of a set of genes that encode pro-inflammatory mediators and whose expression is controlled by NF-kB. 
   Edasalonexent Orphan Drug, Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations 
         The FDA has granted edasalonexent orphan drug, fast track and rare pediatric disease designations for the treatment of DMD. A product may be designated by the FDA as an "orphan drug" if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the FDA will not approve another sponsor's marketing 
 11

   application for the same product for the same use or indication before the expiration of seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. The FDA fast track process is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Companies that receive fast track designation are allowed to submit NDAs on a rolling basis, expediting the FDA review process, and benefiting from more frequent communication with the FDA to discuss all aspects of clinical development. In addition, drugs that receive fast track designation are eligible for accelerated approval and priority review if certain criteria are met. The FDA's rare pediatric disease designation gives us the potential to receive a priority review voucher if edasalonexent is approved. However, the rare pediatric disease program is set to expire in September 2020. 
         The EC has granted orphan medicinal product designation to edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. Similar to the FDA orphan drug designation, the EC may designate a product as an orphan medicinal product if it is intended for the treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons. In Europe, marketing authorization for an orphan medicinal product generally leads to up to a ten-year period of market exclusivity if the product candidate is granted marketing authorization in the European Union. 
   CAT-5571 
         CAT-5571 is a SMART linker conjugate that contains cysteamine, a naturally occurring molecule that is a degradation product of the amino acid cysteine, and DHA. We are developing CAT-5571 initially as a potential oral treatment for CF with potential effects on both the CFTR and on the clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CAT-5571 is a small molecule that activates autophagy, a process that maintains cellular homeostasis and host defense mechanisms, which are known to be impaired in CF. 
         We have shown in preclinical studies that CAT-5571 synergistically activates autophagy in cultured primary human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from patients with CF. In addition, we have shown in ex vivo preclinical studies that CAT-5571, in combination with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, a combination drug that consists of lumacaftor, which increases CFTR proteins that are trafficked to the cell surface, and ivacaftor, which increases the activity of the CFTR protein at the surface of epithelial cell, enhances cell-surface trafficking and function of CFTR with the F508del mutation, which is the most frequent CFTR mutation and is present in 86% of patients included in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation United States Patient Registry. We have also shown that CAT-5571 enhances the clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in preclinical models of CF, irrespective of CFTR mutation status. We are conducting additional preclinical activities with CAT-5571. 
         In 2017, we plan to continue preclinical evaluation of CAT-5571 in animal models of CF, and to conduct investigational new drug, or IND, application-enabling activities for CAT-5571. If we are successful in these activities, we intend to advance CAT-5571 into a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2018. 
   Cystic Fibrosis 
         Cystic fibrosis is a rare, chronic, genetic, life-shortening orphan disease that affects over 70,000 patients worldwide, predominantly in the Caucasian population. In CF, a malfunctioning CFTR ion channel impairs chloride secretion, with deleterious effects on multiple organs, and particularly devastating effects on pulmonary, intestinal and pancreatic function. Patients affected with CF are also predisposed to respiratory failure caused by persistent lung infections, notably bacteria and most commonly  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that are difficult to treat with standard antibiotics. CF patients have frequent pulmonary exacerbations due to their inability to clear the persistent lung infections. Advancement in research and treatments have extended the life expectancy for those living with CF, however, there is currently no cure.

     CAT-4001 
         CAT-4001 is a SMART linker conjugate that we designed to combine the potentially beneficial activities of monomethyl fumarate and DHA on the Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways. CAT-4001 is a small molecule designed to activate the Nrf2 pathway and inhibit the NF-kB pathway. We are developing CAT-4001 initially for the treatment of severe, rare neurodegenerative diseases, such as FA and ALS, two diseases of the central nervous system in which the Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways have been implicated, irrespective of mutation status. Nrf2 is a gene transcription factor, a protein that works inside of cells to control the expression of genes, that control the body's response to cellular stress and oxidative damage. We are conducting preclinical activities with CAT-4001. 
         We have shown that CAT-4001 modulates the Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways in both cellular assays and animal models. In these studies, we have also observed that the activity produced by CAT-4001 was greater than that produced by the individual bioactives, monomethyl fumarate and DHA, either alone or in combination at approximately equivalent amounts to those contained in the CAT-4001 conjugate. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are believed to play a central role in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including FA and ALS. In addition, monomethyl fumarate is the circulating form of the active ingredient of Biogen's Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), an FDA-approved treatment for multiple sclerosis, another neurodegenerative disease. We believe that this known therapeutic effectiveness of monomethyl fumarate offers further support for the potential for CAT-4001 to be developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. 
         Based on its mechanism of action, we believe that CAT-4001 has the potential to be a disease modifying agent in certain neurodegenerative diseases. In 2017, we plan to continue preclinical evaluation of CAT-4001 in animal models of FA as well as ALS. 
   Friedreich's Ataxia 
         Friedreich's ataxia is a rare genetic disease that causes nervous system damage and compromises motor coordination. FA is caused by a defect in the frataxin gene, which regulates iron levels in the mitochondria. In the majority of cases, the genetic defect in FA causes a reduction in the production of the frataxin protein and iron levels in mitochondria become poorly regulated. In FA, iron overload in mitochondria affects metabolism, causing oxidative stress and ultimately damaging mitochondrial DNA. Progressive degeneration of central and peripheral nervous systems in FA patients causes impaired gait and coordination, muscle loss and fatigue. Disease progression varies, but generally, the patient is confined to a wheelchair within 10 to 20 years after the appearance of the first symptoms. Patients may become completely incapacitated in later stages of the disease. 
         FA occurs in both males and females and is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 individuals. Based on this prevalence rate, we believe there are up to 6,000 patients with FA in the US and up to 15,000 FA patients in the European Union. 
         The Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance announced in January 2016 that we were the recipient of the Kyle Bryant Translational Research Award. The Kyle Bryant Translational Research Award specifically focuses on pre-clinical and clinical investigations that target treatments for FA. 
   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
         ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease or classical motor neuron disease, is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurological disease that attacks the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. Eventually, muscle weakness and atrophy occur. People with ALS lose the ability to stand and walk, and use their hands and arms. In later stages of the disease, individuals have difficulty breathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. Although ventilation support can enable breathing and 
 13

   prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within three to five years of diagnosis. 
         According to the ALS Association, approximately 5,600 people in the United States are diagnosed with ALS each year. The incidence of ALS is two per 100,000 people, and it is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans may have the disease at any given time. ALS occurs throughout the world and affects all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups. 
   CAT-2000 Series 
         Our CAT-2000 compounds are SMART linker conjugates of nicotinic acid and EPA. The linkers for our CAT-2000 series compounds are cleaved through intracellular enzymatic hydrolysis, to release the component bioactives to inhibit SREBP. By using different linkers, we have produced product candidates within the CAT-2000 series that possess different hydrolysis rates, resulting in distinct pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and pharmacology. We have been able to demonstrate enzymatic hydrolysis and inhibition of SREBP in  in vitro studies with CAT-2000 molecules. In addition, in vivo, CAT-2000 molecules have demonstrated efficacy in multiple preclinical models of hyperlipidemias and NASH. We believe that our portfolio of CAT-2000 molecules, which includes the clinical-stage molecules CAT-2003 and CAT-2054 and other discovery-stage molecules with intermediate rates of hydrolysis, provides an opportunity to develop a therapy for NASH. We intend to pursue a partnership for further development of the CAT-2000 series in NASH. 
 Sales and Marketing 
         Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any collaboration or co-promotion arrangements. If we are able to progress our edasalonexent program, we intend to commercialize edasalonexent in North America ourselves and commercialize edasalonexent outside of North America either ourselves or with a collaborator. In addition, we intend to expand the drug development applications of our SMART linker drug discovery platform through selective collaborations with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
         Each of our SMART linker conjugate product candidates is a small molecule compound manufactured from component raw materials. The omega-3 fatty acid materials that we use as bioactives are purified from natural sources by established pharmaceutical fine chemicals manufacturers. The other bioactive and linker raw materials that we use are also readily available from established pharmaceutical intermediate manufacturers. The components are conjugated to form the SMART linker product candidate using well understood, conventional chemistries. 
         We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce both drug substance and drug product required for our clinical trials. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaborators to manufacture commercial quantities of our products, if approved. 
   Competition 
         The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. If we successfully develop and commercialize any of our product candidates, we and any future collaborators will face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of the entities developing and marketing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. 
 14

          
        The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
   Edasalonexent for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
         There are currently only two therapies approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD. Sarepta's drug Exondys 51, also known as eteplirsen, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD under the accelerated approval pathway in September 2016 for patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. In addition, in February 2017, Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC announced that the FDA granted approval of EMFLAZAÂ, also known as deflazacort, a corticosteroid, for the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older. Outside of the United States, PTC Therapeutics' drug ataluren, also known as TranslarnaÂ, has been conditionally approved within the European Union Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Israel and South Korea for the treatment of nonsense mutation DMD. Although not previously approved for the treatment of DMD, corticosteroid therapy, including prednisone, is considered standard of care and is often prescribed to treat the inflammation underlying DMD and to delay loss of ambulation. 
         A number of companies are developing therapies to treat DMD in patients with specific mutations in the dystrophin gene. In addition to eteplirsen, Sarepta has two additional exon-skipping therapies for DMD in Phase 3 clinical development. These agents, SRP-4053 and SRP-4045, target skipping of exons 53 and 45, respectively. Daiichi-Sankyo is developing an exon-skipping product candidate for DMD patients with out-of-frame deletion mutations amenable to exon 45 skipping, and announced in February 2016 that it began its first Phase 1/2 clinical trial for its product candidate, DS-5141b, in Japan. NS Pharma has a compound, NS-065/NCNP-01, in Phase 2 clinical development in the United States and Japan for patients with mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping. Based on the prevalence of the specific mutations that these product candidates being developed by Sarepta, Daiichi-Sankyo and NS-Pharma are designed to address, they would be expected to have the potential to be effective in an aggregate of approximately 16% of DMD patients. In addition to these clinical stage programs, BioMarin has announced its intent to continue to explore the development of next generation oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD, and Wave Life Sciences is developing an exon 51 skipping candidate, WVE-210201, for which it has announced plans to enter the clinic in the second half of 2017. 
         In addition to exon-skipping therapies, other companies have alternative therapeutic approaches to the treatment of DMD in late stage clinical development. Santhera announced in September 2016 that it enrolled its first patient in its Phase 3 trial (SIDEROS) that will assess the efficacy of its drug RaxoneÂ®, also known as idebenone, in slowing the rate of respiratory function decline in DMD patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoids. Santhera has stated that successful completion of the SIDEROS trial will provide the necessary data to support an NDA filing with FDA for Raxone. Santhera has filed a marketing authorization application with the EMA for Raxone for the treatment of DMD in patients with respiratory function decline and not taking concomitant glucocorticoids. PTC Therapeutics' ataluren provides another alternative therapeutic approach to treating DMD, already approved outside of the United States as mentioned above. Ataluren is designed to enable the formation of a functioning dystrophin protein in patients with DMD caused by a nonsense mutation. In February 2016, PTC Therapeutics received a Refuse to File letter for ataluren from the FDA and appealed this decision, and this appeal was subsequently denied by the FDA in October 2016. PTC Therapeutics filed a new ataluren NDA for nonsense mutation DMD over protest with the FDA in March 2017. A number of companies also have products candidates in clinical development for DMD, including Akashi Therapeutics, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Capricor Therapeutics, Cardero Therapeutics, Italfarmaco SpA, Pfizer, Phrixus Pharmaceuticals, Reveragen, Summit Plc and Taiho Pharmaceuticals. If successfully 
 15

   developed, some of these alternative therapeutic approaches may be applicable to all DMD patients regardless of underlying mutation status. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including certain aspects of our SMART linker drug discovery platform. 
         Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. 
         The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
         As of December 31, 2016, our patent estate included over 20 issued U.S. patents, over 50 issued foreign patents, over 10 pending U.S. patent applications and over 35 pending foreign patent applications. 
         With regard to edasalonexent, we have five issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims directed to edasalonexent and its use. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2029, without taking a potential patent term extension into account. In addition, we have patents that have been granted in various countries including Australia, China, Europe, Japan, Mexico and New Zealand, which are expected to expire in 2029, without taking potential patent term extensions into account, and at least five pending patent applications in various other countries and regions in North America, South America, and Asia, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2029, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. 
         With regard to CAT-5571, we have two granted U.S. patents with composition of matter claims generically covering CAT-5571, which are scheduled to expire in 2030, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. We also have a pending international patent application with claims covering CAT-5571 and related compounds and their use, including their use in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
         With regard to CAT-4001, we have two granted U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims directed to CAT-4001 and its use. These U.S. patent are scheduled to expire in 2031, without taking a potential patent term extension into account. In addition, we have patents that have been granted in various countries including Australia, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and Taiwan, which are expected to expire in 2031, without taking potential patent term extensions into account, and at least 5 pending patent applications in various other countries and regions in North 
 16

   America, South America, Europe and Asia, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2031, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. 
         With regard to CAT-2003 and CAT-2054, we have four issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims directed to CAT-2003 and CAT-2054 and their use. These U.S. patents are scheduled to expire in 2030 and 2031, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. In addition, we have patents that have been granted in several different countries including Australia, Mexico, China, Japan and New Zealand, which are expected to expire in 2030, without taking potential patent term extensions into account and at least 20 pending applications in various other countries and regions including North and South America, Europe, and Asia, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2030, without taking patent term extensions into account. In addition, we have a pending U.S. patent application covering CAT-2054, which, if issued, is expected to expire in 2033, without taking a potential patent term extension into account. We have at least 10 counterpart patent applications pending in various countries and regions in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2033, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. 
         The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
         In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering edasalonexent, CAT-5571, CAT-4001, CAT-2003 and CAT-2054 may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our product candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved product candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
         In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including, for example, certain aspects of our manufacturing processes and conjugate selection methodologies. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. 
   Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
         Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent 
 17

   compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
   Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
         In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. 
         An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

Â completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's good laboratory practice, or
GLP, regulations; 
Â submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
Â approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
Â performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety
and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
Â preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
Â review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
Â satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof,
are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's
identity, strength, quality and purity; 
Â satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
Â payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 
Â compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies
required by the FDA. 

 Preclinical Studies 
         Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term 
 18

   preclinical testing, such as chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity assessments, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
         Companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the candidate product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the candidate product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
   The IND and IRB Processes 
         An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
         Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
         A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with FDA certain regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA's regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, 
 19

   as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
         In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
         Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
         Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
   Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
         Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

Â Phase 1.  The drug is initially
introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism,
distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 
Â Phase 2.  The drug is administered
to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage
tolerance and optimal dosage. 
Â Phase 3.  The drug is administered
to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and
safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
Â Phase 4.  Post-approval studies,
which are conducted following initial approval, are typically conducted to gain additional experience and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

 20

          
        Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or  in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
         Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
   Submission of an NDA to the FDA 
         Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2017 is $2,038,100. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, which for fiscal year 2017 are $97,750 per product and $512,200 per establishment. 
         The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA's receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for "priority review" products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
         Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required 
 21

   specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites involved with the conduct of the Phase 3 clinical trials to assure compliance with GCP. If compliance or data integrity is called into question due to inspection finding, this may cause a delay or affect the likelihood of drug approval. 
         In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
         The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
   Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
         The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. 
         Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product's application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
         Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and 
 22

   approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
         Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA's goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
         Finally, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
   Accelerated Approval Pathway 
         The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
         For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. There is limited experience with accelerated approvals by the FDA based on intermediate clinical endpoints. However, the FDA has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
         The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the 
 23

   duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
         The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor's agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug's clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
   The FDA's Decision on an NDA 
         On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA, and other foreign regulatory agencies, have substantial discretion in the approval process. 
         If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug's safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
   Post-Approval Requirements 
         Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
         In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon 
 24

   the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
         Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

Â restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
Â fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
Â refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
Â product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
Â injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

         The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
         In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
   Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
         In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
         Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is "bioequivalent" to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug..." 
         Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD in its publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," also referred to as the "Orange Book." Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic 
 25

   equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA's designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
         Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
         The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
   Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
         Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
         Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

Â the required patent information has not been filed; 
Â the listed patent has expired; 
Â the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
Â the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

         A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 
 26

           If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
   Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
         Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA's internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
         The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
         Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
   Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
         Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an "orphan drug" if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 27

           If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to our product or due to an inability to assure a sufficient quantity of the orphan drug. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
   Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
         A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program 
         With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in the law. This provision is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a "rare pediatric disease" may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. 
         For the purposes of this program, a "rare pediatric disease" is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare disease or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. A sponsor may choose to request rare pediatric disease designation, but the designation process is entirely voluntary; requesting designation is not a prerequisite to requesting or receiving a priority review voucher. In addition, sponsors who choose not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a priority review voucher if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. Under the Cures Act, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized until 2020. However, if a drug is designated before October 1, 2020, it is eligible to receive a voucher if approved before October 2022.

     The 21st Century Cures Act 
         On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the Cures Act into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases. 
         With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of "real world evidence" to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new "limited population" approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a "regenerative advanced therapy," thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations. 
   Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
         In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
   Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
         Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
         To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing 
 29

   authorization by the EC that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
         Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
         The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state's assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
         If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
   Clinical Trial Approval 
         Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union, including GCP, are set forth in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the European Union member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each European Union member state in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a Clinical Trial Application is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country. 
 30

          
        In April 2014, the European Union passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the new European Union clinical trials legislation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all European Union member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable. According to the current plans of the EMA, the new Clinical Trials Regulation will become applicable in October 2018. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system. 
         The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the European Union portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states; a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned. Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned; strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications; and the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
   Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 
         In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
         In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 31

     Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
         Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the EC or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
   Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
         Regulation 141/2000 provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Community when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Community would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Community or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
         Regulation 847/2000 sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the European Union. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of "clinically relevant superiority" by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 shall be eligible for incentives made available by the European Community and by the member states to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs. 
   Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
         On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, which is commonly referred to as "Brexit". The withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the U.K. provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the European Union Treaty. The U.K. Prime Minister has stated that notice of withdrawal will be given by the end of March 2017. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, 
 32

   Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K. 
   Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
         Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
         In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 
         The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. 
         Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
         In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
 33

     Healthcare Law and Regulation 
         Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:


Â the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering,
receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or
service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
Â the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit
individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false
statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
Â the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among
other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
Â HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also
imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
Â the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making
any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
Â the federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education
Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services
information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and
Â analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or
services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

         Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
   Healthcare Reform 
         A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of 
 34

   pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
         In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. The Affordable Care Act:
 

Â expanded manufacturers' rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic
drugs and revising the definition of "average manufacturer price," or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
Â addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are
inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
Â expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; and 
Â established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the
negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 

         Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
         With the new Presidential Administration and Congress, there will likely be additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Resolution is not a law, however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. 
         The President and Congressional leaders have expressed interest in repealing certain Affordable Care Act provisions and replacing them with alternatives that may be less costly and provide state Medicaid programs and private health plans more flexibility. It is possible that these repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits. The scope of potential future legislation to repeal and replace Affordable Care Act provisions is highly uncertain in many respects, and it is possible that some of the Affordable Care Act provisions that generally are not favorable for the research-based pharmaceutical industry could also be repealed along with 
 35

   Affordable Care Act coverage expansion provisions. However, at this time the coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act appear most likely to be repealed and replaced.
