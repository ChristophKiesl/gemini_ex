The global manufacturing plants consist of the one domestic location in Athol, Massachusetts (1880) and the international operations located in Itu, Brazil (1956), and Suzhou, China (1997). The Company consolidated Jedburgh; Scotland and Mt. Airy, NC saw manufacturing operations into Brazil in fiscal year 2021. This strategic restructuring continues to improve manufacturing utilization and creates a global scale saw business. All subsidiaries principally serve the global manufacturing industrial base with concentration in the metalworking, construction, machinery, equipment, aerospace and automotive markets.
The Company offers its broad array of measuring and cutting products to the market through multiple channels of distribution throughout the world. The Company’s products include precision tools, electronic gages, gage blocks, optical, vision, laser measuring equipment, custom engineered granite solutions, tape measures, levels, chalk products, squares, band saw blades, hole saws, hacksaw blades, jig saw blades, reciprocating saw blades, M1® lubricant and precision ground flat stock. The Company primarily distributes its precision hand tools, saw and construction products through distributors or resellers both domestically and internationally.

Skilled personnel, superior products, manufacturing expertise, innovation and unmatched service has earned the Company its reputation as the “Best in Class” provider of measuring application solutions for industry.
Notwithstanding the pandemic the Company introduced approximately 200 new Electronic Precision Measuring Tools and a new Wireless Data collection instruments this fiscal year. This investment was to support the Company’s strategic intent to provide measurement applications compatible with Industry 4.0. This major upgrade to ninety-five percent of the electronic micrometer offerings provided new features such as water & dust resistance, larger LCD displays, longer battery life, more tactile button feel, ergonomic frame design for comfort of use and wireless connectivity. This investments converted popular legacy mechanical measuring tools to electronic digital displays that broadened Starrett’s Industry 4.0 measuring tool portfolio. 
In addition, The Company introduced DataSure 4.0 Wireless Data Collecting System. This system is used to collect and transmit measured data for production and quality control areas.

The Company’s saw and hand tool product lines enjoy strong global brand recognition and market share. These products encompass a breadth of uses. The Company introduced several new products in the recent past including a new line of hand tools for measuring, marking and layout that include tapes, levels, chalk lines and other products for the building trades. The Company also introduced new products to its hand tool portfolio to extend its reach into the construction and retail trades. The continued focus on high performance, production band saw applications has resulted in the development of two new ADVANZ carbide tipped products MC5 and MC7 ideal for cutting ferrous materials (MC7) and non-ferrous metals and castings (MC5). These actions are aimed at positioning the Company for global growth in wide band products for production applications.
Over the last few years, the Company has launched new products, such as abrasive cut-off wheels and butcher knives, in order to become more product diverse and to invest in new distribution channels and industries such as the food industry. The Company was able to move into this channel with, in addition to meat and fish cutting blades, a variety of products such as butter knives, skinner and slicer blades, bandsaw machines and related products. The Company has also invested in new channels taking its traditional products such as Bi-metal bandsaws and its Power Tool Accessories product lines into welding and e-Commerce channels.
Personnel
At June 30, 2021, the Company had 1,436 employees, with approximately 50% in North America and 50% in International operations. This represents a net decrease from June 30, 2020 of 49 employees, consistent with the restructuring plan.  The headcount change included an decrease of 11 in North American operations and a decrease of 38 internationally.
The Company's Brazilian operation has a form of collective bargaining among the workers trade union and the manufacturers association that is organized in Brazil by industrial sectors. Brazil has approximately 300 direct labor and another 100 in selling, general and administration. In general, the Company considers relations with its employees to be excellent. Domestic employees hold shares of Company stock resulting from various stock purchase plans and employee stock ownership plans. The Company believes that this dual role of owner-employee has strengthened employee morale over the years.
Competition
The Company competes on the basis of its reputation as the best in class for quality, precision and innovation combined with its commitment to customer service and strong customer relationships. To that end, Starrett is increasingly focusing on providing customer centric solutions. Although the Company is generally operating in highly competitive markets, the Company’s competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by specific market since none of its competitors offer all of the same product lines offered by the Company or serve all of the markets served by the Company.
The Company is one of the largest producers of mechanics’ hand measuring tools and precision instruments. In the United States, there are three major foreign competitors and numerous small companies in the field. As a result, the industry is highly competitive. During fiscal 2021, there were no material changes in the Company’s competitive position. The Company’s products for the building trades, such as tape measures and levels, are under constant margin pressure due to a channel shift to large national home and hardware retailers. The Company has responded to such challenges by expanding its manufacturing operations in China. Certain large customers also offer their own private labels “own brand” that compete with Starrett branded products. These products are often sourced directly from low cost countries.
Saw products encounter competition from several domestic and international sources. The Company’s competitive position varies by market and country. Continued research and development, new patented products and processes, strategic acquisitions and investments and strong customer support have enabled the Company to compete successfully in both general and performance applications.
Foreign Operations
The operations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are consolidated in its financial statements. The subsidiaries located in Brazil and China are actively engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of precision measuring tools, saw blades, optical and vision measuring equipment and hand tools. Subsidiaries in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and Singapore are engaged in distribution of the Company’s products. The Company expects its foreign subsidiaries to continue to play a significant role in its overall operations. A summary of the Company’s foreign operations is contained in Note 17 “Financial Information by Segment & Geographic Area” to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Strategic Activities

The Company’s strategic concentration is to continue building a global brand and providing unique customer value propositions through technically supported application solutions for our customers.
