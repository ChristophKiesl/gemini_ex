The terms the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the combined enterprises of Genesis Financial, Inc. (“Genesis Financial”), Epoint Payment Corp. (“Epoint”) , Fintech Holdings, LLC and Fintech Investments, Inc. after giving effect to the Exchange Agreement and the related transactions described below, except with respect to information for periods before the consummation of the Exchange Agreement which refer expressly to Epoint or Genesis Financial, as specifically indicated.
 
Reverse Merger with EPOINT Payment Corp.
 
On February 15, 2018, Genesis Financial and Epoint completed the transactions contemplated by the previously disclosed Capital Stock Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) entered into as of September 8, 2017, as subsequently amended. Under the Exchange Agreement, Genesis acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Epoint, following which Epoint became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Genesis. The transaction was structured as a tax-free reorganization and exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Genesis issued to Epoint’s shareholders an aggregate of 8,231,536 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of their capital holdings in Epoint. At the closing, Genesis also issued to Epoint’s shareholders warrants to purchase up to an additional 845,000 shares of common stock in exchange for an equal number of Epoint common stock warrants. The warrants are exercisable through February 12, 2028 at a per share exercise price of $3.00.
 
On February 12, 2018, Epoint issued warrants to purchase 1,970,250 shares of common stock to certain partners, associates, and designees of Whitestone Investment Network, Inc., a mergers and acquisition advisory group which was instrumental in introducing the management of Epoint to Genesis, and in structuring the Exchange Agreement. At the closing of the Exchange Agreement on February 15, 2018, Genesis also issued to these entities warrants to purchase up to 1,970,250 shares of its common stock in exchange for an equal number of Epoint common stock warrants. The warrants are exercisable through February 12, 2023 at a per share exercise price of $3.00.
 
At the closing of the Exchange Agreement on February 15, 2018, noteholders of $250,000 in principal amount of convertible loans payable (described in Note 5) voluntarily elected to convert their loans into 100,000 shares of Genesis common stock at a conversion rate of $2.50 per share.
 
Prior to the closing, Genesis was engaged in the business of buying and selling seller financed real estate loans and originating commercial real estate loans and providing start-up funding (the “Prior Business”). In connection with the closings and as mandated by the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Genesis and the Coghlan Family Corporation (the “Coghlan Family Corporation”), an entity controlled by John R. Coghlan, one of the directors and the holder of the majority of the outstanding debt of Genesis prior to the closing, entered into an agreement with Genesis pursuant to which the Coghlan Family Corporation agreed, at a mutually agreeable date after the closings, to assume and otherwise discharge all of Genesis’ outstanding debt, except for a loan of $100,000 payable to Coghlan Family Corporation (the “CFC Loan”), in consideration of the transfer to it by Genesis of the assets related to the Prior Business (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”). The CFC Loan bears interest at an annual rate of 6% and the maturity date was extended to May 15, 2019. Upon extension of the note in May 2018, Genesis issued to Coghlan Family Corporation 65,000 shares of Common Stock.
 
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification section 805, “Business Combinations”, Genesis has accounted for the Exchange Agreement transaction as a reverse business combination using the acquisition method. This determination is based on Epoint shareholders obtaining voting control as well as management and Board control of the combined entity. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in these consolidated financial statements are those of Epoint and are recorded at the historical cost basis of Epoint, and the assets and liabilities of Genesis at the merger date were recorded at their fair values.

For accounting purposes, Genesis is deemed to have issued 879,765 common shares to the legacy shareholders of Genesis. Using an estimated fair value of common stock on February 15, 2018 of $2.00 per share, the purchase price of the 879,765 shares held by the legacy shareholders of Genesis was approximately $1,759,500. The difference between the fair value of these shares and the recorded fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Genesis totaling $1,835,684 was allocated to Goodwill. The preliminary fair value estimates for the consideration paid and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for our acquisition is based on preliminary calculations and valuations and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change as we obtain additional information for our estimates during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that were not yet finalized related to valuation of goodwill and fair value of common stock.
 
Acquisition of Fintech – Immediately following the closing of the Exchange Agreement, on February 15, 2018, Genesis and Fintech Holdings, LLC (“Fintech LLC”), an Oregon limited liability company, signed and closed a Membership Interest Exchange Agreement between Genesis and Fintech LLC (the “Fintech Exchange Agreement”; together with the Exchange Agreement, the “Exchange Agreements”) pursuant to which Genesis issued to the members of Fintech LLC an aggregate of 26,435,604 shares of Common Stock. Fintech Investments Inc., the wholly-owned subsidiary of Fintech LLC (“Fintech Investments”) and a company formerly owned and operated by Gary Larkin, the former Executive Co-Chairman of Genesis, holds the intellectual property licenses of Epoint’s proprietary platform technologies. Given that the entities were under common control, all of the transactions performed by Fintech Investments were done at the direction of Epoint, and substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets, management determined that the assets acquired do not represent a business. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of Fintech LLC and Fintech Investments have been recorded at their historical cost basis at the merger date, and are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
Henceforth, all references to the “Company” shall mean and include Genesis Financial., Inc. and its subsidiaries, following the closing of the Exchange Agreements.

Overview of the Business of the Company
 
Genesis Financial, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Epoint Payment Corp., is engaged in providing a range of diverse alternate financial products designed for cost-efficient delivery via a smart phone or other mobile device. Epoint intends to initiate financial services with an integrated “Mobile First” enabled program targeting underbanked and unbanked consumers, initially in North America, which will include micro credit, mobile phone device financing programs, money transfers, prepaid debit cards, bill payments, mobile top up, check processing, insurance and travel.
 
We intend to leverage our relationships and agreements with key technology and media participants, together with appropriate financial institutions and distribution partners, to offer target customers a wide range of price leading and more convenient local and international financial services, including money transfer, bill payment, mobile top up, Point of Sale (POS) payments, instant micro loans, check processing, insurance and travel services, all of which are to be delivered via an advanced proprietary platform technology.
 
We plan to initiate our service offering with products designed to appeal to key underbanked consumer market segments including ex-patriate Spanish speaking consumers in the United States.
 
The Epoint value proposition has been achieved through strong collaboration with leading players from within the existing payment and mobile telephony industries which leverages the existing infrastructure in a manner not previously achieved, to create cost efficiencies and expanded functionality designed specifically to cater to the Epoint customers.
 
Prior to the closing, Genesis was engaged in the business of buying and selling seller financed real estate loans and originating commercial real estate loans and providing start-up funding. Following the closing of the reverse acquisition between Genesis Financial, Inc. and Epoint Payment Corp., pursuant to which Epoint became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Genesis, these operations have been discontinued.
 
Industry Background
 
For most people, having a bank account is as natural as breathing. But according to the 2016 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, 15.6 million adults are completely unbanked and 27% of U.S. households, or approximately 68 million consumers, are underbanked, which means they have no credit history or only nonbank credit. These unbanked and underbanked consumers tend to rely solely upon alternate financial services or in many instances are forced supplement their bank relationship with alternative financial services. In both categories, consumers often turn to non-bank financial products that many consumer advocates describe as predatory at worst and insufficient at best.
 
In addition to those consumers who have traditionally fallen into the under-banked and unbanked category, there is an emerging segment of consumers, including millennials, who are drawn to less formal banking preferring to manage their finances through prepaid debit cards and/or more recently reloadable mobile wallets. As merchants have moved to replace legacy credit/debit card processing terminals with more secure Micro Chip (EMV Chip), Near Field Communication (NFC) and Biometric capable devices we have seen emergence of more mobile device payment services (i.e. Apple Pay, Bank of America mobile wallet programs). We expect a substantial growth in mobile wallet managed purchases leading to reductions and or possible elimination of the traditional physical card over the coming years.
 
According to the Nielsen’s fifth report on the Latino consumer in the annual Diverse Intelligence Series, Hispanic power and influence is surging: 50% of U.S. population growth from 2010 to 2015 has come from Hispanics, and the U.S. Census expects the U.S. Latino population to more than double within the next two generations. Almost 57 million strong, Hispanics represent almost 18% of the U.S. population, and they’re expected to continue showing growth, reaching 24% of the population by 2040. To put this in perspective, the report notes, “if U.S. Hispanics were a standalone country, their market buying power would be one of the top twenty economies in the world.” Based on these projections the unbanked Hispanic consumer controls annual spending of over $300 billion.
 
We believe a unique window of opportunity exists to establish a “Lifestyle Brand” for the under-banked consumer, initially with the Hispanic market segment in the U.S. Existing financial services providers (e.g., Amex, Visa, MasterCard, Capital One, Discover, MoneyGram, Western Union and almost all US Banks) are not generally regarded as positive lifestyle brands to the Hispanic consumer.
 
Epoint leverages several key distinctions:
 

● | Our target customer already uses prepaid cards and alternate financial services, just not typically through a single channel or brand; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our target customer is highly mobile connected and relies heavily on their mobile phone to maintain contact with their loved ones.

A substantial segment of our target consumer base relies heavily on remittances from the Hispanic population in the United States to Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. A remittance is a transfer of money by a foreign worker to an individual in his or her home country. According to a World Bank report released October 3, 2017 remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean in 2017 were expected have risen by 6.9 percent to $79 billion. The World Bank also predicts that remittances to the region will likely continue to grow, to approximately $82 billion in 2018. 
 
The Epoint Solution
 
The Epoint solutions technology ecosystem incorporates a range of discrete and proprietary platforms interfaced with industry leading third parties which deliver either core network, gateway payment or third-party product solutions. The key elements of our proprietary solutions include the following:
Epoint eWallet Platform Technology 
 
Epoint has developed a proprietary platform for the delivery of mobile App enabled financial solutions. This secure, regulatory compliant and fully scalable platform has been developed and is supported by a permanent IT staff of experienced developers. Our team possesses substantial domain expertise within the banking, payments and remittance segments of the global financial services industry.
 
The eWallet platform meets all existing regulatory requirements for Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance. In addition to PCI compliance, Epoint has integrated advanced data security protocols to further protect its clients and end-users from financial and personal information theft and fraud.
 
Our eWallet mobile solutions are designed to fulfil the regulatory requirements of the financial service industry including that of international remittance which must comply with stringent OFAC, FINCIN and Patriot Act requirements.
 
The Epoint Micro Credit or MLOC capability and Program Platform (the “MLOC Platform”) was sub-licensed to Epoint by Fintech Investments. The unique MLOC Platform has been designed to support a variety of market applications dependent upon the specific channel partner’s requirements. This flexibility enables the optimum reach into developing markets with minimal development or ramp-up time.
 
Epoint has been able to craft a unique, integrated suite of financial services products that can be offered to end consumers as an “IN-NETWORK” package. These initial integrated service offerings will include:
 

● | A secure debit card issued by participating regulated banks and differentiated by a range of bundled financial services, that provides the convenience of retail and online purchasing within the U.S. and Latin American markets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fast and cost efficient international Money Transfer at a consumer price point significantly less than currently available options. 
● | In-market and cross-border bill payment solutions (Pay by phone, mobile or Internet for less than half of current market cost). 
● | Domestic & cross-border Remote mobile top up (conveniently reload prepaid mobile minutes anywhere anytime) 
● | A complete mobile financial services solution for the under-banked. Easy download and complete remote financial services transaction management for everyone 
● | Cash in/cash out services at thousands of convenient retail locations 
● | Remote check cashing via mobile phone (No more standing in lines and paying high fees to cash checks) 
● | Domestic and cross border rewards and loyalty programs 
● | Emergency credit facilities. 

Product Offerings
 
Epoint will offer a comprehensive and fully integrated set of cost efficient mobile enabled financial services targeted to the under-banked and unbanked consumer, including:
 

● | Debit Cards & eWallets: Delivering a combination of both traditional general purpose reloadable debit cards and network integrated mobile phone wallets, will enable the Epoint customer to take full advantage of their purchasing power at all participating retailers, ATMs and online merchants. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Money Transfer: Low cost and ultra-convenient way for consumers to send money anywhere anytime using the convenient fully compliant mobile remittance application. Offering lower cost money transfer with the convenience of mobile payment saves our customers many lost hours of time spent in lines at traditional retail remittance locations.

● | Bill Payment: Epoint mobile enabled bill payment services will provide consumers with a convenient and cost-efficient way to pay recurring and one-off household bills. Instead of standing in lines at retail counters to purchase money order for rent or utility payments, Epoint empowered consumers can take care of their monthly household utility and recurring bills utilizing their mobile communication devices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Check Cashing: Using a convenient online mobile remote check capture will allow our consumers to save both time and money converting payroll checks into cash or instant purchasing power. 
● | Mobile Top Up: The unbanked and under-banked consumer is predominately a prepaid mobile services customer, because achieving monthly account status is almost impossible without established credit and banked history. Epoint enables pay as you go customers to buy competitively priced wireless plans directly from their mobile phone, thereby reducing both cost and time. 
● | Loyalty & Rewards: Well-banked customers have come to expect competitive and valuable rewards and loyalty programs from their credit and debit card providers. These programs have matured over the last ten years and resulted in movement from one network card to another based solely on loyalty (i.e. American Express Costco Rewards, Airline mileage credit card programs etc.). The unbanked and under-banked customers have not been able to participate in these increasingly valuable consumer marketing activities. Through an Epoint enabled Loyalty & Rewards Plan, including cross-border loyalty/rewards programs, our future customers would be able to earn valuable benefits, discounts and preferred pricing based upon their purchase history. 
● | Insurance Services: Auto, home, death and disability insurance products are desirable and sought-after products in the under-banked communities. Epoint intends to present products which can be purchased through the Epoint Consumer Portal and paid for online with the Epoint debit card. 
● | Credit Services: Today’s unbanked and under-banked consumer typically looks to either a Pay Day lender or a Pawn Shop as a source for short-term credit, with medium and long-term credit options completely out of reach. Epoint intends to introduce a range of affordable credit options including: 


○ | Payroll based credit programs: These will be made available in the U.S following pending regulation for the re-introduction of products of this nature. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Credit Card Services: As a secondary phase expansion, Epoint intends to introduce a Credit Card for the sub-prime consumer. This is a strong market opportunity with many able partners ready to support a well-branded move into this market segment. 
○ | Cross Border Credit: Current credit regulation and policy in the U.S. excludes the sub-prime consumer. We plan to expand into Mexico and offer the Mexican consumer a small dollar value credit solution, or a micro loan, which will be linked to a recurring Mexico bound remittance from a U.S. based Epoint cardholder. 

Competitive Advantages of the Epoint Solution
 
We believe that Epoint has a disruptive competitive advantage which will be rooted in our unique and exclusive coupling of established payment networks and electronically automated processes which cannot easily, if at all, be replicated by existing market providers.
 
Existing financial services providers including banks, money transfer agents and alternate financial services bureaus have created expensive retail infrastructures to support their required physical interaction with a customer. These groups together with traditional debit/credit card networks including Visa, MasterCard and Discover are further hampered by embedded economic distribution models that were developed decades ago to protect once essential individual channel partners, which Epoint will efficiently circumvents with its streamlined processes. In the following bullet points we have briefly described the competitive infrastructure and compared it to the Epoint solution:
 

● | Debit/Credit Card Financial Services: The card networks have focused solely upon providing a backbone to enable the use of a card at the Point of Sales (“POS”). These transactions generate fees and interchange that create the vast majority of network revenues. These Network competitors have relied upon their pervasiveness within the banking industry to retain customers rather than expand their financial services offerings to assist the unbanked or under-banked by providing valuable network delivered and cost effective ancillary financial services. Their origins, as previously bank owned entities, have led to their deferral of all ancillary services to their bank partners. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | International Money Transfer/Remittance: The long-term leaders in the enormous remittance market including Western Union, MoneyGram and Travelex together with newcomers such as XOOM, rely heavily upon a physical transaction capture and/or distribution networks.

○ | This expensive and cumbersome retail presence has layered in historical costs that have continued to keep remittance charges higher than necessary, often exceeding 10% of the funds being sent, and rarely less than $4.99 per transaction. The Epoint “In-Network” remittance program leverages our network partner relationships with leading industry participant such as FIS for their reach throughout the U.S. and Latin America. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Epoint is able to utilize the low-cost cross-border Mexico debit network to profitably send money instantly and at unprecedented ultra-low costs that cannot be easily matched by any of the traditional remittance competition or newcomer Internet service providers. 
○ | Even the largest of US banks (Wells Fargo) which recently announced it would be introducing a new remittance service to its existing customers, projects a retail price of over $7 per transaction. 
○ | Cost of pre-existing infrastructure — inability to easily gain equivalent relationships with core financial network operators in the U.S and Mexico, together with existing high cost of established distribution structures are all ongoing impediments for our competitors within the remittance product segment. 


● | Cross Border Bill Payment & Mobile Top-Up: We believe the unmatched resources of Epoint, FIS and its partners within Mexico will provide the most efficient and cost effective cross-border bill payment and mobile money top-up between US and Mexico, ensuring we maintain both the “best of breed” customer solution and the lowest possible market price. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Significant Agreements and Arrangements
 
The provision of the Epoint solution requires the collaboration of various market participants with whom Epoint currently has agreements and others with whom it is in discussion with relating to various collaboration efforts. Below is a summary of these agreements and arrangements.

● | Epoint has a long-term Network operational services agreement with FIS, the world’s largest payment processing group. This agreement provides Epoint with turnkey acceptance of Epoint issued debit cards at over 2.0 million US retail locations and more than 450,000 ATMs. In addition, this network support enables our Bank and Program management partners to create mobile wallet and other virtual accounts. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Epoint has a master services agreement with FIS’s PayNet Group for the provision of all U.S. outbound remittance services. Under this agreement FIS will offer Epoint access at most favorable rates to all FIS global remittance distribution as well as its secure and compliant remittance transaction-processing services. 
● | A strategic teaming agreement with AMDOCS for Epoint to provide financial services to AMDOCS key customers. AMDOCS, a leader in provision of essential services to the world’s largest mobile carriers including AT&T/Crickett, Tracfone, Sprint, Airtel, Vodafone, America Movil, and Telefonica. 
● | Epoint has secured an agreement with StreetCred Capital, LLC, (StreetCred), a prominent provider of lead generation for finance within the mobile telephony industry. Under this agreement Epoint intends to develop and deliver a rent-to-own (“RTO”) mobile phone device financing program for certain StreetCred mobile carrier clients in the U.S. and Mexico. 
● | Epoint is working to enter into several agreements with US and Central American distribution and support partners to secure direct distribution rights for its diverse mobile financial services suite of products, of which no guarantee can be provided as to ultimate success. 

Market Penetration Strategy
 
Exploiting the Existing Distribution Channels
 
We intend to partner with leading prepaid issuing banks and their key program manager to position our financial products and our card /mobile wallet account services to the under-banked consumer. Epoint further plans to exploit strategic partnerships with prominent industry distribution channel partners including AMDOCS, StreetCred, leading carriers within the mobile segment, prominent program managers within the prepaid debit card segment, and others. We believe that the unique relationships Epoint has forged with FIS and its nationally operated payment network NYCE, will allow Epoint to in distribution within the U.S. market.
Card and Mobile Wallets
 
We intend to establish partnership agreements with both traditional debit card and emerging mobile wallet programs. Through these partnerships, our customers will be able to choose either traditional debit cards or where applicable their mobile wallet to efficiently complete purchase transactions. Well-established brand marketers generally manage these payment programs for sponsoring banks. We intend to enter into agreements with a number of major mobile carriers both directly and as part of the AMDOCS Teaming agreement. In addition, we are finalizing a regional Distribution and Services support agreement covering Central America with a leading credit services group based in Mexico.

Financial Institution Program Sponsors
 
We are in the process of finalizing agreements with several banks to support Epoint programs for initial launch within the U.S.
 
In addition, we intend to form additional partnerships with other prepaid sponsor banks which also have strong reach into the pre-paid debit card market.
 
Community banks and Credit Unions within the U.S. are struggling to capture and retain customers. The increased regulatory burdens imposed upon banks for basic consumer financial services including prepaid debit card issuance, remittance, bill payment and other daily financial services have exceeded the revenue potential of the programs. While the largest of the national banks can afford to support the internal compliance and operational overheads necessary to satisfy their regulators, smaller regional financial institutions have been crowded out losing any competitive edge.
 
The initial national acceptance of the Epoint card at all PIN Debit retail locations and ATMs provides our end user customers with the necessary coverage to conduct all daily purchase and cash back transactions.
 
Our Revenue Model
 
Epoint intends to deploy a channel partner lead “Business to Business to Consumer” (B2B2C) marketing distribution strategy designed to enable Epoint to reach its intended target customer base. This strategy has the distinct advantage of capturing consumers in large groups often with a common known socio-economic or ethnic make-up which allows for more precise message targeting for higher conversion rates.
 
While it is subject to change as our business develops, Epoint has devised a structured pricing model that provides shared revenue with the channel partners based on the conversion and revenue generated directly from their consumers. Each of Epoint’s financial services has a distinct economic yield and channel partners are able to adjust end-user costs basis to assist in driving higher aggregate program yields based on the unique characteristics of their own customers.
 
All the pricing and revenue share elements are configurable within the advanced Epoint platform and program results are published in real-time through the secure reporting portal so that our partners can track inter-daily program usage and performance. 
 
Competition
 
The payment and financial services industries are highly competitive, and our continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. Although we do not face direct competition from any competitor in exactly the same combined lines of business, we face competition from a variety of financial and non-financial business groups. These competitors include retail banks, non-traditional payment service providers, such as retailers and mobile network operators, traditional kiosk and terminal operators and electronic payment system operators, as well as other companies that provide various forms of payment services, including electronic payment and payment processing services. Competitors in our industry seek to differentiate themselves by features and functionalities such as speed, convenience, network size, accessibility, hours of operation, reliability and price. A significant number of our competitors have greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we have, operate robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers.
 
We expect to face varied competition across our anticipated full product service offerings including:
