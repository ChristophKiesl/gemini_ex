Item 1.     Business
General
 
We were formed as a Delaware corporation in 1997. We are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products. We perform a wide range of manufacturing, engineering, design and other technical services, often under sole-source contracts with corporations principally in the markets for truck components, oil and gas pipeline components and aerospace and defense electronics. 
 
We are organized into two business segments, Sypris Technologies and Sypris Electronics. Sypris Technologies, which is comprised of Sypris Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries, generates revenue primarily from the sale of goods and manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components and assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets. Sypris Electronics, which is comprised of Sypris Electronics, LLC, generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing and technical services as an outsourced service provider to customers in the market for aerospace and defense electronics. Additionally, prior to August 16, 2016, Sypris Electronics also provided trusted solutions for identity management, cryptographic key distribution and cyber analytics. See “Sypris Electronics Outlook” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and also Note 4 “CSS Sale” to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.
 
We focus on those markets where we believe we have the expertise, qualifications and leadership position to sustain a competitive advantage. We target our resources to support the needs of industry participants that embrace multi-year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management. These contracts, many of which are sole-source by part number, historically have created opportunities to invest in leading-edge processes or technologies to help our customers remain competitive. The productivity, flexibility and economies of scale that can result offer an important opportunity for differentiating ourselves from the competition when it comes to cost, quality, reliability and customer service.
 
Sypris Technologies. Through Sypris Technologies, we are a significant supplier of forged and machined components, serving the commercial vehicle, off highway vehicle, light truck and energy markets in North America. We have the capacity to produce drive train components including axle shafts, gear sets, steer axle forgings, and other components for ultimate use by the leading truck manufacturers, including Chrysler Group LLC (Chrysler), Ford Motor Company (Ford), General Motors Company (GM), Freightliner LLC (Freightliner), Mack Trucks, Inc. (Mack), Navistar International Corporation (Navistar), PACCAR, Inc. (PACCAR) and Volvo Truck Corporation (Volvo). We support our customers’ strategies to outsource non-core operations by supplying additional components and providing additional value added operations for drive train assemblies. 
 
As previously disclosed, the Company made several strategic decisions to migrate away from certain of its traditional Tier 1 customers in the commercial vehicle markets, while seeking to replace these customers with longer-term relationships, especially among the heavy truck, off-highway and automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”s) and others who place a higher value on the Company’s innovation, flexibility and core commitment to lean manufacturing principles. As a result of these decisions, the Company anticipates a significant reduction in its revenues in Sypris Technologies for 2017. This prompted the Company’s decision to partially shut down and to explore the exit or disposal of one of its largest commercial vehicle component manufacturing facilities (the “Broadway Plant”) in Louisville, Kentucky in an orderly fashion. In connection with this process, the Company and Meritor have determined not to renew their current supply agreement for certain of Meritor’s domestic, forged axle shafts, beginning in 2017, and the Company similarly anticipates a reduction in certain portions of its business with Eaton. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these portions of the Meritor and Eaton business represented approximately 18% and 4% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. However, the Company will continue to supply significant volumes of component parts to Sistemas Automotrices de Mexico, S.A de C.V. ("Sistemas''), Meritor’s joint venture in Mexico, and will continue to supply axle shafts to Meritor’s Brazilian subsidiary going forward, such continuing business accounts having represented approximately 13% of our net revenue in 2016.

We continue to adjust our overhead and infrastructure to be more in line with projected levels of customer demand and market requirements. We have developed plans to cut costs and rebuild our revenues over time in order to become profitable again. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. While we hope to take advantage of our excess capacity through our ongoing efforts, there can be no assurances that such conditions will continue or that our efforts to cut costs and rebuild our revenues through new customers will be successful. 
 
Our sales of engineered products such as pressurized closures, insulated joints and other specialty products, primarily to oil and gas pipelines and related energy markets have remained an independent source of diversified revenues and are becoming an area of greater focus for the Company going forward. We are committed to exploring new product developments and potential new markets, which will be an increasing area of focus for the Company going forward. 
 
Our net revenues from Sypris Technology decreased $44.8 million from $108.1 million in 2015 to $63.3 million in 2016. Despite this decline, Sypris Technologies still represented approximately 69% of our net revenues in 2016.
 
Sypris Electronics. Sypris Electronics generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing and technical services as an outsourced service provider to customers in the market for aerospace and defense electronics. Additionally, prior to August 16, 2016, Sypris Electronics also provided trusted solutions for identity management, cryptographic key distribution and cyber analytics and manufactured complex data storage systems. 
 
Our electronic manufacturing services (EMS) business is focused on circuit card and full box build manufacturing, high reliability manufacturing, integrated design and engineering services, systems assembly and integration, design for manufacturability, and design to specification work. Our customers include large aerospace and defense companies such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed Martin), Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop Grumman), Harris Corporation (Harris) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI).

The industry and business environment of Sypris Electronics is highly competitive and continues to be impacted by policy and budget decisions of the U.S. Government, as well as economic conditions. Future budget cuts, or future procurement decisions associated with the U.S. Government’s authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of Sypris Electronics’ existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows. Net revenue from Sypris Electronics decreased $8.7 million from $37.2 million to $28.5 million in 2016 compared to the prior year. Approximately $5.7 million of this decrease compared to the prior year is due to the mid-year sale of the CSS business in August 2016 which resulted in net revenue from the CSS business not being included in the results of Sypris Electronics for the remainder of 2016. Sypris Electronics accounted for approximately 31% of net revenue in 2016, up from 26% of our net revenue in 2015 primarily due to the decline in revenues in Sypris Technologies.
 
Our Markets
 
Sypris Technologies. The industrial manufacturing markets include truck components and assemblies and specialty closures. The truck components and assemblies market consists of the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, including Chrysler, Ford, Freightliner, GM, Mack, Navistar, PACCAR and Volvo, and an extensive supply chain of companies of all types and sizes that are classified into different levels or tiers. Tier 1 companies represent the primary suppliers to the OEMs and include Meritor, Dana, Detroit Diesel Corporation (Detroit Diesel), American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. (America Axle) and Eaton Corporation (Eaton), among others. Below this group of companies reside numerous suppliers that either supply the OEMs directly or supply the Tier I companies. In all segments of the truck components and assemblies, however, suppliers are under intense competitive pressure to improve product quality and to reduce capital expenditures, production costs and inventory levels. As noted above, the Company has determined to migrate away from certain of its traditional Tier 1 customers in the commercial vehicle markets, while seeking to replace these customers with longer-term relationships, especially among the heavy truck, off-highway and automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”s) and others who place a higher value on the Company’s innovation, flexibility and core commitment to lean manufacturing principles.

The specialty closures market consists primarily of oil and gas pipelines, which are also facing significant pressures to improve quality, reduce costs and defer capital expenditures. 
 
Sypris Electronics As noted above, the U.S. Government’s budget process and the ongoing spending reductions to defense programs has adversely impacted our portfolio of traditional business in this segment, which is dependent upon discretionary appropriations for defense programs. Although we believe that our programs are well aligned with national defense and other priorities, shifts in domestic and international spending and tax policy, changes in security, defense and intelligence priorities, the affordability of our products and services, changes in or preferences for new or different technologies, general economic conditions and other factors may affect the level of funding for existing or proposed programs. Uncertainty over budget plans and national security spending may prove challenging for our customers, as well as the defense industry as a whole. 
 
Market conditions for our EMS business are characterized by a number of obstacles. The nature of providing outsourced manufacturing services to the aerospace and defense electronics industry as well as other regulated markets differs substantially from the commercial electronics manufacturing industry. The cost of failure can be extremely high, the manufacturing requirements are typically complex and products are produced in relatively small quantities. Companies that provide these manufacturing services are required to maintain and adhere to a number of strict and comprehensive certifications, security clearances and traceability standards. As mentioned above, U.S. Government and private customer spending levels remain uncertain.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to improve our position in each of our core markets by increasing our number of multi-year contracts with customers and investing in highly innovative and efficient production capacity to remain competitive on a global scale. We intend to serve our customers and achieve this objective by continuing to:
 
Concentrate on our Core Markets. We are a significant supplier of forged and machined components, serving the commercial vehicle, off highway vehicle, light truck and energy markets in North America. We have been an established supplier of manufacturing and technical services to major aerospace and defense companies and agencies of the U.S. Government for over 40 years. We will continue to focus on those markets where we have the expertise and qualifications to achieve a competitive advantage.
 
Dedicate our Resources to Support Strategic Partnerships. We will continue to prioritize our resources to support the needs of industry leaders that embrace multi-year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management and have the potential for long-term growth. We prefer contracts that are sole-source by part number so we can work closely with the customer to the mutual benefit of both parties. 
 
Pursue the Strategic Acquisition of Assets. Over the long-term, we may consider the strategic acquisition of assets to consolidate our position in our core markets, expand our presence outside the U.S., create or strengthen our relationships with leading companies and expand our range of value-added services in return for multi-year supply agreements. We target assets that can be integrated with our core businesses and that can be used to support other customers, thereby improving asset utilization and achieving greater productivity, flexibility and economies of scale. 
 
Grow Through the Addition of New Value-Added Services. We hope to grow through the addition of new value-added manufacturing capabilities and the introduction of additional components in the supply chain that enable us to provide a more complete solution by improving quality and reducing product cost, inventory levels and cycle times for our customers. In many instances, we offer a variety of state-of-the-art machining capabilities to our customers in the industrial manufacturing markets that enable us to reduce labor and shipping costs and minimize cycle times for our customers over the long-term, providing us with additional growth opportunities in the future. Successfully migrating from design and manufacturing of complex circuit card assemblies to box builds would increase product content with our customers and would allow us to be a more significant outsourced manufacturer in the aerospace and defense supply chain.
 
We believe that the number and duration of our strategic relationships should grow to enable us to invest in our business with greater certainty and with less risk. The investments we make in support of these relationships are targeted to provide us with the productivity, flexibility, technological edge and economies of scale that we believe will help to differentiate us from the competition in the future when it comes to cost, quality, reliability and customer service.

Manufacturing Services

Our manufacturing services typically involve the fabrication or assembly of a product or subassembly according to specifications provided by our customers. We purchase raw materials or components from our customers or independent suppliers in connection with performing our manufacturing services. We strive to enhance our manufacturing capabilities by advanced quality and manufacturing techniques, lean manufacturing, just-in-time procurement and continuous flow manufacturing, six sigma, total quality management, stringent and real-time engineering change control routines and total cycle time reduction techniques.
 
Industrial Manufacturing Services. We offer our customers a wide range of capabilities, including automated forging, machining, induction hardening, heat-treating and testing services to meet their exacting requirements. We also design and fabricate production tooling, manufacture prototype products and provide other value-added services for our customers. Our manufacturing services contracts for the truck components and assemblies markets are often sole-source by part number. Part numbers may be specified for inclusion in a single model or a range of models. Where we are the sole-source provider by part number, we are generally the exclusive provider to our customer of those specific parts and for the duration of the manufacturing contract.
 
Electronics Manufacturing Services. We provide our customers with a broad variety of value added solutions, from low-volume prototype assembly to high-volume turnkey manufacturing. We employ a multi-disciplined engineering team that provides comprehensive manufacturing and engineering support to customers. The manufacturing solutions we offer include design conversion and enhancement, process and tooling development, materials procurement, system assembly, testing and final system configuration. Our manufacturing services contracts for the aerospace and defense electronics market are generally sole-source by part number. 
 
Products
 
In addition to our outsourced contract manufacturing services, we offer specialized products including light weight axle components and specialty closures and joints used in pipeline and chemical systems. As we look to grow our products business and seek to replace the revenues lost from the Dana and certain other, less strategic, product supply agreements, greater emphasis will be placed on the commercialization of new products to broaden our portfolio and meet the needs of our customers.

Our Customers
 
Our customers include large, established companies and agencies of the federal government. We provide some customers with a combination of outsourced services and products, while other customers may be in a single category of our service or product offerings. Our five largest customers in 2016 were Meritor, Sistemas, Detroit Diesel Corporation, Northrup Grumman and Eaton, which in the aggregate accounted for 53% of net revenue. Our five largest customers in 2015 were Meritor, Sistemas, Detroit Diesel Corporation, Northrup Grumman and Eaton, which in the aggregate accounted for 62% of net revenue. In 2016, Meritor, Sistemas and Detroit Diesel represented approximately 19%, 12% and 10% of our net revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue in 2016. In 2015, Meritor, Sistemas and Detroit Diesel represented approximately 30%, 11% and 10% of our net revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2015. In addition, U.S. governmental agencies accounted for 3% and 5% of net revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

As noted above, the Company and Meritor have determined not to renew their current supply agreement for certain of Meritor’s domestic, forged axle shafts, beginning in 2017, and the Company similarly anticipates a reduction in certain portions of its business with Eaton. For 2016, these portions of the Meritor and Eaton business represented approximately 18% and 4% of our net revenue, respectively. However, the Company will continue to supply significant volumes of component parts to Sistemas Automotrices de Mexico, S.A de C.V. ("Sistemas''), Meritor’s joint venture in Mexico, and will continue to supply axle shafts to Meritor’s Brazilian subsidiary going forward, such continuing business accounts having represented approximately 13% of our net revenue in 2016.

Geographic Areas and Currency Fluctuations
 
We are located in the U.S. and Mexico. Our Mexican subsidiaries and affiliates are a part of Sypris Technologies and manufacture and sell a number of products similar to those Sypris Technologies produces in the U.S. In addition to normal business risks, operations outside the U.S. may be subject to a greater risk of changing political, economic and social environments, changing governmental laws and regulations, currency revaluations and market fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have primarily impacted our earnings only to the extent of remeasurement gains or losses related to U.S. dollar denominated accounts of our foreign subsidiaries, because the vast majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, other income, net, included foreign currency transaction gains of $1.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively. 
 
Net revenues from Mexican operations, were $11.7 million, or 13%, and $8.9 million, or 6%, of our consolidated net revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, net income from our Mexican operations was $0.9 million, as compared to our consolidated net income of $6.0 million. In 2015, the net loss from our Mexican operations was $8.6 million, as compared to our consolidated net loss of $27.2 million. Revenues from our Mexican operations are expected to grow significantly as a percentage of our consolidated net revenues, especially in connection with the partial shutdown of the Broadway Plant, scheduled for mid-2017. You can find more information about our regional operating results, including our export sales, in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Sales and Business Development
 
Our principal sources of new business originate from the expansion of existing relationships, referrals and direct sales through senior management, direct sales personnel, domestic and international sales representatives, distributors and market specialists. We supplement these selling efforts with a variety of sales literature, advertising in trade media and participating in trade shows. We also utilize engineering specialists to facilitate the sales process by working with potential customers to reduce the cost of the service they need. Our specialists achieve this objective by working with the customer to improve their product’s design for ease of manufacturing or by reducing the amount of set-up time or material that may be required to produce the product. The award of contracts or programs can be a lengthy process, which in some circumstances can extend well beyond 24 months. Upon occasion, we commit resources to potential contracts or programs that we ultimately do not win.

Our objective is to increase the value of the services we provide to the customer on an annual basis beyond the contractual terms that may be contained in a supply agreement. To achieve this objective, we commit to the customer that we will continuously look for ways to reduce the cost, improve the quality, reduce the cycle time and improve the life span of the products and/or services we supply the customer. Our ability to deliver on this commitment over time is expected to have a significant impact on customer satisfaction, loyalty and follow-on business.
 
Since the beginning of 2015, we have signed long term supply agreements with Detroit Axle and Volvo. We have also been awarded purchase orders for various services and components from American Axle, Meritor, Sistemas, and Dana. We are launching the Sypris Ultra® axle shaft with Detroit Axle and have strong interest from others within the customer base who are interested in this patented product. We are continuing to explore other opportunities as they arise and have significant list of outstanding quotations in progress, but there can be no assurances that our efforts to develop new sources of revenues will adequately replace the loss of the Dana or other, less strategic, business. 

Competition
 
The markets that we serve are highly competitive, and we compete against numerous domestic companies in addition to the internal capabilities of some of our customers. In the truck components and assemblies market, we compete primarily against other component suppliers such as Ramkrishna Forgings Limited, Mid-West Forge, Inc., GNA Axles Limited, Brunner International, Inc., US Manufacturing Corporation, Commercial Forged Products, Spencer Forge and Machine, Inc. and Traxle, which serve as suppliers to many Tier I and smaller companies. In the aerospace and defense electronics market, we compete primarily against companies such as Celestica Inc., Jabil Circuit, Inc. and Spartan Corporation. We may face new competitors in the future as the outsourcing industry evolves and existing or start-up companies develop capabilities similar to ours. In addition, we will face new competitors as we attempt to increase and expand our business.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the availability of capacity, currency exchange rates (especially in low-cost countries), technological capability, flexibility, financial strength and timeliness in responding to design and schedule changes, price, quality and delivery. Although we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors, some of our competitors, as compared to us, are larger and have greater financial and operating resources, greater geographic breadth and range of services, customer bases and brand recognition than we do. We also face competition from manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers that continually evaluate the relative benefits of internal manufacturing compared to outsourcing. 
 
Suppliers
 
For significant portions of our business, we purchase raw materials and component parts from our customers or from suppliers chosen by our customers, at prices negotiated by our customers. When these suppliers increase their prices, cause delays in production schedules or fail to meet our customers’ quality standards, our customers have contractually agreed to reimburse us for the costs associated with such price increases and not to charge us for costs caused by such delays or quality issues. Accordingly, our risks are largely limited to accurate inspections of such materials, timely communications and the collection of such reimbursements or charges, along with any additional costs incurred by us due to delays in, interruptions of, or non-optimal scheduling of production schedules. However, for a growing part of our business, we arrange our own suppliers and assume the additional risks of price increases, quality concerns and production delays.
 
Raw steel and fabricated steel parts are a major component of our cost of sales and net revenue for the truck components and assemblies business. We purchase a portion of our steel for use in this business at the direction of our customers, with periodic changes in the price of steel being reflected in the prices we are paid for our services. Increases in the costs of steel or other supplies can increase our working capital requirements, scrap expenses and borrowing costs.
 
There can be no assurance that supply interruptions or price increases will not slow production, delay shipments to our customers or increase costs in the future, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Delays, interruptions or non-optimal scheduling of production related to interruptions in raw materials supplies can be expected to increase our costs.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development expenditures were mainly related to our product lines that served the aerospace and defense electronics market. With the sale of the CSS business in August 2016, we expect research and development costs to be minimal going forward. Process improvement expenditures related to our outsourced services are not reflected in research and development expense. Accordingly, our research and development expense represents a relatively small percentage of our net revenue. Company-sponsored research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We invested $0.3 million and $0.8 million in research and development in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We own or license a number of patents and trademarks, but our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one patent, trademark, license or technologically related group of patents or licenses.
 
We regard our manufacturing processes and certain designs as proprietary trade secrets and confidential information. We rely largely upon a combination of trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements with customers, suppliers and consultants, and our internal security systems, confidentiality procedures and employee confidentiality agreements to maintain the trade secrecy of our designs and manufacturing processes.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities, in the U.S. and Mexico, including regulations concerning financial reporting and controls, labor relations, minimum pension funding levels, export and import matters, health and safety matters and protection of the environment. While compliance with applicable regulations has not adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance in the future or that these regulations will not change or that the costs of compliance will not be material to us.
 
We must comply with detailed government procurement and contracting regulations and with U.S. Government security regulations, certain of which carry substantial penalty provisions for nonperformance or misrepresentation in the course of negotiations. Our failure to comply with our government procurement, contracting or security obligations could result in penalties or our suspension or debarment from government contracting, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
 
We are required to maintain U.S. Government security clearances in connection with certain activities of Sypris Electronics. These clearances could be suspended or revoked if we were found not to be in compliance with applicable security regulations. Any such revocation or suspension would delay our delivery of products to customers. Although we have adopted policies designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that the approved status of our facilities or personnel will continue without interruption.
 
We are also subject to comprehensive and changing federal, state and local environmental requirements, both in the U.S. and in Mexico, including those governing discharges to air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We use hazardous substances in our operations and, as is the case with manufacturers in general, if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from any properties that we may own or operate, we may be held liable and may be required to pay the cost of remedying the condition. The amount of any resulting liability could be material.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 604 employees, of which 478 were engaged in manufacturing and providing our technical services, 11 were engaged in sales and marketing, 41 were engaged in engineering and 74 were engaged in administration. Approximately 335 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions that expire on various dates through 2017. Excluding certain Mexico employees covered under an annually ratified agreement, collective bargaining agreements covering 139 employees expire within the next 12 months. In response to the near term reduction of significant business in 2015 and 2016, we have engaged in layoffs during the last two years, and our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain new and existing customers. Although we believe overall that relations with our labor unions are positive, there can be no assurance that present and future issues with our unions will be resolved favorably, that negotiations will be successful or that we will not experience a work stoppage, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
