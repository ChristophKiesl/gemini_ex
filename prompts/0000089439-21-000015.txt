Each of our reportable segments is composed of certain operating segments that are aggregated primarily by the nature of products offered. These are the Piping Systems, Industrial Metals, and Climate segments.
Certain administrative expenses and expenses related primarily to retiree benefits at inactive operations are combined into the Corporate and Eliminations classification.  
Financial information concerning segments and geographic information appears under “Note 3 – Segment Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
New housing starts and commercial construction are important determinants of our sales to the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, and plumbing markets because the principal end use of a significant portion of our products is in the construction of single and multi-family housing and commercial buildings.  Repairs and remodeling projects are also important drivers of underlying demand for these products.  In addition, our products are used in various transportation, automotive, and industrial applications.
Piping Systems Segment
The Piping Systems segment is composed of Domestic Piping Systems Group, Great Lakes Copper (Great Lakes), Pexcor Manufacturing Company and Heatlink Group Inc. (collectively, Heatlink Group), Die-Mold Tool Limited (Die-Mold), European Operations, Trading Group, and Jungwoo Metal Ind. Co., LTD (Jungwoo-Mueller).  
The Domestic Piping Systems Group manufactures and distributes copper tube, fittings, line sets, and pipe nipples, and resells steel pipe, brass and plastic plumbing valves, malleable iron fittings and faucets, and plumbing specialties.  These products are manufactured in the U.S., sold in the U.S., and exported to markets worldwide. Our copper tube ranges in size from 1/8 inch to 8 1/8 inch diameter and is sold in various straight lengths and coils.  We are a market leader in the air-conditioning and refrigeration service tube markets and we also supply a variety of water tube in straight lengths and coils used for plumbing applications in virtually every type of construction project.  Our copper fittings, line sets, and related components are produced for the plumbing and heating industry to be used in water distribution systems, heating systems, air-conditioning, and refrigeration applications, and drainage, waste, and vent systems.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 26, 2020, the Company employed approximately 5,007 employees, of which approximately 1,678 were represented by various unions.  Those union contracts will expire as follows:

Location | Expiration Date 
Port Huron, Michigan (Local 218 IAM) | May 7, 2023 
Wynne, Arkansas (MCTP) | November 30, 2024 
Port Huron, Michigan (Local 44 UAW) | June 26, 2022

North Wales, Pennsylvania | July 31, 2021 
Belding, Michigan | September 17, 2021
Fulton, Mississippi | October 2, 2021 
Waynesboro, Tennessee | November 3, 2021 

The union agreements at the Company’s U.K. and Mexico operations are renewed annually.  The Company expects to renew its union contracts without material disruption to its operations. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. The health and safety of our employees is our high priority and in particular, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken additional measures to limit possible infections at the workplace. 
Furthermore, we expect that our employees and members of our Board of Directors will conduct themselves ethically and properly as a matter of course and comply with the guidelines set forth on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
Raw Material and Energy Availability
A substantial portion of our base metal requirements (primarily copper) is normally obtained through short-term supply contracts with competitive pricing provisions (for cathode) and the open market (for scrap).  Other raw materials used in the production of brass, including brass scrap, zinc, tin, and lead are obtained from zinc and lead producers, open-market dealers, and customers with brass process scrap.  Raw materials used in the fabrication of aluminum and plastic products are purchased in the open market from major producers.
Adequate supplies of raw material have historically been available to us from primary producers, metal brokers, and scrap dealers.  Sufficient energy in the form of natural gas, fuel oils, and electricity is available to operate our production facilities.  While temporary shortages of raw material and fuels may occur occasionally, to date they have not materially hampered our operations.
Our copper tube facilities can accommodate both refined copper and certain grades of copper scrap as the primary feedstock.  The Company has commitments from refined copper producers for a portion of its metal requirements for 2021.  Adequate quantities of copper are currently available.  While we will continue to react to market developments, resulting pricing volatility or supply disruptions, if any, could nonetheless adversely affect the Company.
Environmental Proceedings
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a matter of high priority for the Company.  Mueller’s provision for environmental matters related to all properties was $4.2 million for 2020, $1.7 million for 2019, and $2.0 million for 2018.  The reserve for environmental matters was $24.0 million at December 26, 2020 and $20.9 million at December 28, 2019.  Environmental expenses related to non-operating properties are presented below operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and costs related to operating properties are included in cost of goods sold.  We currently anticipate that we will need to make expenditures of approximately $4.3 million for compliance activities related to existing environmental matters during the next three fiscal years.
For a description of material pending environmental proceedings, see “Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Other Business Factors
Our business is not materially dependent on patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, or concessions held.  In addition, expenditures for Company-sponsored research and development activities were not material during 2020, 2019, or 2018.  No material portion of our business involves governmental contracts.  
Seasonality
Our net sales typically moderate in the fourth quarter as a result of the seasonal construction markets and customer shutdowns for holidays, year-end plant maintenance, and physical inventory counts. Also, our working capital typically increases in the first quarter in preparation for the construction season.
SEC Filings
We make available through our internet website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
