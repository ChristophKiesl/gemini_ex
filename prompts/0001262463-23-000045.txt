Item 1. Business
Overview
 Healthtech Solution Inc. (“Healthtech” or the “Company”) is a life sciences company dedicated to building impactful solutions for people and the healthcare system. Our business plan points toward the integration of complementary products and service lines, with the goal of maximizing the potential market for products and services offered by our subsidiaries.
 At year-end 2022, there were five operating subsidiaries in the Healthtech family: Healthtech Wound Care, Inc. (“HWC”), Cellsure, LLC (“Cellsure”), The Clia Lab, LLC (“The Clia Lab”), Medi-Scan Inc. (“MediScan”), and RevHeart Inc. (“RevHeart”). In January we added an important fifth with our acquisition of a majority interest in World Reach Holdings, LLC (“WR Holdings”), along with its affiliated subsidiaries, including, World Reach Health, LLC (“WR Health”), an established distributor of medical products and services that will provide product and service distribution capacity for our other subsidiaries as well as contribute additional product lines. We intend to complete further transactions that will build synergies across the organization, creating a diverse portfolio of assets that still allows us to leverage skillsets and costs among our first partners.
 Our Portfolio Subsidiaries
 Healthtech Wound Care, Inc.
 In January 2022, Healthtech Wound Care, Inc. (“HWC”) acquired a bundle of assets, including intellectual property, related to the business of developing novel wound care products for acute and chronic wounds. HWC has used those assets as the foundation for HWC’s program of identifying and developing a pipeline of human cell and tissue product (HCT/Ps) candidates that we believe have novel mechanisms of action and immediate clinical potential in accordance with applicable federal regulations.

Included among the assets acquired by HWC was a placental membrane allograft designed to act as a covering or barrier for the protection of burns and non-healing wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers. After further development, HWC introduced this product to the market in September, and now markets it in several states under the trademark “DermaBind®”. The product is provided in multiple sizes to be applied directly to clean, debrided wounds where bacterial burden and offloading have been addressed. The base material for the allograft is collected from live, healthy, births from appropriately screened donors. The collected placental tissue is washed, dehydrated, cut, packaged, and sterilized for commercial distribution. DermaBind® is processed in compliance with US CFR Title 21 Part 1271 and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and regulated as a human cell and tissue product. HWC applied for and was granted a Q-code by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. A provisional patent covering the manufacturing steps and clinical uses for DermaBind® was filed in September, 2021. 
 Increasing numbers of patients with chronic and acute wounds are resulting in a growing demand for wound care products globally. An estimated 2.5% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and others. As a result, the adoption rate of wound care products, including traditional therapies, bioactive therapies (including skin substitutes and growth factors) and others, is increasing. Technological advancements in bioactive therapies, such as reduction in overall duration and cost of treatment, have further attracted the patient population to these products. The global wound care market is projected to grow from USD 18.51 billion in 2022 to USD 28.23 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.2% during the forecast period.
 HWC intends to further elucidate the efficacy mechanism of action of DermaBind® in a clinical study in which DermaBind® (in addition to standard of care) is compared to a commercially available product and standard of care alone. DermaBind®, along with standard of care, is expected to significantly reduce treatment times of patients when compared to standard of care alone.
 
The Wound Care Market and Placental Tissue 
 
Skin conditions, which include but are not limited to wounds, can be devastating to patients. There are an estimated 500,000 burns treated in the United States each year, and globally this statistic increases to 11 million injuries per year. The overall mortality rate for burn injury has been estimated to have been 4.9% between 1998-2007 and medical costs for burn treatments approach $2 billion per year. In addition, chronic wounds constitute a large patient base and healing rates remain below 50%. These non-healing chronic wounds are estimated to affect 7 million people in the United States. Patients who suffer from these skin conditions can benefit from rapid treatments that result in at least protection of the wounds.
 
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a major health complication that will affect up to 15% of individuals with diabetes mellitus over their lifetime. The treatment of DFUs is an extremely challenging scenario, as these ulcers may be recalcitrant to SOC treatments, thus increasing the risk of infection and sequelae such as amputations. It is estimated that approximately 15% of all DFUs will result in a lower extremity amputation and develop concomitant medical complications that are associated with increased mortality rates.

DFUs not only have a detrimental effect on a patient’s quality of life, but also pose a significant burden on healthcare facilities and the public and/or private payers who support these facilities. Waycaster et al. noted a recent economic evaluation of Medicare beneficiaries which concluded that the United States spent $32B USD in 2014 on 8.2 million patients. This equates to approximately $4,000 USD per patient.
 
Human amniotic membrane has been used in the treatment of wounds since the early 20th century. Numerous potential applications of this tissue have been investigated since then. Studies have demonstrated that amniotic membranes have anti-inflammatory effects, are antimicrobial, demonstrate anti-scarring, maintain an anti-adhesive activity, are non-immunogenic with low antigenicity, have analgesic properties, and promote re- epithelialization. One noted application is for use in patients with DFUs. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Laurent et al. concluded that “[h]uman amnion/chorion membrane + standard of care treatment heals DFUs significantly faster than standard of care alone.”
 
Facilities for Wound Care Operations
 
HWC’s laboratory facility is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) as a Human Cell and Tissue Establishment, FDA Establishment Identifier (FEI): 3012707547. The facility includes two (2) ISO Class 7 cleanrooms containing twelve (12) ISO Class 5 Biological Safety Cabinets. The equipment and facilities are inspected and validated semiannually by independent contractors to ensure that all are functioning correctly. PBI’s facility conforms to current Good Tissue Practices (21 CFR 1271.150), current Good Manufacturing Practices and is ISO 13485 certified. These facilities are used in manufacturing DermaBind® and will be used in manufacturing other products for commercial use and for experimental use in Investigational New Drug Applications.
The Clia Lab, Inc.
 
In the second half of 2022, Healthtech, in concert with World Reach Health, established an FDA-licensed CLIA laboratory that we named “The CLIA Lab.” This facility is housed at the University of Utah technology campus in Salt Lake City. In January 2023, in connection with Healthtech’s acquisition of a majority interest in WR Holdings, we acquired 100% of the equity in The Clia Lab, Inc.
 The Clia Lab is a certified diagnostic laboratory, which is dedicated to aiding healthcare providers to screen for and monitor specific diseases. The Clia Lab is focused on customer satisfaction, creating tailored programs that suit the individual and complex needs of the healthcare providers, all while delivering accurate, reliable and timely patient test results, no matter where the test is administered.
 The Clia Lab performs tests on clinical specimens to obtain information about the health of a patient via aiding in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases. The CLIA Lab is licensed to perform a multitude of tests, including, without limitation, Covid-19, Flu, RPP Viral Pathogens, Bacterial Pathogens, UTI & Wound, STI, Vaginitis and Fungal. WR Health, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, was a leading distributor of a number of these tests and sold them to other similar diagnostic laboratories, and continues to expand its portfolio of diagnostic products. The Clia Lab will provide a new revenue stream for both Healthtech and WR Health, as well as a market advantage for HWC’s wound care products. We expect to offer bundle packages to our wound care providers, which will include both the clinical test required prior to a wound care treatment as well as the wound care allograft that HWC manufactures.

MediScan, Inc.
 MediScan is a company developing advanced ultrasound imaging and artificial intelligence (“AI”) based image analysis software. Within the past few years, medical professionals have realized the wide-spread versatility of handheld ultrasound devices. Point-of-care ultrasound (“POCUS”) and handheld systems now represent a rapidly growing portion of sales of ultrasound technology in the United States and worldwide. Ultrasound devices with the AI-based software applications MediScan is developing have the potential to enable healthcare professionals to more efficiently triage and prioritize workflows due to enhanced visualization and/or computer-assisted analysis of suspected findings.
 MediScan is developing its AI-based software for analysis of ultrasound images of the chest (primarily lung) and musculoskeletal (“MSK”) system. The software is being trained with validated ultrasound images using AI algorithms. Once sufficiently trained for each targeted disease or injury pattern, we expect that the AI-based software will be capable of analyzing images and studies for suspected diseases or injuries to assist with triage and prioritization in point-of-care settings. These systems will not alter the images and will not be intended to be used as a diagnostic device, at least initially. As training of each system is completed, resulting in proof-of-concept data, MediScan will define and design the necessary validation studies to pursue regulatory clearance for each application, while continuing to enhance the capabilities within each organ or tissue system. In addition to the lead development programs focused on chest and MSK ultrasound software analysis, we are evaluating other organ systems, disease states, or tissues that could benefit from a similar point-of-care (“POC”) solution based on unmet needs and workflow challenges with current solutions. In parallel, we are developing a cloud-based software system capable of converting two-dimensional analog grayscale ultrasound images into a digital three-dimensional high-definition color format with the goal of expanding the visual image available to the healthcare provider (“HCP”).
 MediScan has filed two provisional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office listed below, and through its ongoing research efforts, MediScan expects to develop additional technology and application methods of strategic value to the Company, for which it may seek patent protection.
 
System Method, Apparatus, and Computer Program Product for Ultrasonic Clinical Decision Support;
and
System, Method, and Apparatus for Monitoring Cardiac Tissue Damage.

 We intend to market our imaging technology through the Software as a Service ("SaaS") model. SaaS is a business model where the software system is held in the cloud and accessed by a local computer, tablet or smartphone via the internet. The healthcare industry is adopting the SaaS model for clinical information systems (such as PACS, EHR, telehealth applications, treatment planning software) and nonclinical information systems (such as billing, revenue cycle management, and supply chain management).

 We believe the market opportunity for AI-based medical image analysis is large, that it will grow rapidly over the next ten years, and that regulatory and industry solutions are now developed to the point of making the commercialization and adoption of medical AI-based software feasible. In regard to the handheld POCUS probes and devices alone, the global portable ultrasound market size is projected to reach $3.9 billion in 2026, according to Fortune Business Insights. The market stood at $1.8 billion in sales in 2019 with a projected CAGR of 13.6% from 2020 to 2026. North America accounted for $733 million in sales in 2019 and is expected to remain the market leader.
 The global ultrasound image analysis software market, separate from the POCUS hardware market described above, is projected to reach between $2.9 and $4.5 billion by 2025. Both markets are expected to synergistically drive each other, with increasing adoption of POCUS hardware due to AI image analysis reducing expertise to perform POCUS. Furthermore, these projections may already be underestimating the adoption of POCUS devices due to the acceleration of use throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, where POC solutions that limited patient movement and provided information allowing for rapid triage became necessities.
 Within the last three years, numerous AI-based software assistants have been cleared by the FDA. New solutions to large scale integration of these narrowly focused algorithms are becoming available as “medical AI algorithm marketplaces”. These marketplaces may be able to aggregate the growing number of algorithms, and seamlessly integrate them into radiologists’ or healthcare systems’ workflows. The currently available medical AI algorithm marketplaces and more advanced infrastructure solutions being designed by large companies could lower the barriers to entry for new products with highly focused niche applications.
 RevHeart, Inc.
 RevHeart is a discovery stage company focused on novel approaches to correct cardiac rhythm abnormalities using electromagnetic waveforms in an innovative approach called entrainment, building from advances gained in other disease states. Entrainment, which is currently used in tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), works by linking the patient’s abnormal heart rhythm together with a normal heart rhythm, and gently encouraging the abnormal rhythm to revert to a more normal rhythm. As part of these efforts, RevHeart is developing software technology that compares a healthy heart rhythm electronic signal with a damaged heart’s signal, and subsequently derives an electronic signal representing the potentially curative waveform. Then, through a monitored feed-back mechanism, the curative electronic signal would be introduced to the patient to achieve a reversion to the healthy heart rhythm. RevHeart plans to develop the software and prototype of the device capable of testing the hypothesis that entrainment can convert abnormal electrocardiogram (“ECG”) waveforms into normal ECG waveforms through iterative corrective signals.
 RevHeart has filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office listed below, and through its ongoing research efforts, RevHeart expects to develop additional technology and application methods of strategic value to the Company, for which it may seek patent protection.
 
System, Method and Apparatus for Stimulating Cardiac Muscle Injury Recovery.

All cardiac rhythm abnormalities could potentially benefit from the RevHeart device and entrainment, such as atrial fibrillation (“AFib”) and conduction system diseases. AFib is projected to affect between 6 and 12 million people in the United States by 2050. According to Markets and Markets, the cardiac monitoring and rhythm management devices market is projected to reach $26. billion worldwide by 2025 with a projected CAGR of 4.0% from 2020 to 2025, with the United States occupying the largest share of the market.
 
Our Portfolio Investment
 
Our business plan contemplates that, from time-to-time, we will acquire subsidiaries in their early stages of development, nurture them until they are market-ready, then transfer our control via spin-out or otherwise, while retaining a minority interest in the newly-independent company as a Portfolio Investment. At present, we hold one Portfolio Investment, a 5.5% interest in the equity of Varian Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Varian”),
Varian Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Varian is an emerging biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel, targeted oncology therapies with transformational potential for cancer patients. Varian’s strategy is to identify, license and develop a pipeline of therapeutic candidates that they believe have novel mechanisms of action and transformative clinical potential, and then to bring the requisite scientific and clinical resources together to move them forward in the promise of safer and more effective cancer treatments.
 Varian is developing VAR-101/102, a high-potency, specific, atypical Protein Kinase C iota (“aPKCi”) inhibitor in two formulations. Recently, numerous scientific publications have identified aPKCi as an oncogene, whose presence and activation has been implicated in the development and growth of multiple forms of human cancer including basal cell carcinoma (“BCC”), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”), pancreatic, non-small cell lung cancel (“NSCLC”), acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and others. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in VAR-101/102, an aPKCi inhibitor, has demonstrated dose dependent anti-tumor activity in murine and human BCC cell lines, as well as other cancer models. Varian intends to develop VAR-101 in a topical formulation for BCC which has the potential to offer optimal clinical utility in BCC as a surgical neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. VAR-102, an oral formulation of the active aPKCi inhibitor, lends itself to broader applications in multiple tumor types. Varian believes that VAR-101 and VAR-102, if approved, could represent significant medical and commercial opportunities. Varian has agreements in place with contract manufacturers and research organizations, and consulting groups, for API synthesis, formulation and non-clinical studies to progress the development of VAR-101 and VAR-102 in IND enabling activities.
 
In May 2021 Healthtech Solutions acquired all of the equity in Varian. Between May 2021 and November 2021, Healthtech Solutions contributed approximately $900,000 to fund the ongoing operations of Varian, while Healthtech management and the Varian management team jointly pursued the financing that Varian requires to become market-ready. In November 2021, the parties agreed to sever the relationship: Healthtech Solutions returned 94.5% of the equity in Varian to its original owners. Healthtech Solutions now holds the remaining 5.5% equity interest in Varian as its initial Portfolio Investment.

Healthcare Regulation in General
 Our future business operations and activities in the U.S. may be directly or indirectly subject to certain federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of health information, and state and federal laws designed to guard against healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, those described below.

● | HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, established comprehensive requirements related to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. It governs patient privacy practices of healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses (or “covered entities”), as well as their respective business associates to the extent that they perform services for or on behalf of the covered entities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. HIPAA also mandates notification in the event of a breach and regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions. Covered entities and business associates may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, as well as enforcement by state attorneys general, for violations of HIPAA or its implementing regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | HIPAA also imposes federal criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. 
● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
● | The federal Civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government, alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. 
● | The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies. 
● | Analogous state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid, other state programs, or, in some states, private third-party payors. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. These state laws, which may be even more stringent than the HIPAA requirements, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and are often not preempted by the federal requirements.

These and other regulations of the FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. We will also be subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), will monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.
 We plan to gain access for our products within the E.U. market. In the E.U., a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017 which imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements (EU MDR).
 The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to obtain approvals for our products.
 Employees
 As of this filing, we employ approximately 18 people on a full-time basis, all of whom are located in the U.S. Of the total employees, 11 are in manufacturing, 1 performs testing services for The Clia Lab, 1 is in research and development; 3 perform sales and marketing functions for WR Health; and 2 are in general and administration. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
