ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service (“SaaS”). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers’ vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.
We have a large global presence, with vehicle subscriptions in over 120 countries across six continents. We currently serve a highly diverse customer base, including 4,800 fleet operators, which represented 69% of our subscription revenue for fiscal year 2023. We target sales of our enterprise fleet management solutions to customers who desire a premium solution, generally for large fleets, which we define as fleets of 50 or more vehicles. Large fleets accounted for over 92% of our fleet subscriptions at March 31, 2023. We believe we have a satisfied customer base and, among our more than 1,000 large fleet operator customers, we experienced an annual customer retention rate of 99% in fiscal year 2023. In addition, for large fleets with 500 or more vehicles, we experienced an annual customer retention rate in excess of 97% in fiscal year 2023. We have multinational enterprise fleet customer deployments with companies such as Baker Hughes, BP, Chevron, DHL, G4S, Halliburton, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Schlumberger, Shell, The Linde Group, Total and Weatherford. We also offer a range of subscription-based fleet and vehicle management solutions to meet the needs and price points of small fleet operators and consumers. Our safety and security features, including driver performance and vehicle monitoring, are important attributes of our solutions for these customers.
With the exception of fiscal year 2021, we have consistently grown our customer base. As evidence of this growth, subscribers, one of our key operating metrics and a factor influencing our rate of subscription revenue growth, increased at a compound annual growth rate of 10.8% from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2023, and as of March 31, 2023, we tracked and managed over 1,001,800 subscribers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal year 2021 represented the only year of net subscriber contraction over this period of 73,800 subscribers, resulting in a 6.1% reduction in subscription revenue for the period, on a constant currency basis. As a further indicator of our scale, in fiscal year 2023, we collected data on approximately 184 million trips per month and recorded approximately 11 billion vehicle positions per month. The monthly price charged per subscriber varies among our customers depending on the services and features they require, hardware options, customer size, route to market and geographic location of the customer. Consequently, our rate of subscription revenue growth is influenced by not only the rate of growth in the number of subscribers but also by the evolving mix of our subscriber base.
Industry Overview
Challenges Facing Fleet Operators Worldwide
Fleet managers operate in an increasingly competitive and highly regulated global environment. Timely and accurate decision-making enabled by solutions that provide real-time visibility into vehicle location and driver performance is critical to managing a safe, efficient fleet. In some developing areas of the world, ensuring driver and vehicle safety and security is also particularly challenging given high crime rates, which have resulted in automotive insurance mandates and regulatory requirements for vehicle tracking. Consequently, fleet managers and consumers demand solutions that promote driver and passenger safety, mitigate risk, drive operational efficiencies, improve security and reduce automotive insurance costs. The business environment for fleet managers is further complicated by the large number of transportation-related regulatory and compliance requirements worldwide, and the frequency with which rules and regulations change.
Legacy fleet management solutions inadequately address industry needs as many businesses use discrete manual processes, such as spreadsheet and paper-based systems and telephones, to monitor vehicle and driver activity. These approaches are labor intensive, prone to error, do not provide continuous monitoring of fleets, make it difficult to optimize fleet utilization, manage operating costs and generate minimal business intelligence. Additionally, legacy fleet management technology frequently provides limited functionality beyond basic location-based tracking and makes it difficult for fleet 
operators to fully benefit from the cost savings and efficiency improvements associated with more robust fleet management offerings.
Fleet operators face many significant challenges, which can include:
•Significant operating costs. According to the American Transport Research Institute’s 2021 data, fuel represents 40%, repair & maintenance 17%, truck insurance premiums 8% and tires 4% of vehicle-based trucking operational costs per mile. Combined, these factors account for 69% of vehicle-based operational costs per mile, all of which can be reduced through connected fleet solutions and the process of positively impacting driving behaviors, including by reducing behaviors like speeding, harsh acceleration, harsh braking and excessive idling. 
•Poor visibility into fleet operations. Fleet operators frequently maintain vehicles across multiple geographic regions and often lack visibility into their fleets and oversight of their drivers, and this problem is growing in significance as fleets start to electrify and managers have to navigate the complexities of hybrid fleets. Poor fleet visibility makes it challenging to optimize fleet utilization, vehicle fleet size and miles driven while still meeting core business and customer servicing requirements. Poor driver oversight makes it difficult for operators to validate hours worked or customers visited, incentivize greater efficiency and discourage unproductive, undesirable or dangerous worker behavior.
•Challenges in maintaining regulatory compliance. Internal compliance and reporting is driven by legislative and regulatory requirements, which are often subject to change, from regulatory authorities in nearly every jurisdiction globally. This can be particularly burdensome for fleet operators managing large vehicle fleets in multiple jurisdictions. For example, in the United States, fleet operators can face numerous complex regulatory requirements, including mandatory hours of service compliance and fuel tax reporting and more recently electronic logging devices (“ELD”) legislation that requires truck drivers to log their hours of service electronically.
•Challenges in managing risk. Fleet operators are responsible for hiring, training and identifying risks associated with their drivers. Vehicle crashes are a leading cause of workplace injury and lead to significant costs for fleet operators, including financial liability and increased insurance premiums. Fleet operators need visibility into driving behavior to proactively identify and remediate drivers with poor driving habits.
•Inefficient data management. Fleet operators receive operational information from many disparate sources, including communications from their technicians and customers, paper-based reports, third-party receipts for items such as fuel purchases, vehicle maintenance logs and customer invoices. While simply collecting this unstructured data is burdensome, organizing and analyzing the data to identify trends and other actionable business intelligence can be even more challenging.
Challenges Facing Fleet Operators and Consumers in Developing Markets
In certain developing regions of the world, driver safety and vehicle security are significant concerns given high crime rates and the impact these higher crime rates have on consumers, insurance costs and regulatory requirements. More specifically, fleet operators and consumers often need to address challenges including:
•Managing the impact of crime. Vehicle crime rates in developing regions of the world often far exceed those in the United States and Western Europe, resulting in potentially significant costs for fleet operators and consumers.
•Reducing insurance costs. In developed and developing regions, insurers often provide incentives for fleet operators and consumers who subscribe to a safety and security mobile asset management solution. Some insurance providers will not insure vehicles that lack a tracking solution or will make the insurance premium cost prohibitive without one. Furthermore, insurance providers’ interest in safety and security solutions has increased following the introduction of driver performance monitoring solutions, which can enable innovative usage-based insurance and claims management initiatives.
•Complying with regulatory mandates. The growing introduction of stringent occupational health and safety legislation in developing markets is adding pressure to fleet operators, who need to fulfill their duty of care while also complying with laws regulating driving hours, rest time, fuel taxes, etc.
Industry Trends
There have been substantial advances in the capabilities, reliability and affordability of technologies that can be used to cost-effectively collect and disseminate large amounts of vehicle data and video footage. GPS positioning and advanced on-board systems generate valuable, objective real-time information, which provides the basis for driver and vehicle management solutions. Similarly, significant advances in the performance, reliability and affordability of fixed and wireless networks, computing power and data storage capabilities have supported the rise of cloud computing that enables the delivery of SaaS. These technological advances and market shifts have helped to foster demand for subscription-based fleet and mobile asset management solutions like ours.
While fleet and mobile asset management solutions can offer a wide range of features and benefits, the reasons for adopting these solutions often vary by customer type and geography. In developed regions, including North America and Western Europe, many fleet operators adopt fleet management software solutions in order to obtain greater visibility over their vehicles and mobile workforces, to achieve cost savings through efficiency improvements, including reduced fuel consumption, and to reduce regulatory compliance burdens. In many developing regions, including Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, the security of personnel and asset protection features afforded by vehicle tracking and monitoring, resulting in greater asset visibility and a lower impact of theft, are also important reasons for the adoption of fleet and mobile asset management solutions. In Australia and parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, compliance with health and safety standards and policies are a key reason for adoption of these systems. Managing the transition to – and operation of – electric fleets is a key priority for fleets in Europe and elsewhere. Recognizing the variety of motivations influencing our existing and potential customers is an important aspect of developing and marketing our solutions.
Global and multinational companies are increasingly looking to consolidate their fleet management systems by moving to providers that have global reach. This is primarily driven by the desire to have a secure centralized view across their fleets and impose set global standards specifically relating to driver management and safety. These companies also recognize the advantages of gathering vast quantities of data to draw new insights into their global fleet operations.
A research publication by Berg Insight says the integration of cameras to enable various video-based solutions in commercial vehicle environments is one of the most apparent trends in the fleet telematics sector today. Growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 18.0% they forecast that the active installed base of video telematics systems will reach almost 8.8 million units in North America by 2027. In Europe, the active installed base is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 17.9% to reach 2.5 million video telematics systems by 2027. The video telematics market is served by many companies including video specialists, fleet telematics players and hardware-focussed suppliers. With MiX Vision AI which was launched in fiscal year 2022 and enhanced with multiple software and hardware updates in 2023, we are meeting an ever-broader range of needs in the video telematics market.
Market Opportunity
We believe that the addressable market for our fleet management solutions is large, growing and remains largely under-penetrated. According to a report by ABI Research (“ABI”), there were approximately 230 million commercial vehicles registered globally by the end of December 2022. Global fleet management penetration was estimated to reach 23%. ABI forecasts that by 2030, the number of registered commercial vehicles will be approximately 287 million. 
In addition to the growing market opportunity in commercial fleet vehicles, we believe there is a large and under-penetrated market to provide a tailored set of safety and security solutions to non-commercial passenger vehicles. Worldwide, the pool of motor vehicles is large and growing, particularly in developing markets. We estimate that there are approximately 7.7 million non-commercial passenger vehicles in operation in South Africa, as of April 2023, utilizing latest vehicle population information available from the National Traffic Information Systems. We believe the potential rate of consumer adoption of mobile asset management solutions is highest in developing regions where vehicle tracking and monitoring features can help to improve driver and passenger safety, reduce the impact of theft by improving stolen vehicle recovery rates and reduce consumer automotive insurance rates.

In fiscal year 2023, among our more than 1,000 large fleet operator customers, we experienced an annual customer retention rate of 99%. We maintain a strong focus on monitoring and continuously enhancing our customer satisfaction levels.
Service and Support
Installation of our solutions in our customers’ vehicles is generally provided by us or our third-party network, which includes dealers and distributors and installation partners. Customer care and technical support services are provided by our offices in Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In many cases, our dealers and distributors also provide customers with tier-one customer support services. Our regional offices and dealers and distributors are, in turn, supported by our central technical support team in South Africa that handles any escalated issues. Existing customers can also access customer and technical support directly through our web or mobile applications. Our technical support department is composed of a team of highly skilled staff who are familiar with all of our products, including our entire range of software and service solutions as well as our hardware. The MiX Learning Centre, now known as Academy X, is used by staff and customers around the world to undertake online training to learn about new products and enhancements.
We offer warranties of varying duration on our products. Product warranties are predominantly for a one-year period but periods of up to three years are provided in certain geographic locations. Our Beam-e product carries a lifetime warranty (to the extent that the unit remains in the vehicle into which it was installed for the original subscriber). Warranty expenses are not a significant portion of our total costs.
Research and Development
As of March 31, 2023, our product development group consists of 161 full-time staff responsible for software, hardware and firmware development, quality assurance and programme management. Our primary development group is based in South Africa, and we have additional development resources in India and the United States. Our software development teams employ an agile development methodology, while our engineering teams use traditional waterfall project management methods. During fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, we invested $9.5 million, $9.3 million and $7.2 million respectively, in research and development.
Our investment in development is core to our business strategy. Our research and development efforts principally involve software development, firmware development, hardware design and related test equipment. Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. In addition, we have enhanced certain of our hardware components to extend their functionality and reduce component and manufacturing costs.
We have been successful in expanding our product offerings over time, mostly through internal development for which we own all Intellectual Property. Highlights from the fiscal year 2023 include:
•The deployment of 18 system-wide platform updates and 21 mobile app updates to our live environments.
•Extensions to the embedded dashboard and analytics platform launched in fiscal 2022 for premium fleet customers.
•Updates on certain hardware platforms and accessories.
•Extension of the MiX OEM Connect solution to leverage more telematics services provided by Original Equipment Manufacturers (truck makers). 
•Extension of our MiX Vision AI solution to support multiple cameras.
•Certification and release of our Canadian ELD solution. 
•Deeper integration of alternative hardware enablers for certain markets.
Our DevOps and SaaS operations are ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 certified with a formalized quality policy and consistent monitoring of internal processes, supplier and solution performance. We outsource all hardware manufacturing to third parties.
Technology
Our solutions are offered using a multi-tenant SaaS architecture that scales rapidly to support additional new subscribers through the addition of incremental data processing and storage capacity. This architecture flexibility allows us to sustain high levels of uptime without degradation of system performance, despite significant subscriber growth. Our existing architecture and infrastructure has been designed with sufficient capacity to meet our current and anticipated future needs. Our subscription-based fleet and consumer service offerings are designed to be accessible via a standard web browser or mobile device application.
Our solutions typically include a proprietary in-vehicle device that incorporates off-the-shelf components, generally including a cellular modem, GPS receiver and memory capacity sufficient to run our firmware, which gathers vehicle location, time, speed, ignition status, miles driven and various vehicle and driver statistics. This information is collected at a predefined frequency and then sent to our receivers at secure third-party data centers, generally via a commercial cellular network. The information is then processed and delivered to our customers through our web-based and mobile device applications. Our solutions enable our fleet customers to access large volumes of historical and real-time data, monitor the location and status of their fleet vehicles and drivers, view a wide selection of reports and key performance indicator dashboards and generate valuable, actionable business intelligence.
We store data, host our solutions and serve our customers from third-party data centers located in Algiers in Algeria, Sydney in Australia, Muscat in Oman, Dublin in Ireland, and Virginia in the United States. In fiscal year 2023, we also added third-party data center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In addition to data hosted at third-party data centers, the vast majority of our cloud-based SaaS service leverages Amazon Web Services. Our data management facilities provide us with both physical security, including manned security, biometric access controls and systems security, including firewalls, encryption, redundant power and environmental controls. We believe that our third-party hosting facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional capacity will be available as needed to accommodate planned expansion of our operations.
MiX Vision AI is a fully integrated, connected camera solution with a built-in artificial intelligence processor which uses Machine Vision based Video Analytic technology to detect or monitor road events (ADAS) such as un-signalled lane departure, forward collision and following distance (also known as Headway Monitoring Warning) and unsafe driver behaviour (DSM) such as fatigue, distraction, smoking, unfastened seatbelt and phone usage. The MiX Vision AI infra-red capabilities ensure clear footage is captured at night and can alert the driver in real-time of dangerous behaviours by triggering a voice warning and audible or visual notifications with the optional AI Driver coach (R-Watch). The MiX Vision AI will also upload events (and the respective video recordings) to the MiX Fleet Manager platform where they can be reviewed by a fleet manager. They can be used for coaching the drivers, therefore reducing risks and ensuring safe trips. The device also supports Incab recording full colour images with wide-angle view of the cab with built in microphone to record audio.
Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely to a limited extent on patent, trademark and copyright law. A patent covering certain aspects of our Beam-e product was issued in South Africa during fiscal year 2014 and a patent covering a method for driver verification was issued during fiscal year 2015. 
We typically enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees and independent consultants and other advisors. We also seek these protective agreements from some of our suppliers and subcontractors who have access to sensitive information regarding our intellectual property.
We incur intellectual property expenses that arise primarily from costs associated with documenting, applying for, and maintaining domestic and international patents and trademarks.
Competition
The rapidly evolving market for our solutions is competitive and highly fragmented, particularly by geography and customer segment. We currently compete with numerous providers of fleet and mobile asset management solutions that range from small, regional providers to midsized multinational providers, such as Cartrack, to large global providers, such as Geotab, Samsara and Navman Wireless. Many of our competitors offer fleet or mobile asset management software solutions to particular industry segments or in limited geographic regions. For example, we compete with Michelin (Masternaut) in Europe, in the US we compete with Geotab and Samsara, in South Africa we compete with Netstar and Cartrack for consumer and small fleet mobile asset management deployments in South Africa, respectively.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•functionality and reliability;
•total cost of ownership;
•breadth and depth of application functionality for fleet deployments;
•product performance;
•interoperability;
•brand and reputation;
•customer service;
•distribution channels, including a global footprint and the ability to service multinationals; 
•regional geographic expertise including localized language support and support for applicable government regulations;
•size of customer base and reference accounts within key industry segments;
•ability to deliver ongoing value and return on investment; 
•ease of deployment and ease of use;
•relevant industry domain expertise and functionality; and
•the financial resources of the vendor.
We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors.

Government Regulation
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to our business operations, including laws applicable to providers of Internet and mobile services both domestically and internationally, as we collect data, including personal data, disseminate data and, in some cases, sell data. The application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, marketing, advertising, inadvertent disclosure and consumer protection in many instances is unclear or unsettled.
The transmission of data over the Internet and cellular networks is a critical component of our SaaS business model. Additionally, as cloud computing continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely, particularly in the areas of data privacy and data security. In particular, the dynamic regulatory environment in the European Union and the United Kingdom, made more uncertain due to Brexit, is resulting in additional and increasingly complex regulation in these areas and we believe that the similarly dynamic regulatory environment of the United States, will follow suit. New laws governing data privacy and data security will furthermore be enacted in many other regions. Laws governing the solicitation, collection, processing or use of data could impair our ability to manage and report on customer data, which is integral to the delivery of our SaaS solutions. Increased regulation and the expansion of our business and operations globally have required us to devote legal and other resources to address this regulation. We continuously update and will continue to evaluate our group data protection and security policies, charters and procedures, to assist in maintaining data privacy and data security in line with international practices.
Data privacy regulations and applicable laws in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will regulate our ability to use the data we gather from our customers and increase the cost of doing business and could result in claims being brought by our customers or third parties. As discussed below, South Africa, which is currently our largest market, has its own data protection and security law which came into full effect on July 1, 2021.
South African Regulatory Environment
The Protection of Personal Information Act, No. 4 of 2013 (the “POPI Act”) was promulgated into law in South Africa in November 2013 and came into full effect on July 1, 2021. Any failure to comply with the POPI Act may result in a fine not exceeding R10 million and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years, depending on the severity of such failure.
The purpose of the POPI Act is to promote the privacy of data subjects by establishing a legal framework to regulate the processing of personally identifiable information by mandating juristic persons to implement security measures that uphold the data protection principles and ultimately providing redress through the Information Regulator.
The POPI Act’s implementation has had an impact on our data security and business costs, practices and procedures in South Africa. Data protection principles and integration remain an ongoing business priority.
Several existing South African statutes regulate electronic communications, including the Electronic Communications Act, No. 36 of 2005 as amended, and the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, No. 25 of 2002, which apply to several aspects of our business. These statutes regulate the generation, communication, production, processing, sending, receiving, recording, retaining, storing, displaying and use of information, document or signature by or in electronic form.
The Private Security Industry Regulation Act, No. 56 of 2001 (the “PSIRA Act”) also applies to our South African business and governs the vehicle recovery industry in South Africa. The PSIRA Act was enacted for the purposes of, inter alia: (i) the achievement and maintenance of a trustworthy and legitimate private security industry which acts in terms of the principles contained in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act No. 108 of 1996, and other applicable law, and is aimed at ensuring that there is greater safety and security in the country and; (ii) to regulate the private security industry and to exercise effective control over the practice of the occupation of security service providers in the public and national interest and the interest of the private security industry itself.
The National Environmental Management: Waste Act, No. 59 of 2008 (the “NEM: WA Act”) applies to producers of electronic waste (“e-waste”). The NEM: WA Act governs the legal reforms regulating the waste management standards, norms and/or practices in order to protect the health and well-being of communities, and the environment. The NEM: WA Act also provides for the creation of integrated waste management and industry waste management schemes. We are a member of the electronic Waste Association of South Africa (“e-WASA”) Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) scheme which is a conduit in fulfilling the obligations under the regulations and ensuring the environmentally sound management of e-waste. The scheme also responds to the socio-economic challenges and opportunities arising from high volumes of e-waste such as job creation, skills development as set out in the National Development Scheme and Sustainable Development Goals.
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
The South African government established a legislative framework for the promotion of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (“B-BBEE”). Achievement of B-BBEE objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting for the various components of B-BBEE which relates to:
•Ownership - measuring the share of Black ownership and corresponding rights in the business, including voting rights among others. 
•Management Control - reflecting the percentage of Black people in managerial positions ranging from junior management upwards.
•Skills Development - measuring the amount of money that was spent on the training and development of Black people including amongst others short courses, bursaries and learnerships.
•Enterprise and Supplier Development (including Preferential Procurement) - with enterprise development measuring contributions to, and the development of, small Black-owned businesses with the objective of enabling them to supply goods and services to the company in the future; with supplier development measuring contributions to, and the development of, Black-owned suppliers to help grow their businesses; and with preferential procurement measuring the extent to which goods and services are procured from suppliers that are empowered and have a good B-BBEE rating; and
•Socio-Economic Development - assessing the initiatives that the company supports often to the benefit of groups of individuals and communities with the objective of promoting income-generating activities and sustainable access to the economy for these beneficiaries. 
The B-BBEE Codes have a continuous review process which resulted in new B-BBEE Codes coming into effect on May 1, 2015, with more onerous compliance requirements, and proposed amendments. Various amendments have been made over the years which have had an impact on the Skills Development and Enterprise and Supplier Development (including Preferential Procurement) pillars. In addition, some definitions and interpretations were further clarified, and a few general principles were amended. MiX Telematics has always stayed abreast of these changes and made the necessary adjustments.
It is important for us to make a meaningful contribution to the country, and we view the applicable B-BBEE objectives as an opportunity for us to ensure a brighter future for all, moreover in the context of the National Development Plan 2030. In addition, B-BBEE objectives are pursued, by and large, by requiring parties who contract with corporate, governmental and State-Owned Enterprises in South Africa to achieve B-BBEE compliance through satisfaction of the applicable scorecard. Parties improve their B-BBEE contributor level when contracting with businesses that have earned good B-BBEE contributor levels in relation to their scorecards. This was very evident in April 2023 when President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the Employment Equity Amendment Bill (the “Amendment Bill”) into law. The main objective of these amendments to the Employment Equity Act of 1998 (the “Employment Equity Act”) is to enable the Employment and Labour Minister to regulate sector-specific Employment Equity (“EE”) targets and compliance criteria to issue EE Compliance Certificates in terms of Section 53 of the Employment Equity Act. Practically speaking it has bestowed the government with the right to set specific equity targets by sector and region. Companies that are wanting to do business with the government will be required to submit a certificate from the Department confirming that they are in compliance with the Employment Equity Act and its objectives. While these targets are out for public comment, we will ensure we address the regulations that the minister will put in place as we anticipate that it could have a significant impact on the way we comply with the Employment Equity Act, especially on a practical level. Furthermore, we have noted that, to ensure these EE objectives become a reality, the law now compels labour inspectors to inspect and assess workplaces and to issue employers with compliance orders. 
We have nine material end-customers, which require MiX Telematics Enterprise SA Proprietary Limited to maintain at least a B-BBEE contributor between level 1 and 2 as measured under the new B-BBEE Codes. The value of these contracts represented 3.3% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2023. MX Telematics Enterprise SA Proprietary Limited has previously attained the compliance targets and furthermore has maintained not only their position on the scorecard to the highest level possible but also its Black ownership in particular that of Black Women. Failing to achieve applicable B-BBEE objectives could jeopardize our ability to maintain existing business or to secure future business from corporate, governmental or State-Owned Enterprises that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
U.S. Regulatory Environment
In the United States, the rules and regulations to which we may be subject include those promulgated under the authority of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), state regulators, and regulator enforcement positions and expectations. The FTC has expressed interest in particular in the mobile environment and services that collect data that the FTC considers to be of a more sensitive nature than other data, such as location-based information. The FTC could deem our transceiver products such as our in-vehicle devices as collecting data of a sensitive nature. In addition to FTC scrutiny on the consumer side, many fleet drivers in the U.S. may belong to a union, which triggers some degree of oversight from the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”). The NLRB has taken increasing notice of the privacy rights on unionized employees, and future NLRB rules could affect our business model or the way in which our corporate clients use our solutions.
Our business is affected by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users, which may include data defined as personal information under applicable law. 
At the state level, all states have implemented security breach notification laws. Many states have adopted issue-specific laws pertaining to use of GPS, biometrics, among other technologies. Additionally, several states, including California, Virginia, Maryland, and Utah, have enacted laws creating new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and placing increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “CCPA”), requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. Other U.S. states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah, have enacted similar 
— but not identical — laws. Certain of these laws are applicable only to consumer data and may not be applicable to us in the business-to-business context. As our business is directed exclusively to business consumers, we may not be subject to all such consumer-directed privacy laws. Nonetheless, we must evaluate whether and to what extent we are required to comply with any such law; to the extent that we are subject to these or other privacy laws, we may be required to implement additional processes or procedures or change the way in which we do business, ultimately increasing costs and limiting our ability to collect, use, and share data subject to those laws. 
Other states, including Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have recently passed similar privacy laws requiring businesses to provide privacy notices and enhanced consumer rights to residents. Failure to comply with privacy laws could result in penalties.
In addition, several U.S. state laws require data owners to implement reasonable security measures to protect the personal data collected from residents. These laws generally require a data owner to implement reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information, and to protect the personal data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. Although most of these state laws generally require an entity to maintain appropriate security, at least one state (Massachusetts) has adopted comprehensive data privacy requirements to protect personal data.
California was the first state to enact an Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity law, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The law requires manufacturers of any internet-connected devices to equip them with “reasonable” security features that are: appropriate for the nature and function of the device; appropriate for the information it may collect, contain, or transmit; and designed to protect the device and any information contained within the device from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. While there is no private right of action, this law may subject us to potential governmental enforcement actions for noncompliance.
Finally, we use GPS satellites to obtain location data for our in-vehicle devices. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, which does not currently impose additional laws and/or regulations on the ability to access location data. We cannot assure that it will not do so in the future. Any regulatory hurdles could impede the functionality and/or cost of our solutions, which could adversely affect our business. The communication systems that we use to host and transmit data may be subject to security incidents, which may also subject the Company to regulatory enforcement and client pressures.
Globally, governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, regulations, and standards covering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, marketing online, the use of data to inform marketing, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use, processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual internet users. New regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase the costs of doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.
We make public statements about our use and disclosure of personal data, including through our privacy policy. Although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees or vendors fail to comply with our published policies, and documentation. The publication of our privacy policy and other statements that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices.
Any failure or perceived failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures, or measures relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, or client communications) by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our clients and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, marketing, consumer communications and information security in the United States, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new services and maintain and grow our client base and increase revenue.
European Union Regulatory Environment
We are subject to regulation under the laws of the European Union. Of particular relevance with regard to the regulation of our solutions are matters of data protection and privacy. Any processing of personal data in the course of the provision of services is governed by the European Union data protection regime. The framework legislation at a European Union level in respect of data protection is the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”). The EU GDPR creates a single legal framework that applies across all EU member states, and in some circumstances, to processors in a state outside of the European Union where this activity affected EU citizens. The EU GDPR has compliance obligations for data controllers and data processors (we regard our solutions as primarily falling within the processor obligations, where we are providing a service on behalf of our customers, the controller).In addition, local Member State data protection and privacy laws apply as well. Some of these place obligations additional to the EU GDPR on organizations operating in the European Union, such as express suppression of positioning and speeding data when vehicles are used for private trips.
Failure to follow the EU GDPR requirements can have sanctions. For example, individuals can have a right to claim damages and National Data Protection Authorities (“NDPAs”) are able to impose fines for violations up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover, or 20 million Euro, whichever is greater. NDPAs have the power to carry out audits, request information, obtain access to premises and compel implementation of specific business practices where there are compliance concerns and risks. Data controllers must be able to demonstrate that the personal data of any data subject can be lawfully processed on one of the six specified grounds, and flow down compliance obligations onto a processor.
The EU GDPR adopts a risk-based approach to compliance, under which controllers and processors bear responsibility for assessing the degree of risk that their processing activities pose to data subjects. A controller may be required to perform data protection impact assessments before any processing that uses new technology and is likely to result in a high risk to data subjects. The EU GDPR requires controllers and processors to maintain records of their processing activities, and deal with a data security breach in a specific manner. Under the EU GDPR, data subjects have specific rights in certain circumstances, for example, the right to request that businesses delete their personal data (the right to be forgotten); to object to their personal data being processed; and to obtain a copy of their personal data within a set time frame.
Data flows within the European Union are not restricted, but some data out flows from the European Union are subject to restrictions to ensure an adequate protection for EU citizens’ personal data. Where a third country benefits from an “adequacy decision” in place, there are no restrictions on the transfer of personal data to that country. During the course of 2023 the EU is expected to adopt the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which will be an adequacy decision for the benefit of US companies who choose to adhere to a voluntary regulatory framework. Where no adequacy decision is in place, data transfers typically require the adoption of ‘appropriate safeguards’, such as the adoption of “standard contractual clauses” and a “transfer impact assessment” to ensure appropriate protection is in place for the data in the receiving country.
United Kingdom Regulatory Environment
As a result of its departure from the European Union, the United Kingdom is no longer subject to the EU law, which includes the EU GDPR framework. However, upon leaving the EU the UK transposed the EU GDPR into UK law, creating the UK GDPR, and making only minor modifications to the text of the law. Consequently at present, the United Kingdom and European Union regimes are materially the same in terms of the obligations they impose and the rights they create. With respect to international data transfers, the UK does have its own powers for assessing the adequacy of third countries, and its own standard contract clauses and risk assessment process. In March 2023, the UK published a bill to reform some aspects of UK data protection law. Whilst these reforms are relatively modest, they will lead to greater diversion between the UK and EU versions of GDPR.
Cross-border Data Flows between the United Kingdom and the European Union
As a non-EU member state, the United Kingdom constitutes a ‘third country’ and falls outside the free-data flow area between EU member states. Likewise, EU Member States are third countries for the purposes of UK GDPR. However, for the time being both the EU and the UK benefit from mutual adequacy decisions, meaning that data can flow freely between the EU and UK in both directions.
Australian Regulatory Environment
The Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act of 1988 (the “Privacy Act”) regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and security of personal information. Personal information is defined as “information or an opinion about 
an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not or is recorded in a material form or not”. Personal information includes location-based information where the information enables the location of an individual to be ascertained. Under the Privacy Act, before disclosing personal information outside of Australia, the transferor must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles in relation to the information. What constitutes reasonable steps will depend on the circumstances of the transfer, but would generally include entering into a transfer agreement between the transferor and the transferee under which the transferee agrees to handle the information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles. The transferor may be held responsible for any breaches of the Australian Privacy Principles when personal information is transferred outside Australia, regardless of whether there is a data transfer agreement in place. There are exceptions to the requirement to take reasonable steps, such as where the individual to whom the information relates provides fully informed consent.
The Notifiable Data Breach (“NDB”) scheme which was included in the Privacy Act in February 2018, requires companies to notify individuals whose personal information is involved in a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm and includes recommendations about steps individuals should take in response to the breach.
History and development of the Company

MiX Telematics Limited is a public company incorporated in the Republic of South Africa. Our principal executive office is located at 750 Park of Commerce Blvd., Suite 310, Boca Raton, Florida 33487. Our telephone number is +1-887-585-1088, and our web address is www.mixtelematics.com. We are regarded as being primary listed on the JSE and categorized as a domestic filer with regard to our American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) on the NYSE.
We were founded in 1996 in Johannesburg, South Africa as Matrix Vehicle Tracking Proprietary Limited, and since that time, we have grown both organically and through acquisitions. Matrix Vehicle Tracking Proprietary Limited was renamed TeliMatrix Proprietary Limited in 2001, TeliMatrix Limited in 2007 and finally MiX Telematics Limited in 2008, subsequent to our listing on the JSE.
In 2007, we acquired Control Instruments OmniBridge Proprietary Limited and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “OmniBridge”), which provided fleet management services in both the South African and international markets. In November 2007, we listed our shares on the JSE, in order to facilitate the OmniBridge acquisition. In 2008, we acquired Tripmaster Corporation, located in the United States, Safe Drive (including Safe Drive International Proprietary Limited), located in Australia and Safe Drive FZE, located in the United Arab Emirates. These acquisitions extended our geographic reach, broadened our customer relationships and expanded our driver safety and training solution offerings. In May 2012, we acquired Intellichain, located in South Africa, as part of our strategy to broaden our transportation management software functionality. On August 9, 2013, following a successful United States IPO, the Company’s ADSs were listed on the NYSE and are traded under the symbol MIXT. In December 2013, we acquired a proprietary software development business from Roitech Proprietary Limited, located in South Africa. The acquisition enhanced and broadened our fleet management smart phone application offerings. On November 1, 2014, we acquired the operating business of Compass Fleet Management (“Compass”), a South Africa based provider of specialized fleet management solutions in Southern Africa, that are delivered using the Company’s hardware and software platforms. These specialized fleet management solutions complement the Company’s existing fleet management solutions, and the acquisition broadens the array of services offered to current and future fleet management customers.
MiX Telematics North America, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Trimble’s Field Service Management business (“FSM”) in North America on September 2, 2022 (the “Transaction”). FSM’s North American operations include the sale and support of telemetry and video solutions that enable back-office monitoring and visualization for fleet services management in a number of industries. The Transaction presents an opportunity for the Company to increase its scale in North America and to further diversify its North America business by expanding its presence in market verticals such as construction and last mile logistics.
We currently have offices in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uganda, Brazil, Australia, Romania and the United Arab Emirates as well as a network of more than 130 fleet value-added resellers worldwide.
Our agent for service of process in the United States is MiX Telematics North America, Inc., 750 Park of Commerce Blvd., Suite 310, Boca Raton, Florida 33487.
