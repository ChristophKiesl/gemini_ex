Corporate History
 
American International Holdings Corp.
 
American International Holdings Corp. was organized in 1986 and is incorporated in Nevada. The Company has undergone several name changes and changes of control since its incorporation; however, from 2012 until April 2019, the Company had no operations and nominal assets.
 
Prior to May 31, 2018, the Company was a 93.2% owned subsidiary of American International Industries, Inc. (“American”, “AMIN”), a company whose securities are traded on the OTCQB market maintained by OTC Markets under the symbol “AMIN”.
 
Effective on May 31, 2018, the Company issued (a) 4,300,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Daniel Dror (the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and President (who resigned from such positions effective on May 31, 2018)); (b) 3,800,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Robert Holden (who was appointed President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company on May 31, 2018 and resigned on August 20, 2018); (c) 750,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Everett Bassie (who was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and a member of the board of directors of the Company on May 31, 2018, and who has since resigned from all positions with the Company); (d) 750,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Winfred Fields (a consultant to the Company); and (e) 500,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Charles R. Zeller (a then director of the Company), each in consideration for services rendered to the Company.
 
As a result of the issuance of the shares in May 2018 as discussed above, a change in control occurred. American International Industries, Inc. ownership decreased from 93.2% to 6.4%.
 
On April 12, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Novopelle Diamond, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Novopelle Diamond” and “Novopelle”) and certain unitholders of Novopelle Diamond. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Novopelle Diamond by means of a share exchange with the Novopelle Members in exchange for 18,000,000 newly issued shares of the common stock of the Company (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Novopelle became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company. The closing of the Share Exchange occurred concurrently with the entry into the Share Exchange Agreement and resulted in a change of control of the Company. As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company acquired the business of Novopelle Diamond and all of its assets. Novopelle Diamond is a physician supervised, medical spa and wellness clinic that offers a full menu of wellness services including anti-aging, weight loss and skin rejuvenation treatments.
 
The three unitholders of Novopelle Diamond who received shares pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement were (1) Jacob D. Cohen; (2) Esteban Alexander; and (3) Luis Alan Hernandez, who each received six million shares pursuant to the Share Exchange.
 
Concurrent with the Share Exchange, the Company entered into individual share exchange agreements and promissory notes with each of Daniel Dror, Winfred Fields and former directors Everett Bassie and Charles Zeller (the “AMIH Shareholders”) whereby the AMIH Shareholders agreed to cancel and exchange a total of 4,900,000 shares of their Company common stock for individual promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $350,000 (the “Promissory Notes”). The Promissory Notes had a term of two years and accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum (payable at maturity) until paid in full by the Company. The current principal balance of the Promissory Notes is approximately $110,000 as of the date of this filing.
 
As a result of the issuance of the shares in the Share Exchange and the cancellation of the shares held by the AMIH Shareholders, control of the Company changed to (1) Jacob D. Cohen; (2) Esteban Alexander; and (3) Alan Hernandez, who each owned 26% of the Company’s common stock following such transactions.
 
Also effective on April 12, 2019, the directors of the Company changed to Mr. Jacob D. Cohen; Mr. Esteban Alexander; and Mr. Alan Hernandez, who were also each appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company (Mr. Cohen); the Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer (Mr. Alexander); and the Chief Marketing Officer and Secretary (Mr. Hernandez). Mr. Bassie resigned as a member of the board of directors of the Company and as the Secretary and Treasurer on April 12, 2019, but remained as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer until his passing on May 21, 2020.

On October 2, 2020, Jacob D. Cohen, the Chief Executive Officer and member of the board of directors of the Company entered into Stock Purchase Agreements with each of (a) Esteban Alexander, the Chief Operating Officer and member of the board of directors of the Company, and (b) Luis Alan Hernandez, the Chief Marketing Officer and member of the board of directors of the Company (collectively, the “Preferred Holders” and the “Stock Purchase Agreements”).
 
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreements, Mr. Alexander agreed to sell 7,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company which he held to Mr. Cohen, which rights to such shares were assigned by Mr. Cohen to Cohen Enterprises, Inc., which entity he controls (“Cohen Enterprises”), in consideration for an aggregate of $1,500 as well as for the amount of services provided by Mr. Cohen to the Company; and Mr. Hernandez agreed to sell 4,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company which he held to Cohen Enterprises, in consideration for an aggregate of $1,000 as well as for the amount of services provided by Mr. Cohen to the Company. The sales closed on November 5, 2020.
 
One of the reasons that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez agreed to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreements (including the sale of the shares of common stock of the Company at below market value), is because (a) each of Mr. Cohen, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Hernandez were all appointed as officers and directors of the Company at the same time in April 2019, with the intention that such persons would provide a relatively equal amount of services to the Company in the roles as officers and directors thereof; (b) since such appointment date Mr. Cohen has been required to provide a disproportionate amount of services to the Company; and (c) each of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez desired to provide additional consideration to Mr. Cohen for such disproportionate level of service.
 
A condition to the Stock Purchase Agreements was that each of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez resign as a member of the board of directors of the Company by no later than January 15, 2021, which resignations were effective December 15, 2020.
 
A further requirement to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreements was that each of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez take such actions necessary and which may be requested from time to time by Mr. Cohen, to affect the cancellation of the one share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company held by each of them, for no consideration (including, but not limited to, without the required payment by the Company of the $1 redemption price described in the designation of such Series A Preferred Stock).
 
The shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by Mr. Alexander and Mr. Hernandez were canceled on November 6, 2020. The common shares were also transferred to Mr. Cohen on November 6, 2020, and as such, a change of control occurred on such date, with Mr. Cohen taking over voting control of the Company, and serving since December 15, 2020, as the sole officer and director of the Company.
 
The Company is headquartered in Addison, Texas and operates as a holding company dedicated to acquiring, managing and operating subsidiaries in (a) the health, wellness, and auxiliary industries across the United States and abroad; (b) general contracting and construction services; and (c) life coaching industry. The Company seeks opportunities to acquire and grow businesses that possess strong brand values and that can generate long-term sustainable free cash flow and attractive returns in order to maximize value for all stakeholders.
 
The Company currently is the parent to seven wholly-owned subsidiaries and one majority-owned subsidiary.

MEDICAL SPA AND WELLNESS
 
The Company currently owns three wholly-owned subsidiaries that were in the Medical Spa and Wellness Sector (collectively hereinafter referred to as “MedSpa”, or “VISSIA”), which MedSpas the Company discontinued operations in October 2020. They are:
1. VISSIA MCKINNEY, LLC (F/K/A NOVOPELLE DIAMOND, LLC) – 100% OWNED
 
As described above, on April 12, 2019, the Company entered into the Share Exchange Agreement with Novopelle and acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Novopelle Diamond by means of a share exchange with the Novopelle Members in exchange for 18,000,000 newly issued shares of the common stock of the Company. As a result of the Share Exchange, VISSIA McKinney became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company acquired the business of VISSIA McKinney and all of its assets. VISSIA McKinney is a physician supervised, medical spa and wellness clinic that offers a full menu of wellness services including anti-aging, weight loss and skin rejuvenation treatments located at 5000 Collin McKinney Parkway, Suite 150, McKinney, Texas 75070.
 
On June 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Novo MedSpa Addison Corporation (“NMAC”) granting the Company the exclusive rights to the Novopelle intellectual property, including copyrights and trademarks, proprietary technology, and other assets necessary or desirable to operate Novopelle branded MedSpa locations and the right to open additional Novopelle branded MedSpa locations. The agreement provides the Company with an exclusive worldwide, unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, and royalty-bearing license.
 
Upon the execution of the License Agreement, the Company made a one-time cash payment in the amount of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000) and issued to NMAC a one-time stock issuance of 250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. In addition, the Company has agreed to compensate NMAC with a one-time payment of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000) per new Novopelle location as established by the Company and provide NMAC with an ongoing royalty payment equal to six percent (6%) of the newly established location’s total gross monthly revenues.
 
On May 13, 2020, the Company provided NMAC with its notice to terminate the License Agreement in pursuit of the Company’s desire to establish and develop its own brand and have the flexibilities to offer additional products and services that are not currently available at Novopelle branded locations. As a result, on May 19, 2020, Novopelle Diamond, LLC was officially renamed to VISSIA McKinney, LLC. Effective on May 13, 2020 the License Agreement was terminated. The Company decided to discontinue operations in October 2020.
 
2. VISSIA WATERWAY, INC. (F/K/A NOVOPELLE WATERWAY, INC.) – 100% OWNED
 
On September 11, 2019, the Company formed and organized Novopelle Waterway, Inc., in the State of Texas to establish a Novopelle branded med spa located in the Waterway section of the Woodlands, Texas. As a result of the termination of the License Agreement with NMAC, Novopelle Waterway, Inc. was officially renamed to VISSIA Waterway, Inc. on May 19, 2020.
 
On November 6, 2019, VISSIA Waterway, Inc. entered into a Lease Agreement with 20 & 25 Waterway Holdings, LLC to lease and occupy approximately 1,254 square feet of commercial retail space located at 25 Waterway, Suite 150, The Woodlands, Texas and officially opened its doors for service at the end of February 2020. The Company decided to discontinue operations in October 2020.
 
3. NOVOPELLE TYLER, INC. – 100% OWNED
 
On December 3, 2019, the Company formed and organized Novopelle Tyler, Inc. in the State of Texas with the plan to come to terms on a retail location for a newly established Novopelle branded med spa to be located in Tyler, Texas.
 
On January 6, 2020, Novopelle Tyler, Inc. entered into a Lease Agreement with Asher Park, LLC to lease and occupy approximately 1,900 square feet of commercial retail space located in Tyler, Texas to operate a planned new Novopelle MedSpa location. As of the date of this Report, and due to issues and delays related to COVID-19, Novopelle Tyler has canceled the lease agreement in August 2020 as the current market and economic conditions continue to worsen due to unforeseen circumstances related to COVID-19. As such, Novopelle Tyler has not effectuated the name change to VISSIA with the State of Texas and no longer intends to open this location. No further activity has been performed under Novopelle Tyler to date and the Company decided to discontinue operations in October 2020.

As a result of COVID-19 and ‘stay-at-home’ and social distancing orders issued in McKinney and The Woodlands, Texas, we had to close both of our then operational MedSpas, VISSIA McKinney and VISSIA Waterway, Inc., which were closed effective March 10, 2020, and which resulted in both the loss of income and the loss of most of our workforce, who had to be let go. VISSIA Waterway, Inc. reopened effective June 21, 2020 and VISSIA McKinney reopened effective August 8, 2020. However, due to the termination of employees associated with the shutdown we were forced to expend resources to attract, hire and train completely new staff for preparation of the re-launchings. Notwithstanding the re-openings, customer traffic and demand at our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney MedSpa locations failed to rebound to pre-closure levels due to COVID-19 and the pandemic’s effects on the economy, and because we are unable to predict the length of the pandemic or ultimate outcome thereof, and further due to our limited capital resources, effective on October 25, 2020, we discontinued operations of both our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney locations. Our former MedSpa operations and assets are included under discontinued operations in the statement of operations and balance sheet included herein in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
 
VISSIA Service Offerings
 
Our VISSIA med spas were Texas based, physician-supervised medical spa & wellness clinics. When operational, VISSIA offered the following products and services:
 

● | Stem Cell Therapy | ● | Acne & Acne Scar Reduction 
--+---------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------
● | Laser Hair Removal | ● | Testosterone Replacement Therapy 
● | PRP Facial (Vampire Facial) | ● | Hair Restoration 
● | Novo Lipo (Body Contouring) | ● | Botox & Fillers

Medical Spa Marketing Strategy
 
When operational, VISSIA marketed its products and services to both men and women that are conscience about fitness, health, wellness and aesthetics.
 
When operational, VISSIA deployed unique, proven marketing strategies through social media with both sponsored and paid advertisements as well as the use of local brand ambassadors and influencers. VISSIA experienced a lot of success by placing marketing materials in nearby retail establishments and utilizing cross marketing relationships with other vendors and retailers that market to similar demographics.
Competition
 
The health, wellness, fashion and medical spa industries are highly competitive with new locations, brands and facilities being established on a frequent basis. The industries continue to expand and evolve as an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we have. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than we have in the development of health and wellness services and products. In addition, our services and products compete with service and product offerings from large and well-established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than we or our collaboration partners have.

Specifically, and as it relates to medical spas, there are both many independently operated locations as well as doctor’s offices that provide some or all of the services that we provide. At the same time, the demand and the number of individuals – both men and women – that are seeking medical spas for a variety of health, wellness and cosmetic/aesthetic type treatments and solutions has increased dramatically over the past several years. With medical spa treatments, such as laser hair removal and Botox injections, becoming more available, desirable, and affordable, demand for these services has dramatically increased.
 
CAPITOL CITY SOLUTIONS, USA, INC. – 100% OWNED
 
On September 17, 2019, the Company formed and organized Capitol City Solutions USA, Inc. (“CCS”) in the State of Texas to act as a general contracting and construction company focused on the remodeling, general construction and interior finish of both the Company’s newly established med spa locations as well as to market to other commercial real estate projects within the United States.
Service Offerings
 
CCS currently offers a variety of general contracting services to oversee the entirety of commercial construction projects and manage all phases of construction. These areas can range from permitting, roofing and exterior construction or remodeling, to interior finish out, including but not limited to cabinetry, drywall, plumbing and electrical. CCS primarily utilizes the services of its sub-contractors in order to perform its services and in some instances will perform various construction related tasks with its own work force in order to improve its project specific margins and profitability.
Marketing Strategy
 
CCS has primarily relied on word of mouth and existing relationships in order to market and secure its services and obtain access to viable projects. Additional strategies include the utilization of search engine optimization (SEO) marketing on its website at www.capitolcitysolutionsusa.com (which includes information the Company does not desire to incorporate by reference into this Report) and other social media outlets to reach out to both commercial developers and multi-family property owners and developers to solicit additional projects. Due to its current resources, CCS is currently limiting its marketing initiatives for projects located within the State of Texas.
Competition
 
The general contracting and construction industry is highly competitive with many larger, more established construction companies vying and marketing for the same projects as CCS. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial, technical and development resources and experience than we have. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than we have in all aspects of construction from both a new construction development and commercial remodeling.
LEGEND NUTRITION, INC. – 100% OWNED
 
On September 23, 2019, the Company formed and organized Legend Nutrition, Inc. (“Legend Nutrition”) in the State of Texas to act as a new brand of retail vitamin and supplement stores to be branded and marketed as Legend Nutrition.
 
October 18, 2019, Legend entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the assets associated with and related to a retail vitamin, supplements and nutrition store located in McKinney, Texas and previously identified and doing business as “Ideal Nutrition.” Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Legend purchased a variety of assets including software, contracts, bank and merchant accounts, products, inventory, computers, security systems and other intellectual properties.
 
Product and Service Offerings
 
Legend Nutrition operated a 1,500 square foot retail store offering a variety of vitamin & nutritional supplements as well as nutritional and weight loss plans through a consultative approach with each and every customer. Legend Nutrition’s products include, but are not limited to, a variety of workout related supplements such as vitamins, protein powders, pre-workout powders, and post-workout supplements that focus on muscle and overall health recovery. Legend Nutrition was located at 2851 Craig Drive, Suite #204, McKinney, TX 75070.

Legend Nutrition sold, marketed and catered to an audience of health conscience and minded individuals including, but not limited to, athletes, sports enthusiasts and bodybuilders. Legend Nutrition deployed a number of marketing strategies in order to attract local customers to its retail store. The most effective marketing strategy was the use of promotional marketing materials, such as Legend Nutrition branded t-shirts, which were distributed to its customers free of charge. Customers would wear these t-shirts when they work out at their local gym and were encouraged to post pictures and tag Legend Nutrition on various social media applications. Legend Nutrition also set up displays at local gyms and other local retail establishments to promote its various products and services.
 
The MedSpas were forced to close during the second and third quarters of 2020, and the Company discontinued such operations during the fourth quarter of 2020. Legend Nutrition was able to remain open as an essential business as we sold vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Though the store was able to remain open, the store saw a deep decline in sales due to social distancing orders and decreases in customers who are willing to venture out to brick and mortar establishments. Legend Nutrition’s lease was up January 31, 2021, and the Company chose not to renew the lease, closed the store, and will not continue in this line of business moving forward. Our former Legend Nutrition operations and assets are included under discontinued operations in the statement of operations and balance sheet included herein in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
 
LIFE GURU, INC. – 51% OWNED
 
On May 15, 2020, the Company acquired a 51% interest in Life Guru, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Life Guru owns the website www.LifeGuru.me – a website dedicated to providing an online platform to connect consumers to a variety of mentors, professionals, life coaches and career coaches (which includes information the Company does not desire to incorporate by reference into this Report). The LifeGuru.me website is currently in development and is anticipated to be fully launched on or before March 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had an impairment loss of $670,488 primarily attributable to the investment in LifeGuru, which was impaired due to limited activities to date and uncertain future cash flows.
ZIPDOCTOR, INC. – 100% OWNED
 
On April 28, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, ZipDoctor, Inc. (“ZipDoctor”) in the State of Texas. ZipDoctor plans to provide its customers with unlimited, 24/7 access to board certified physicians and licensed mental and behavioral health counselors and therapists via a newly developed, monthly subscription based online telemedicine platform. ZipDoctor’s online telemedicine platform is available to customers across the United States and offers bilingual coverage (both English and Spanish), with virtual visits taking place either via the phone or through a secured video chat platform. ZipDoctor customers subscribe through the website and are only required to pay a low monthly fee, which is determined based on if they are an individual, a couple, or a family. ZipDoctor is currently being sold on a direct-to-consumer basis with an emphasis on digital marketing and advertising. The Company intends to shift the business model to focus on offering ZipDoctor’s services to small to medium size companies to provide its telemedicine services to their employees as an employment health benefit. The Company launched the platform in the third quarter of 2020 and has generated nominal revenues to date.
EPIQ MD, INC. – 100% OWNED
 
On October 23, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, EPIQ MD, Inc. (“EPIQ MD”) in the State of Nevada. EPIQ MD is planned to be a direct to consumer, telemedicine and healthcare company targeting the over approximately 76 million Americans who are uninsured or underinsured; this includes, but is not limited to the working class, middle income and upper middle-income demographics. The EPIQ MD service offering is planned to be a convergence of primary care telemedicine, preventative care services and wellness programs – under one brand and on one platform. The EPIQ MD services are planned to be sold directly to consumers using a direct sales model and utilizing brand ambassadors. EPIQ MD is currently in development mode and anticipates a soft launch in the 2nd quarter of 2021.

The Company intends to continue to grow its business both organically and through identifying acquisition targets over the next 12 months in the telemedicine, life coaching, and wellness space. As these opportunities arise, the Company will determine the best method for financing its growth which may include the issuance of additional debt instruments, common stock, preferred stock, or a combination thereof, any one or more of which may cause significant dilution to existing shareholders.
 
Organizational Structure
 

Recent Events:
 
On January 6, 2021 (the “First Closing Date”), we closed the transactions contemplated by a Securities Purchase Agreement dated January 6, 2021 (the “Purchase Agreement”), which was entered into with a group of accredited institutional investors (collectively, the “Investors”), for the sale of convertible promissory notes.
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell 6% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,450,000 (the “Notes”) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Warrants”) to the Investors and entered into a Security Agreement, a Guaranty Agreement, a Pledge Agreement, and a Registration Rights Agreement (the foregoing, collectively with the Purchase Agreement, Notes and Warrant, the “Transaction Documents”). The Purchase Agreement includes indemnification obligations of the Company, requirements for the Company to reserve three times the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants, the right of the Investors to participate up to 30% in any future equity or debt offering made by the Company in the 12 months after the First Closing Date, a prohibition on the Company selling any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents until 30 days after the First Closing Date, subject to certain exceptions, a one year prohibition on the Company entering into any equity line transaction or variable rate transaction (including convertible notes with adjustable conversion prices), and a one year prohibition, without the approval of the Investors, of a reverse or forward stock split.
 
A total of $850,000 in Notes (the “First Tranche Notes”) were sold on the First Closing Date, and a total of $600,000 in Notes (the “Second Tranche Notes”), were sold on March 30, 2021 (the “Second Closing Date”). In connection with the sale of the First Tranche Notes, the Company paid $25,000 of the Investors’ legal fees and certain other amounts in expense reimbursements.
 
Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc. acted as the placement agent for the Notes and the Company paid Network 1 Financial Services, Inc. a total of $51,000 in placement fees in connection with the sale of the First Tranche Notes and $36,000 in placement fees in connection with the sale of the Second Tranche Notes.
 
The Company plans to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay existing variable priced convertible promissory notes and for general working capital.
 
The First Tranche Notes mature on January 7, 2022 and the Second Tranche Notes mature on March 30, 2022, and accrue interest at a rate of 6% per annum (15% upon the occurrence of an event of default) payable to the Investors in cash on a calendar quarterly basis (which changes to monthly upon the occurrence of an event of default). Each of the Notes contained a 6% original issue discount.
 

11
--


The First Tranche Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at any time, at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) $0.50 per share and (ii) 75% of the lowest daily volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company’s common stock during the seven consecutive trading days prior to the delivery of a conversion notice (the “Market Price”), but not less than 75% of the VWAP on the First Closing Date. The Second Tranche Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a rate equal to the lesser of (1) the VWAP on the Second Closing date ($0.2437) or (2) the Market Price, but not less than 75% of the VWAP on the Second Tranche closing date. However, if while any Notes are outstanding and the daily VWAP on any of seven consecutive trading days is less than the applicable floor price(s), such floor price(s) are reduced (but not increased) to 75% of the VWAP on the seventh trading day.
 
The conversion price of the Notes may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events and the Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the Investors in the event the Company defaults on any terms of the Notes or the other Transaction Documents. Additionally, at the option of the Investors, upon the occurrence of any event of default, the Investors can elect to convert the Notes at the lower of the stated conversion price and a conversion price equal to 70% of the lowest closing bid price of the common stock during the 10 consecutive trading day period ending and including the date of delivery or deemed delivery of any applicable conversion notice (the “Alternative Conversion Price”). The Notes contain penalties for the Company’s failure to timely deliver shares due upon conversion thereof. The Notes contain provisions limiting each Investor’s ability to convert any portion of its individual Note if such conversion would cause the Investor’s (or any affiliate of any such Investor) holdings in the Company to exceed 9.99% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Notes contain customary events of default, which include any default of $30,000 of more of indebtedness of the Company, final judgements equal to or greater than $75,000 rendered against the Company, and the Company’s failure to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, at the option of the holder thereof, the amount of the Note increases by 110% (including principal and accrued interest) (plus 2% additional for each event of default that occurs thereafter). The Notes contain certain rights of the holders thereof upon the occurrence of a change of control or fundamental transaction, each as described in greater detail therein.
 
The Warrants are exercisable at various prices with (i) Warrants to purchase 2,250,000 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.20 per share, (ii) Warrants to purchase 2,250,000 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.35 per share, and (iii) Warrants to purchase 2,250,000 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.50 per share. All of the Warrants may be exercised via cashless exercise in the event that the shares underlying the Warrants are not registered within 180 days of the closing of the transaction. The Warrants, if not exercised by such date, terminate on January 7, 2026. The Warrants contain provisions limiting each Investor’s ability to exercise the Warrants if such exercise would cause the Investor’s (or any affiliate of any such Investor) holdings in the Company to exceed 9.99% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. We may prepay the Notes (provided we treat all Note holders equally) by paying 110% of the principal and interest thereon at any time (provided we are required to provide the holders 15 days prior written notice of such repayment, and during which time period the holder may convert the Note into common stock). Unless the Company’s common stock is listed on the NYSE, the NYSE American, the Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq Global Market or Nasdaq Global Select, at any time the Company issues common stock or common stock equivalents, subject to certain exceptions, below the then exercise price, the exercise price of the Warrants reset to the lower of such dilutive issuance or the VWAP on the next trading day following the first public disclosure of such dilutive issuance. Upon an event of default, the exercise price of the Warrants, at the option of the Investors, is the Alternative Conversion Price. If the Company undertakes a fundamental transaction and the successor entity is not a publicly-traded company, the holders of the Warrants have the right to require the Company to pay the greater of (a) the Black Scholes Value of the warrants; and (b) the positive difference between the consideration payable in such fundamental transaction minus the exercise price.
 
Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Company and each of its subsidiaries provided the Investors a first priority security interest in substantially all of their assets to secure the repayment of the Notes.
 
The Subsidiary Guaranty, signed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries, provides for joint and several guaranties of the obligations set forth in the Notes by each of the Company’s subsidiaries. Each future subsidiary of the Company is required to enter into a joinder to the agreement as well.

In connection with the Registration Rights Agreement, we provided the Investors registration rights in connection with the Notes and Warrants, and agreed to (1) file a Registration Statement on Form S-1 within 21 days after the First Closing Date to register the common stock to be acquired by the Investors pursuant to the conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants and any other shares of common stock subsequently acquired by the Investors, which was timely filed, and has been declared effective, and granted the Investors piggy-back registration rights. We also agreed to indemnify the Investors in connection with any liability in connection with the registration of such securities.
 
The Transaction Documents contain other representations, warranties, covenants and restrictions common with this type of transaction, including but not limited to, most favored nations provisions (which apply to the conversion price of the Notes, the terms of the Notes and the terms of the Warrants) and future participation clauses, and prohibitions on further borrowing.
 
On March 8, 2021, we entered into a Consulting Agreement with KBHS, LLC (“KBHS”), whose Chief Executive Officer is Mr. Kevin Harrington, who was appointed as the sole member of our newly formed Advisory Committee.
 
Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, KBHS agreed to provide consulting services to the Company as the Company’s Brand Ambassador, including providing endorsement services and advising on marketing, promotions, acquisitions, licensing and business development. KBHS also agreed to up to four webinar appearances on behalf of the Company per year to support the Company’s direct sales efforts. The Consulting Agreement has a term of two years, and can be terminated with ten days prior written notice (subject to applicable cure rights set forth in the Consulting Agreement), in the event we or KBHS breach any term of the agreement, or we fail to pay any amounts due, become subject to any government regulatory investigation, certain lawsuits, claims, actions or take certain other actions during the term of the Consulting Agreement.
 
As consideration for providing the services under the Consulting Agreement, we agreed to issue KBHS 1.5 million shares of restricted common stock, which vest immediately upon issuance, to pay KBHS $10,000 per month, and agreed to pay KBHS a 5% finder’s fee on any new business introduced or developed by KBHS and 7.5% of the value of any acquisition or merger created or developed exclusively by KBHS, undertaken by the Company, subject to applicable laws. In the event we fail to pay any consideration due under the Consulting Agreement, such amount accrues interest at the rate of 1.5% per month until paid in full.
 
COVID-19 Outlook
 
The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the related responses by public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat its outbreak and spread has severely impacted the U.S. and world economies, the market for health spa services, nutrition supplements and our other business offerings during the end of the first quarter of 2020, and continuing through the end of 2020, and into 2021. Government mandated ‘stay-at-home’ and similar orders have to date, and may in the future, prevent us from staffing our spas and construction services, and prohibit us from operating altogether. As discussed above, we made the decision to discontinue operations of our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney locations.
 
Additionally, our Legend Nutrition store saw a deep decline in sales due to social distancing orders and decreases in customers who are willing to venture out to brick and mortar establishments. Legend Nutrition’s lease was up January 31, 2021, and the Company chose not to renew the lease, closed the store, and will not continue in this line of business moving forward.

We currently anticipate experiencing ongoing disruptions to our ability to reopen our medical spas and provide construction services, and provide future planned telehealth services and overall declines in the demand for our other offerings throughout the first half of 2021, at a minimum, as Texas, and the U.S. in general, continues to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and rollout vaccines. Any prolonged disruption to our operations, work force available, is likely to have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to meet continuing debt service requirements. We have also experienced delays in completing construction projects due to the effects of COVID-19.
