Item 1.    Business
Overview
Wayfair is one of the world's largest online destinations for the home. Through our e-commerce business model, we offer visually inspired browsing, compelling merchandising, easy product discovery and attractive prices for over eight million products from over 10,000 suppliers. 
The target Wayfair customer is a 35- to 65-year-old woman with an annual household income of $50,000 to $250,000, who we consider to be a mass-market consumer and who we believe is underserved by traditional brick and mortar and other online retailers of home goods. Because each of our customers has a different taste, style, purchasing goal, and budget when shopping for her home, we have built one of the largest online selections of furniture, décor, decorative accents, housewares, seasonal decor, and other home goods. We are able to offer this vast selection of products because we hold minimal inventory. Products are shipped to our customers directly from our suppliers, or increasingly from our CastleGate fulfillment network, "CastleGate." Our CastleGate solution enables our suppliers to forward-position their inventory, allowing faster delivery to the customer with lower rates of damage and lowering our cost per order over time. We believe providing superior customer service is key to delighting our customer, and our customer service locations are staffed with approximately 1,400 highly-trained sales and service employees located in the United States of America ("U.S.") and Europe. 
We founded our company in May 2002. From 2002 through 2011, the Company was bootstrapped by our co-founders and operated as hundreds of niche websites, such as bedroomfurniture.com and allbarstools.com. In late 2011, we made the strategic decision to close and permanently redirect over 240 of our niche websites into Wayfair.com to create a one-stop shop for furniture, décor and home goods and to build brand awareness, drive customer loyalty and increase repeat purchasing. From 2012 to 2016, our aided brand awareness in the U.S. grew from 6% to 77%. Over the last few years, we have invested in expanding our international business in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany by building our international infrastructure, growing our international supplier networks, and establishing our brand presence in select countries.
Our co-founders are lifetime tech innovators who have worked together in the commercial internet sector since 1995. As engineers themselves, they have created a company culture deeply rooted in technology and data. Their significant equity ownership in Wayfair has informed their leadership and allowed them to take a long-term view when building our company. 
Segments 
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, Wayfair changed its operating and reportable segments from one segment to two operating and reportable segments, U.S. and International. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment and Geographic Information, included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While Wayfair manages its business through the two segments, net revenue of the U.S. segment represented 92% of consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Our Industry
The home goods market is large and characterized by specific consumer trends, structural challenges and market dynamics that are shaping the future of our industry.
Addressable Market Size and Growth
We believe the annual U.S. market for home goods is approximately $270 billion, of which approximately 9% is sold online today. We believe the mass market for home goods represents the largest addressable opportunity within the home goods sector and that the mass market consumer is under-served due to structural limitations of brick and mortar and other online retailers. According to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 65 million households in the U.S. with annual incomes between $50,000 and $250,000. Moreover, we believe there are approximately 70 million millennials (which we define as individuals currently between the ages of 21 to 34) in the U.S., many of whom are accustomed to purchasing goods online. As millennials age, start new families and move into new homes, we expect online sales of home goods to increase. In addition, we believe the online home goods market will further grow as older generations of consumers become increasingly comfortable purchasing online. With our more recent entry into Canada and western Europe, we believe we have more than doubled the size of our total addressable market.

Why Home is Different
Home is Shopped Differently than Other Retail Verticals: Homes are personal expressions of self and identity, which is why many consumers seek uniqueness, crave originality and enjoy the feeling created by home design, furniture and décor. Consumers shopping for home goods often cannot articulate what they are looking for other than to describe a feeling or visual image that they want to capture in their home. In addition, while consumers typically know the names of big box and specialty retailers that offer various home products, we believe they rarely know the names of the product brands or suppliers. We believe traditional search-based sites that rely on directed product search (e.g., "running sneakers") or brand name search (e.g., "Samsung 32-inch LCD television") have difficulty serving customers shopping for home products in this more emotional, visual and inspirational manner.
Home Shoppers Desire Uniqueness, which Requires Vast Selection: In the mass market for home goods, consumers with different tastes, styles, purchasing goals and budgets require a broad selection of products and choices. This need for selection applies across many home categories, including furniture, décor, lighting, kitchen, bed & bath, outdoor, home improvement and baby & kids, each of which has dozens of sub-categories with thousands to tens of thousands of products. Brick and mortar home goods retailers must balance a consumer's desire for uniqueness, which requires massive selection, with the challenges of high inventory carrying costs and limited showroom and storage space.
Time Consuming and Inconvenient for Consumers to Shop across Brick and Mortar Home Retailers: To browse a vast selection of products across highly-fragmented brick and mortar retailers, consumers must shop multiple stores. For example, if a nearby furniture retailer has 20 bedroom sets on its showroom floor, a consumer may feel she must visit multiple stores to see a wide enough selection to make an informed purchase decision that satisfies her style and budget needs. We believe the lack of an easy-to-browse, one-stop shopping experience with massive selection has led to dissatisfaction with brick and mortar home goods shopping. In contrast, Wayfair.com offers over 2,400 bedroom sets across many styles and prices, which mitigates the need for a consumer to visit multiple stores to find the perfect item at a price she can afford.
Challenging Logistics for Retailers and Consumers: Logistics, fulfillment and customer service for home goods products are challenging given the variety of categories and price points and the mix of heavy and bulky items. Home goods often have a low dollar value to weight ratio compared to other categories of retail, therefore requiring a logistics network that is optimized for items with those characteristics. Many consumers also seek first-rate customer service so they are not burdened with managing delivery, shipping and return logistics on their own. However, we believe big box retailers that serve the mass market for home goods are often unable or unwilling to provide this level of service. In addition, many regional retailers do not ship nationally, which we believe is because they lack the required scalable technology, operations and distribution infrastructure.

Key Benefits for Our Suppliers
Through our technology platform, we offer our suppliers a cost-effective channel, the ability to leverage our technological expertise, a real-time view of our demand and proven logistics capabilities to help sell their products.
Cost-Effective Access to Our Large Customer Base: We sell products from over 10,000 suppliers, many of which are small, family-run operations without well-known product brands and without easy retail access to a large customer base. We provide our suppliers with access to our customer base of 8.3 million active customers, enabling them to increase their sales and access the growing e-commerce market.
Ability to Leverage Our Technological Expertise to Drive Sales: Our technology platform is designed to allow suppliers to easily provide us with their full product selection. Through our technology platform, we believe many of our suppliers have increased their sales, which has strengthened their loyalty to us.
Real-Time View of Demand and Inventory Needs via Data and Analytics: We offer our suppliers a real-time view of our demand and inventory needs via powerful data and analytics.
Proven Logistics Capabilities: Our logistics infrastructure allows us to ship directly to our customers from our suppliers or from our CastleGate warehouses. This fulfillment network is a key component of our custom-built and seamlessly integrated technology and operational platform.
Sites and Brands 
Each of our customers has a different taste, style, purchasing goal and budget when shopping for her home. To help her find the right products for her home, we offer five distinct sites, including websites, mobile-optimized websites and mobile applications (collectively "sites"): Wayfair, which represents a significant majority of our revenue, Joss & Main, AllModern, DwellStudio and Birch Lane. Each site has a unique brand identity that offers a tailored shopping experience and rich product selection to a different target audience.
Wayfair: an online destination for all things home
Joss & Main: where beautiful furniture and finds meet irresistible savings 
AllModern: your home for affordable modern design 
DwellStudio: a design house with a decidedly modern vibe
Birch Lane: a collection of classic furnishings and timeless home décor
Wayfair is the only one of our sites that also operates internationally, operating as Wayfair.ca in Canada, Wayfair.co.uk in the United Kingdom and Wayfair.de in Germany.
On our sites, we also feature certain products under our house brands, such as Three PostsTM and Mercury RowTM. Through these house brands, we help our customers navigate our sites to find items quickly that match her particular style and price point. 
"Direct Retail" sales include net revenue generated through the five distinct sites described above. In additional to Direct Retail, we also generate "Other" net revenue through the following sources:
Retail Partners: A portion of our net revenue is generated from sites operated by third parties. These relationships allow consumers to purchase Wayfair products through the retail partners' sites. We made the strategic decision starting in 2014 to deemphasize this part of our business. 
Wayfair Media Solutions: A smaller portion of our net revenue is generated through third-party advertisers that pay for advertisements placed on our sites. Wayfair helps selected manufacturers, retailers and other advertisers market to our large consumer audience.

Technology
We have custom-built our proprietary technology and operational platform to deliver the best experience for both our customers and suppliers. Our success has been built on a culture of data-driven decision-making, operational discipline and an unwavering focus on the customer. We employ over 1,000 engineers and data scientists and believe we are able to attract and retain some of the best technological minds. We believe that control of our technology systems and the ability to update them often is a competitive advantage. 
Our engineering team has built a full set of technology solutions specific for the home goods market, including:
Storefront: A large set of tools and systems with which our customers directly interact. Our team develops an experience specifically tuned for shopping the home goods category by mixing lifestyle imagery and design inspiration with easy-to-use navigation tools and personalization features designed to increase customer conversion.
Operations: A majority of the software we have written is designed to deliver the reliable and consistent experience consumers desire, but is not consumer facing. Examples of the areas of our business that are powered by our proprietary software include our technology integrations with our suppliers, our warehouse and logistics network and our customer service centers. 
Advertising Technology: Much of our advertising technology was internally developed, including campaign management and bidding algorithms for online advertising. This allows us to leverage our internal data and target customers efficiently across various channels. We also partner selectively with marketing partners where we find solutions that meet our marketing objectives and deliver strong return on investment. 
Much of the underlying infrastructure for storefront, operations and advertising technology is common across all of our sites and countries. Our systems are managed in three geographically distributed, highly secure data centers and are engineered for high availability. These systems are monitored 24x7 by our network operations center for performance and security.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts bring new and repeat customers to our sites and help us acquire their email addresses through various paid and non-paid advertising methods. Our paid advertising efforts consist primarily of online channels, including search engine marketing, display advertising, and paid social media, and to a lesser extent catalog and television advertisements. Our non-paid advertising efforts include search engine optimization, non-paid social media, mobile "push" notifications and email. Upon acquiring a customer or a potential customer's email address, we seek to increase their engagement with our sites and drive repeat purchases. This effort to increase engagement and repeat purchasing is driven by all of our marketing tools, including email marketing efforts and customer retargeting. We rigorously manage our paid marketing efforts towards the goal that each new spending initiative is cost-effective with a measurable return on investment within a short period of time.
Logistics
Our logistics network was built specifically for the home category, where items can be bulky, heavy and prone to damage. Historically, our primary method of fulfillment was a drop-ship network where integration into our suppliers' back-end technology infrastructure allowed us to process an order and send it directly to a supplier's warehouse. We would then arrange for shipment from the loading dock of the supplier's warehouse to the customer's home. Depending on the size of the package, the delivery would be made either through carriers such as FedEx or UPS or third party line haul trucking companies and third party last mile home delivery agents. In addition to this drop-ship network, we now also operate our own CastleGate warehouses and our own Wayfair Delivery Network ("WDN"), including consolidation centers and cross dock facilities, line haul, and last mile home delivery locations to increase delivery speed to customers, reduce damage rates, and enable a higher quality delivery experience for our customers. 
Customer Service
Our customer service team consists of approximately 1,400 Wayfair sales and service consultants and employees located in five locations across the U.S. and two locations in Europe who are available to help our customers with sales and service via phone, email or online chat. Because we view superior customer service as one of our key values, our sales and service employees receive extensive training as well as competitive compensation and benefit packages. The team consists of generalists as well as specialists who have deeper expertise and training in select areas of our catalog, such as lighting, flooring and upholstery.

Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to further improve our leadership in the home goods market by pursuing the following key strategies:

• | continue building our leading retail home brands by delighting our customers;


• | acquire new customers and increase repeat purchases from existing customers;


• | invest in technology to further improve our customer experiences;


• | grow certain categories where we under index the broader home goods market today, such as home improvement (e.g. plumbing, lighting and flooring), housewares, seasonal decor and decorative accents;


• | increase delivery speed and lower damage rates through the continued build-out of our proprietary logistics network;


• | continue to expand internationally; and


• | opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions.

Competition
The market for online home goods and furniture is highly competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. While we are primarily focused on the mass market, we compete across all segments of the home goods market. Our competition includes furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores, specialty retailers and online retailers and marketplaces in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany, including:

• | Furniture Stores: Ashley Furniture, At Home, Bob's Discount Furniture, Havertys, Raymour & Flanigan, Rooms To Go;


• | Big Box Retailers: Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, IKEA, Lowe's, Target and Walmart;


• | Department Stores: JCPenney and Macy's;


• | Specialty Retailers: Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, HomeGoods, Pottery Barn and Restoration Hardware;


• | Online Retailers and Marketplaces: Amazon and eBay; and


• | International: Leon's, Canadian Tire, John Lewis, WorldStores, Otto and Home24, in addition to several of the companies listed above who also compete with us internationally.

We believe that the primary competitive factors in the mass market are vast selection, visually inspiring browsing, compelling merchandising, ease of product discovery, price, convenience, reliability, speed of fulfillment and customer service. We believe our technological and operational expertise allows us to provide our customers with a vast selection of goods, attractive price points, reliable and timely fulfillment, plus superior customer service, and that the combination of these capabilities is what provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 5,637 full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, we rely on independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce, primarily in our fulfillment centers. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property, including any trademarks, copyrights, domain names, patents, trade dress, trade secrets and proprietary technologies, is an important part of our business. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions. We pursue the registration of our trademarks, including "Wayfair" and certain variations thereon, copyrights and domain names in the U.S. and certain foreign locations. We also rely on the protection of laws regarding unregistered copyrights for our proprietary software and certain other content we create. We will continue to evaluate the merits applying for copyright registrations in the future. We have an issued patent regarding our proprietary technology and we are evaluating additional patent applications. We expect to consider filing patent applications for future technology inventions. We also rely on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. To further protect our intellectual property, we enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention assignment agreements with employees and certain contractors and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, such as suppliers.
