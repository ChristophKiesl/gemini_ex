Overview
Ping Identity’s mission is to secure the digital world through intelligent identity. We deliver on this mission by providing intelligent identity solutions for the enterprise, leveraging artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) to provide real-time authentication. We enable companies to achieve zero trust security by making identity frictionless, giving our customer the ability to go faster, get to the cloud and reduce costs, all while improving their end-user experiences.
​
We solve big problems for the world’s largest enterprises. We serve more than half of the Fortune 100, and we have partnerships with companies such as Microsoft and Amazon. We serve a broad range of vertical markets with particular strength in financial services, healthcare, technology, aerospace, and retail, especially among the Global 5000. 
​
Ping Identity’s platform enables a range of use cases for workforces, for partners, and for a wide variety of consumer-facing applications. Our solutions and solution packages can be deployed as software-as-a-service (“SaaS”), as on premises software, or as hybrid. We also provide flexibility to deploy our SaaS solutions in Ping Identity’s cloud, the customer’s private cloud, or in a public cloud. We have consistently been recognized as a leader in the Identity and Access Management (“IAM”) industry by Gartner and other analysts. For example, Gartner’s Magic Quadrant research on access management has named Ping Identity a leader for the last five years. Other analysts that have named Ping Identity a leader in 2021 include KuppingerCole, ISG and Quadrant Knowledge Solutions for reports covering identity solutions for Customers, Workforce, and Internet of Things (“IoT”).
​
Our Growth Strategy
Ping Identity solutions live in a world that is increasingly borderless – both geographically and virtually. Enterprises are undergoing an acceleration of their digital transformation initiatives as they seek to adapt to work-from-home realities, create new revenue streams, transition to new digital business models and increase customer engagement. This transformation creates vast distribution requirements extending well beyond the traditional network security perimeter. These requirements create business opportunities with a potential market that management estimates at $50 billion, based on our internal analysis. We quantify our market opportunity by identifying the total number of global companies above $500 million in annual revenue as identified by D&B Hoovers and segmenting these companies into four revenue bands. We then multiply the number of companies within each revenue band by our internal Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) data for that revenue band, assuming deployment of all our solutions and use cases at each of the companies, and apply an estimated market growth rate. For the definition of ARR and a description of how we calculate this metric, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
​
Growth in the IAM market is driven by several factors: 
​

● | governmental and private-sector cybersecurity mandates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | increasingly complex regulatory and compliance requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | demand for better user experiences;
--+------------------------------------


● | escalating privacy concerns; and
--+---------------------------------


● | the need to have secure connections anywhere, anytime, agnostic to geographic location.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In order to address opportunities in the IAM market, we have focused our growth strategy on five core themes:
​

● | Ongoing movement to cloud and SaaS. Companies are increasingly adopting IAM solutions in the cloud to support their hybrid application portfolios. These solutions often utilize our SaaS-based
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

solutions in combination with deployments of our platform in their public or private clouds of choice to address a broad range of requirements. Our SaaS revenue increased by 51% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. We see these trends continuing as we move forward.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Greater uptake in our customer-based use cases driven by consumer demand. While we continue to see strong adoption of our workforce solutions, increasingly enterprises are turning to Ping to solve problems for their consumer-facing solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2021,the proportion of ARR from customer use cases relative to workforce use cases was greater than 55%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | A go-to-market effort that will put an emphasis not only on direct sales but, increasingly, on leverage through the channel. Historically, our go-to-market effort has focused more exclusively on direct sales, but increasingly, we are engaging channel and integration partners to extend our reach. With that as a focus, in 2021 we put emphasis on partner certifications, and now have more than 184 partners certified to sell our solutions and 363 partners certified to install and integrate them for our customers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | A continued pace of product introductions, allowing further penetration of our existing customer base. We have expanded our suite of services from six to twelve solutions over the last three years. As of December 31, 2021, 52% of customers leveraged at least two Ping Identity solutions, with 26% using three or more. Our net retention rate increased from 108% as of December 31, 2020 to 112% as of December 31, 2021, driven primarily by additional sales into our existing customer base and an increase in customers electing to execute larger contracts in response to the strengthening economic outlook and easing of COVID-19 restrictions in certain markets. For the definition of net retention rate and a description of how we calculate this metric, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Entry into new markets. We continue to build our market presence, both domestically and internationally. In the current year, we added a new Chief Revenue Officer who brought significant international expertise. We also continued to expand our sales team, allowing further penetration into the Global 5000 and beyond. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our international revenue was 26% of our total revenue, up more than 20% from the year ended December 31, 2020. We have also added a team dedicated to building our footprint with the U.S. federal government, working through our reseller and distribution partners. In 2021, we received our FedRAMP sponsorship from the Department of Energy, and as such, expect to make our PingOne for Government service broadly available in 2022.

Our Solutions and Solution Packages
Ping Identity’s platform consists of multiple solutions across the identity life cycle that can be purchased individually or as a set of integrated solutions for the customer, workforce, partner or IoT use case. Our modular design allows customers to easily integrate with existing applications and infrastructures and does not require an all-or-nothing rip and replace. Enterprises have long relied on rigid IT infrastructure, which over time can become cemented into hundreds of applications, making it unwieldy to manage. Ping Identity untangles the customized infrastructure through its flexible services and solutions, creating a seamless fabric of security that resides underneath users and their devices. Ping Identity envisions a world where zero trust is foundational, where everyone – and every device – is strongly authenticated and appropriately authorized.

Single Sign-On. (“SSO”) Our SSO solution allows users to sign on using one set of secure credentials, giving them one-click access to their applications and resources regardless of location. Our SSO solution provides turnkey integrations for a wide range of applications, cloud services, IT infrastructures and directory solutions, including third party directories, as well as our Directory solution. Within our SSO solution, our adaptive authentication policies enable organizations to predictively authenticate users in real-time based on device, network, application and user behavior data. 
​
Multi-Factor Authentication. Our adaptive MFA solution helps optimize the balance between security and user experience by enforcing additional authentication factors as necessary when accessing sensitive resources, conducting high-value transactions and engaging in other elevated risk scenarios. Adaptive MFA allows users to conduct low-value transactions from trusted devices without interruption, while prompting MFA during high-value transactions, activity from untrusted devices and networks or in response to anomalous behavior. Our MFA solution works across use cases with personal or corporate-owned mobile devices and integrates with enterprise mobility management and mobile device management solutions. We offer PingOne MFA, which provides strong authentication of consumer identities, as a SaaS solution.
Access Security. Our Access Security solution allows enterprises to apply a greater depth of security control over their web applications and APIs in any domain for users on any device. We offer a comprehensive policy engine down to the URL level that is designed to ensure only an authorized user can access resources. Our solution evaluates access decisions in real-time based on network, browser and authentication attributes, while continuously validating the risk profile of the user or device. 
​
Directory. Our Directory solution securely stores and manages sensitive identity and device data at scale. It includes real-time, bidirectional synchronization capabilities to migrate or sync data from multiple sources into a secure, scalable and unified profile. This single source of data is designed to provide a consistent experience across digital business interactions, no matter where the applications and services are deployed. 
​
Dynamic Authorization. Our Dynamic Authorization solution provides centralized, fine-grained control over access to sensitive identity and device data across use cases. This gives organizations a centralized, drag-and-drop administration portal to restrict internal and external applications from accessing specific identity attributes such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, billing addresses or the entire user profile. Data access policies can evaluate attributes and preferences of the profile being requested, data from other repositories and information about the application and user making the request. Our Dynamic Authorization solution enables enterprises to comply with a broad range of regulatory requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and others by restricting data that a user has not consented to share and denying access to personal information that applications and users do not need to perform their tasks. 
​
Risk Management. Our Risk Management solution enables organizations to make smarter authentication decisions by using machine learning and analytics to detect malicious activity. Our solution continuously analyzes multiple risk signals to give organizations in-depth user behavior insights to understand the risk in giving a user access to a resource or application. This provides enterprises with the ability to make real-time authentication decisions in determining if a user can access a resource, require additional assurances through step-up authentication or is denied access. Our Risk Management solution enables organizations to create intelligence-based policies to apply the appropriate strong authentication for resources or provide trusted users with a passwordless experience. We offer PingOne Risk, which detects threats in real time to strengthen authentication and reduce log-in fraud, as a SaaS solution.
Identity Verification. Our Identity Verification solution enables enterprises to allow their customers to securely and conveniently verify their identity during enrollment and registration. This provides organizations with an increased level of assurance in the identity of their customers during the onboarding process to prevent fraudulent account creation and activity. Our solution can be integrated into an organization’s mobile application to prompt customers to provide a live face capture and to scan a government-issued ID using their mobile device. The customer’s identity is verified using our solution by matching the live face capture to the image on 

9



the government ID and validating the identification document for authenticity. Our Identity Verification solution assists enterprises in regulated industries, such as financial services and insurance, to meet Know Your Customer (“KYC”) requirements by providing customers a method to prove their identity. We offer PingOne Verify, which streamlines identity verification when customers create new accounts, enroll in new services, or in other cases where risk is elevated, as a SaaS solution. 
API Intelligence. Our API Intelligence solution can apply AI and ML to continuously inspect, report and act on all API activity. Our solution is purpose-built to recognize and respond to attacks that are designed to exploit the unique vulnerabilities of individual APIs. These attacks often go undetected by traditional security tools, such as application firewalls and API gateways. We offer PingOne API Intelligence, which secures all API transactions, as a SaaS solution. 
​
Orchestration. In September 2021, we acquired Singular Key, Inc. (“Singular Key”), a provider of no-code identity and security orchestration to accelerate our entry into the identity orchestration arena. Singular Key’s technology streamlines the integration of identity services, providing a no-code method of creating workflows across multiple identity platforms, including identity verification, fraud, risk, access management, privileged access and identity governance into a unified identity fabric. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, this technology is available through the PingOne Cloud Platform as PingOne DaVinci, enabling Ping Identity’s current and future customers to optimize end-to-end user journeys across third party and Ping Identity systems. 
Fraud Detection. In June 2021, we acquired SecuredTouch, Inc. (“SecuredTouch”), an Israeli-based company with fraud and bot-detection services that allowed us to speed the introduction of PingOne Fraud, a SaaS solution. PingOne Fraud combines real-time behavioral navigation, behavioral biometrics, device attributes, network attributes and much more to detect sophisticated fraud attacks, while ensuring a straight-forward customer experience for trusted users. It conducts individual customer session analysis and produces a risk score to incorporate into your fraud detection policies. 
Our Technology
Our technology has been developed using industry standards and best practices for security, performance, scale and interoperability. Our platform is built on the following core tenets:
​

● | Open Standards. We pioneered open identity standards that reduce the cost and complexity of interoperability and integration between IT vendors and partners. We also participated in the creation of many of the Internet Engineering Task Force standards in the identity space and continue to support the evolution and creation of new standards.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Turnkey Integrations. We provide a broad range of out-of-the-box adapters for “first-mile” and “last-mile” integration to cloud and on-premise applications and other systems. For example, we integrate with major enterprise identity systems, such as Broadcom, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, as well as environments and application platforms such as Apache, Java, IIS, NGINX and WebSphere. In addition, we provide an extensive set of SaaS and social identity connectors that provide full integration with API functions. For example, our ServiceNow integration leverages over 20 user attributes. We also have out-of-the-box integrations with a variety of cloud-based and on-premise data sources, adaptive authentication providers and security and intelligence service providers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Our API Intelligence solution utilizes our proprietary AI/ML capabilities to continuously inspect, report and act on all API activity. We are in the process of leveraging and expanding these AI/ML capabilities across our broader platform to deliver Intelligent Identity security based on device, network, application and user behavior data instead of manual rules and policies. Our core identity and access management solutions provide the flexibility to be deployed with AI, ML and risk management capabilities that Ping Identity has developed, as well as to integrate with AI, ML and risk management capabilities licensed from third parties. Our platform’s goal is to deliver password-less, zero-login capabilities to secure access and enhance user experience. See

“Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We rely on software and services from other parties. Defects in or the loss of access to software or services from third parties could increase our costs and adversely affect the quality of our solutions.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Uptime and Availability. We provide critical uptime and offer advanced redundancy features such as off-line modes to ensure services are available even when internet connectivity is lost. Our multi-tenant cloud-based offering is hosted in multiple regions around the world for redundancy and continuity. Our maintenance windows do not require any downtime, and our platform offered 99.99% uptime across our customer base over the past 12 months.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalability and Performance. Our platform can scale to millions of identities and thousands of cloud and on-premise applications in a single deployment. We are built to scale for 3 billion-plus individual and machine identities globally at speeds that allow for up to 50,000 unique authentications per second.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Self-service. Self-service is becoming increasingly important as IT and IAM teams with limited resources seek to provide centralized IAM to the entire enterprise. The ability for developers to directly integrate identity into their applications accelerates the adoption of identity within the enterprise. Ping Identity’s Orchestration solution offers customers a no-code/low-code method of creating workflows across multiple identity platforms, including identity verification, fraud, risk, access management, privileged access and identity governance into a unified identity fabric. This allows customers to improve deployment speed, accelerate cloud migration, reduce costs and lower the risk associated with vendor lock-in.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Security by Design. We integrate security into all of our solutions. Our security analysts maintain the security of our solutions by monitoring core services, both corporate and customer-facing, for indications of attack or compromise. We partner with trusted third party security firms to perform full-scope assessments and additional architectural reviews of our solutions. We also engage with third-party audit firms to perform SOC2 Type II audits, and ISO 27001-2013 certification of our security program.

Sales and Marketing
Sales
​
We sell our solutions primarily through direct sales. We have a stratified direct sales organization that is organized by customer size and the type of solution and deployment. Within our sales organization, our strategic account executives focus on the largest and most complex enterprises, primarily in the Fortune 1000, that typically purchase multiple products or deployment options. In the last two years, we have also built a sales team focused more intensely on the Global 5000, with account executives that target less complex enterprise customers that typically purchase a single capability or use case upfront and then expand as the complexity of their requirements expand.
​
Our direct sales are enhanced by collaboration with our channel partners in sourcing new leads, aiding in pre-sale processes such as proof of concepts, demos or requests for proposals and reselling our solutions to customers, as well as collaboration with our system integrators and technology partners. We also leverage a number of our channel partners and system integrators to provide the implementation services for some of our larger and more complex deployments, significantly increasing the time-to-value for our customers and maximizing the efficiency of our go-to-market efforts. 
​
Marketing
​
We focus our marketing strategy on building brand recognition through thought leadership and differentiated messaging that communicates the business value of our platform. Our efforts include content marketing, social media, SEO, events and public and analyst relations. We convert this brand awareness into our pipeline through campaigns that integrate digital, social, web and field marketing tactics aimed at adding new customers and

​
Our Customers
At December 31, 2021, we had 1,468 customers. Our customer base is comprised of over half of the Fortune 100. As of December 31, 2021, our customer base included the 9 largest U.S. banks (measured by assets), 7 of the 10 largest healthcare companies (measured by revenue), 5 of the 8 largest North American retailers (measured by revenue), 4 of the 6 largest global aerospace companies (measured by revenue) and the 4 largest European auto manufacturers (measured by revenue). Our customer base is diversified, with no one customer or reseller accounting for more than 2% or 6% of our total revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
​
We also have a highly satisfied customer base, as evidenced by our Net Promoter Score of 61 in 2021. This score is a measure of customer satisfaction determined through customer satisfaction surveys, that ask customers, on a scale from zero to ten, how likely they are to recommend Ping Identity to a friend or colleague. Scores can range from -100 to +100. The survey is sent to all Ping Identity customers on an annual basis. We define a customer as a separate legal entity with an individual subscription agreement and include in our customer count entities which we have sold directly and entities that have purchased one or more solutions from a reseller. 
​

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment agreements and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements, trademarks and patents to protect our intellectual property rights.
We control access to, and use of, our solutions and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology, and such risks may increase as we attempt to expand into jurisdictions where such rights are less easily enforced, or are more subject to reverse engineering or misappropriation due to local legal requirements.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 42 issued United States patents and 15 patent applications pending in the United States relating to certain aspects of our technology. Our issued United States patents expire between December 14, 2031 and October 17, 2039. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any of our existing patents and any that are issued in the future may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. In addition, we have international operations and intend to continue to expand these operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.

Competition
We face competition from (1) legacy providers, (2) cloud-only providers and (3) homegrown solutions.
Legacy providers include Broadcom, IBM and Oracle, among others. These providers generally designed their solutions when enterprise applications were monolithic and on-premise. Their solutions utilize proprietary architectures, which require customized features and integrations to scale. Today, these solutions have the reputation of being complex, costly and increasingly fragile. Thus, legacy providers often struggle to offer a single comprehensive solution that spans all IT environments, including cloud and on-premise.
We also compete with cloud-only providers, such as Okta and One Identity. These providers have solutions that are historically geared towards small and medium-sized businesses that have IT infrastructures hosted entirely in the cloud. The vast majority of large enterprises do not have the ability to operate their businesses solely with cloud infrastructures, and thus require enterprise solutions that support complex hybrid IT environments and the wide variety of applications and workloads found in enterprise IT portfolios. Thus, a cloud-only IAM solution cannot deliver a single comprehensive solution that enterprises require to provide end-to-end coverage across their complex IT landscape.
Microsoft also competes in our market and has tied its identity services to both Azure and its Office365 offerings. However, we partner with Microsoft to provide SSO, security control and adaptive MFA where non-Microsoft environments require integration or independence is preferred. Microsoft’s integration and interoperability with our solutions benefits enterprises while providing optionality and choice. We also compete against providers such as ForgeRock, that offers highly customizable solutions for both the customer and workforce use case and on-premise and cloud deployment options. We believe that these solutions require a longer and less predictable timeline for implementation due to custom coding requirements, while Ping Identity is typically able to offer more efficient and predictable implementation of its enterprise products.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the IAM market include: (1) the ability to address all primary use cases from one platform; (2) the ability to deploy in large, complex hybrid IT environments; (3) the ability to integrate easily with all applications (cloud and on-premise); (4) technology uptime, reliability, scalability and performance; (5) the ability to support open standards; and (6) customer, technology and platform support. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.
Human Capital Disclosures
Ping Identity is committed to championing and protecting every identity, from our customers to those of our most valuable asset: our employees. Trust is core to who we are and to what we do, and we understand that how we work together is just as important as what we accomplish. We are committed to treating all who enter the Ping Identity ecosystem with respect and honesty. 
Our Employees
We recognize that our ability to attract, develop and retain talent is key to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,247 employees worldwide, with 67% located in the U.S. and 33% located abroad.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”)
At Ping Identity, we are committed to championing and embracing diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We believe that innovation and creativity is maximized through having and supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce. In 2021, to further our commitment we hired our first Director of DEI to lead our DEI initiatives. 
We employ inclusive recruitment and hiring practices to source diverse talent and mitigate potential bias throughout the hiring process. We also continue to recruit from a broad range of colleges and engage with organizations that support diverse students and jobseekers.

14



Our employees are invited to participate in our internal employee resource groups (“ERGs”), which seek to engage, connect and create a supportive environment for our employees. ERGs are comprised of employees who are linked by social factors such as culture, gender, sexual orientation, or by a common interest or goal. These employee-led groups foster diverse and inclusive workplaces aligned with our values, objectives and business practices.
Career Development
​
At Ping Identity, we have a Learning and Performance Department with the mission to ensure that each of our valued employees achieves professional excellence which then enables them to actively contribute to the effectiveness and excellence of our company. Our Learning and Performance and Human Resources Departments collaborate with other Ping Identity departments across the organization to assist employees in achieving high performance. At Ping Identity, we strive to deliver world-class learning opportunities to improve employee performance, reduce risk and regulatory noncompliance, and deliver an extraordinary customer experience.

At Ping Identity we are committed to providing fair, market competitive pay that supports the needs of our employees and also engages our employees to achieve goals related to our success. Our strategy includes base salary, short-term company bonus or sales-related commission, and long-term incentive through employee equity awards for eligible employees. 
​
We are committed to pay equity at Ping. We believe fair and unbiased compensation is a critical component to inclusive culture and ultimately helps us attract and retain the highest caliber talent. As part of our commitment to pay equity and in addition to our internal practices to drive pay equity, in 2020, Ping engaged an independent third party to conduct a pay equity analysis to help ensure that our compensation practices and structure are equitable. Ping Identity intends to continue prioritizing pay equity and we plan to continue to conduct third party pay equity analyses on a rolling basis.
​
Benefits
​
In addition to competitive pay, our total rewards program includes comprehensive and inclusive employee benefits and a variety of other health and wellness options. Our benefits and perks include a 100% Ping Identity paid healthcare option, 100% paid parental leave, retirement savings with employer match, unlimited PTO, commuter offset, fitness stipend, in-office snacks and drinks, and charitable giving match. Ping Identity is also proud to offer inclusive benefits for our employees who undergo or are pursuing gender transition. 
​
We evaluate benefits plans against competitors and locally provided entitlements each year to ensure they meet the evolving needs of our employees.
​
Company Ethos and Ethics
​
Conducting our business ethically and in a socially responsible way is one of the core pillars of our foundation at Ping Identity. All employees adhere to our Employee Handbook which outlines our values, security guidelines, and codes of conduct along with other internal policies and procedures. Our Code of Ethics applies to all employees including all executive officers and directors and is available on our web site.

Ping in the Community
​
We strive to be a good corporate citizen and leave a positive impact in the communities where we operate. In 2021, Ping Identity prioritized community volunteerism, service and charitable donations supporting education and local initiatives by partnering with local educational organizations to support female students interested in STEAM fields, establishing a four-year college scholarship for an underrepresented minority student, establishing an employee day of service and charitable contribution matching program for employees. As we develop and grow our DEI strategy and plan, we intend to work with our ERGs to help us identify additional communities, service opportunities, and charities that are significant to their members.
​
Health, Safety and Wellness
​
Team member health and safety is core to our successful operations across all areas of our business. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health.
​
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes to protect the health and safety of our employees, including: 
​

● | building a COVID-19 Response Team comprised of facilities, security, HR, IT and business leaders;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implementing office closures as required so non-essential employees could work remotely; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | conducting several pulse surveys of our team members, with special focus on our COVID-19 response and opportunities for improvement to ensure we understood team member concerns and could proactively address those concerns.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We believe we have been able to preserve our business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 to ensure that we continue to operate safely for all stakeholders.
