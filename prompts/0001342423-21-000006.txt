Item 1. Business
Limoneira Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor to several businesses with operations in California since 1893. Our business and operations are described below. For detailed financial information with respect to our business and our operations, see our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 in this Annual Report. In addition, general information concerning our Company can be found on our website, the internet address of which is www.limoneira.com. All of our filings with the SEC, including but not limited to, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto, are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
Overview
We are primarily an agribusiness company founded and based in Santa Paula, California, committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately 15,400 acres of land, water resources and other assets to maximize long-term stockholder value. Our current operations consist of fruit production, sales and marketing, rental operations, real estate and capital investment activities.
We are one of California’s oldest citrus growers. According to Sunkist Growers, Inc. (“Sunkist”), we are one of the largest growers of lemons in the United States and, according to the California Avocado Commission, one of the largest growers of avocados in the United States. In addition to growing lemons and avocados, we grow oranges and a variety of specialty citrus and other crops. We have agricultural plantings throughout Ventura, Tulare, San Luis Obispo and San Bernardino Counties in California, Yuma County in Arizona, La Serena, Chile and Jujuy, Argentina, which collectively consist of approximately 6,000 acres of lemons, 900 acres of avocados, 1,400 acres of oranges and 900 acres of specialty citrus and other crops. We also operate our own packinghouses in Santa Paula and Oxnard, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process, pack and sell lemons that we grow, as well as lemons grown by others. We have a 47% interest in Rosales S.A. (“Rosales”), a citrus packing, marketing and sales business, a 90% interest in Fruticola Pan de Azucar S.A. (“PDA”), a lemon and orange orchard and 100% interest in Agricola San Pablo SpA. ("San Pablo"), a lemon and orange orchard, all of which are located near La Serena, Chile. We have a 51% interest in a joint venture, Trapani Fresh Consorcio de Cooperacion ("Trapani Fresh"), a lemon growing, packing, marketing and selling business in Argentina.
Our water resources include water rights, usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under, and canals that run through, the land we own. Water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land, which includes rights to water in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and the un-adjudicated Fillmore and Paso Robles Basins (aquifers). We use ground water from the San Joaquin Valley Basin and water from local water and irrigation districts in Tulare County, which is in California’s San Joaquin Valley. We also use ground water from the Cadiz Valley Basin in California’s San Bernardino County and surface water in Arizona from the Colorado River through the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District (“YMIDD”). We use ground water provided by wells and surface water for our PDA and San Pablo farming operations in Chile and our Trapani Fresh farming operations in Argentina.
For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic investments in California agriculture and real estate. We currently have an interest in three real estate development projects in California. These projects include multi-family housing and single-family homes comprising 256 completed rental units and another approximately 1,150 units in various stages of planning and development.
Fiscal Year 2020 Highlights and Recent Developments
We are equal partners in a joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (“Lewis”) for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC (the "LLCB" or "Joint Venture"). The first phase of the project broke ground to commence mass grading in November 2017. The Joint Venture has closed on lot sales representing 354 units from inception through October 31, 2020.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sevilla property for $2.7 million. After transaction and other costs, we expect to receive proceeds of approximately $2.6 million and recognize an insignificant gain. At October 31, 2020, the $2.5 million carrying value of the property was classified as held for sale and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
In March 2020, we entered into a revolving equity line of credit promissory note and loan agreement with Farm Credit West for a $15.0 million Revolving Equity Line of Credit (the "RELOC") secured by a first lien on the Windfall Investors, LLC property. The RELOC matures in 2043 and features a 3-year draw period followed by 20 years of fully amortized loan payments. The interest rate 
 5


is variable with monthly interest-only payments during the 3-year draw period and monthly principal and interest payments thereafter.
In March 2020, we sold our remaining 200,000 shares of Calavo Growers, Inc. ("Calavo") common stock at an average price of $55.29 per share. Net proceeds from the sale were $11.0 million and we recognized a loss of $6.3 million. 
In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law. The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions, temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes, the creation of certain refundable employee retention credits, and technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property. We evaluated the impact of the CARES Act on our consolidated financial statements and recorded approximately $1.9 million of income tax benefit and applied for $5.8 million of federal refunds and an additional $0.9 million of California refunds in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, of which $0.8 million and $5.0 million were received in October 2020 and December 2020, respectively.
On March 12, 2020, the Board of Directors of our Company approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $10.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through March 2021. Under the share repurchase program, purchases of shares of common stock may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase shares of our common stock. During fiscal year 2020, we repurchased 250,977 shares under the share repurchase program for approximately $3.5 million. As of October 31, 2020, the remaining authorization under this program is approximately $6.5 million.
On June 30, 2020, we entered into a Conversion Agreement with Farm Credit West to convert our term loans to fixed interest rate loans effective July 1, 2020. No changes were made to the outstanding principal balances on the loans and we made no cash repayments of principal. The rates are subject to a prepayment restriction period for a portion of the fixed rate term that will expire on January 1, 2021, after which we may prepay any amounts without penalty.
In August 2020, we sold a property, located in Lindsay, California. We received net proceeds of $6.0 million and after transaction and other costs, we recorded a loss of approximately $0.4 million as of October 31, 2020.
On December 15, 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per common share payable on January 15, 2021, in the aggregate amount of $1.3 million to stockholders of record as of December 28, 2020. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
The global spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in recent months has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The impact of this pandemic has created significant uncertainty in the global economy and has affected our business, employees, suppliers, and customers. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the industries and markets in which we conduct business. In particular, the United States lemon market has seen a significant decline in volume. Lemon demand began falling in mid-March when wide spread shelter in place orders were issued, resulting in a significant market oversupply. The export market for fresh produce has also significantly declined due to COVID-19 impacts.
The decline in demand for our products beginning the second quarter of 2020, which we believe was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacted our sales and profitability for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. We also expect an adverse impact on our sales and profitability in future periods. These impacts are expected to be material. However, the duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be precisely estimated at this time, as they are affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside management’s control, including, but not limited, to those presented in - Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Although subject to unforeseen changes that may arise as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, we currently expect improvement in fiscal year 2021.
We took proactive actions early on to protect the health of our employees and their families, including curtailing business travel and encouraging video conferencing whenever possible. In addition, as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened throughout the spring, we allowed personnel to work remotely to the extent possible. While we believe we have responded appropriately to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation evolves, we will continue to analyze additional mitigation measures that may be needed to preserve the health and safety of our workforce and our customers and the ongoing continuity of our business operations. Those measures might include modifying workspaces, continuing social distancing policies, implementing new personal 
 6


protective equipment or health screening policies at our facilities, or such other industry best practices needed to continue to maintain a healthy and safe environment for our employees amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken actions to improve our current liquidity position, including temporarily postponing capital expenditures, selling equity securities to increase cash, reducing operating costs, and substantially reducing discretionary spending.
We are one of the largest growers of lemons and avocados in the United States and maintain our country's food chain infrastructure and thus are considered an essential business and permitted to remain open during the ongoing pandemic, be it at reduced volumes, in order to fulfill our customers' needs. However, there is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of our business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy, the ongoing business operations of our clients and our results of operations and financial condition. While our management team is actively monitoring the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and clients or as required by federal, state, or local authorities, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2021 and beyond cannot be fully estimated at this point. The following discussions are subject to the future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ongoing business operations.
Business Division Summary 
We have three business divisions: agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development. The agribusiness division is comprised of three reportable operating segments: fresh lemons, lemon packing and other agribusiness, which includes avocados, oranges, specialty citrus and other crops. The agribusiness division includes our core operations of farming, harvesting, lemon packing and lemon sales operations. The rental operations include our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. The real estate development division includes our investments in real estate development projects. 
Agribusiness Summary
Farming
Lemons. We market and sell lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers throughout the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia and certain other international markets. We are one of the largest lemon growers in the United States with approximately 6,000 acres of lemons planted primarily in Ventura, Tulare and San Bernardino Counties in California and in Yuma County, Arizona. In California, the lemon growing area stretches from the Coachella Valley to Fresno and Monterey Counties, with the majority of the growing areas located in the coastal areas from Ventura County to Monterey County. Ventura County is California’s top lemon producing county. Approximately 26% of our lemons are grown in Ventura County, 22% are grown in Tulare County, 17% are grown in Yuma County, Arizona and 10% are grown in San Bernardino County, California. We also grow approximately 5% of our lemons near La Serena, Chile and 20% of our lemons in Argentina.
There are over fifty varieties of lemons, with the Lisbon, Eureka and Genoa being the predominant varieties marketed on a worldwide basis. Approximately 87% of our lemon plantings are of the Lisbon, Eureka and Genoa varieties and approximately 13% are of other varieties such as sweet Meyer lemons, Proprietary Seedless lemons and Pink Variegated lemons. California-grown lemons are available throughout the year, with peak production periods occurring from January through August. The storage life of fresh lemons generally ranges from one to 18 weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
Avocados. We are one of the largest avocado growers in the United States with approximately 900 acres of avocados planted throughout Ventura County. In California, the avocado growing area stretches from San Diego County to Monterey County, with the majority of the growing areas located approximately 100 miles north and south of Los Angeles County.
California-grown avocados are available year-round, with peak production periods occurring between February and September. Other avocado varieties have a more limited picking season and typically command a lower price. Because of superior eating quality, the Hass avocado has contributed greatly to the avocado’s growing popularity through its retail, restaurant and other food service uses. Approximately 95% of our avocado plantings are of the Hass variety. The storage life of fresh avocados generally ranges from one to four weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.
We provide a majority of our avocado production to Calavo, a packing and marketing company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CVGW. Calavo’s customers include many of the largest retail and food service companies in the United States and Canada. Calavo receives fruit from our orchards at its packinghouse located in Santa Paula, California. Calavo’s 
 7


proximity to our agricultural operations enables us to keep transportation and handling costs to a minimum. Our avocados are packed by Calavo and sold and distributed under its own brands to its customers primarily in the United States and Canada.
Primarily due to differing soil conditions, the care of avocado trees is intensive and during our 80-year history of growing avocados, growing techniques have changed dramatically. The need for more production per acre to compete with foreign sources of supply has required us to take an important lead in the practice of dense planting (typically four times the number of avocado trees per acre versus traditional avocado plantings) and mulching composition to help trees acclimate under conditions that more closely resemble those found in the tropics, a better climate for avocado growth.
Oranges, Specialty Citrus and Other Crops. We have approximately 1,400 acres of oranges planted primarily in Tulare County, California. In California, the growing area for oranges stretches from Imperial County to Yolo County. California-grown Navel oranges are available from October to June, with peak production periods occurring between January and April. Approximately 96% of our orange plantings are of the Navel variety and approximately 4% are of the Valencia variety. We estimate approximately 70% of our oranges are sold to retail customers and approximately 30% are sold to wholesale customers. We currently have approximately 900 acres of specialty citrus and other crops planted such as Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios and wine grapes.
We utilize third-party packinghouses to process and pack our oranges and specialty citrus. A portion of our oranges and specialty citrus is marketed and sold under the Sunkist brand by Sunkist and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses. As an agricultural cooperative, Sunkist coordinates the sales and marketing of the oranges and specialty citrus and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses for direct shipment to customers.
We currently market our other crops, such as pistachios and wine grapes, utilizing processors that are not members of agricultural cooperatives. Our pistachios are harvested and sold to a roaster, packager and marketer of nuts, and our wine grapes are sold to various wine producers.

The Limoneira/Olivelands Ranch is the original site of our Company. Our headquarters, lemon packing operations and storage facilities are located on this property.
The Teague McKevett Ranch is the site of our real estate development project known as East Area I and described below under the “Real Estate Development Summary” heading.
The other agribusiness land in the table above includes corporate and lemon packing facilities, land leased to other agricultural businesses, rental units, roads, creeks, hillsides and other open land.
Our orchards can maintain production for many years. For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate our orchards from 20 to 40 years depending on the fruit variety with the majority of our orchards depreciated over 20 to 30 years. We regularly evaluate our orchards’ production and growing costs and based on these and other factors, we may decide to redevelop certain orchards. In addition, we may acquire agricultural property with existing productive orchards or without productive orchards, which would require new orchard plantings. The fruit varieties that we grow are typically non-producing for approximately the first four years after planting. Orchards may continue producing fruit longer than their depreciable lives. The following table presents the number of acres planted by fruit variety and approximate age of our orchards:

Lemon Packing and Sales
We are the oldest continuous lemon packing operation in North America. We pack and sell lemons grown by us as well as lemons grown by others, the operations of which are included in our financial statements under the lemon packing segment. Lemons delivered to our packinghouses in Santa Paula and Oxnard, California and Yuma, Arizona are sized, graded, cooled, ripened and packed for delivery to customers. Our ability to accurately estimate the size, grade and timing of the delivery of the annual lemon crop has a substantial impact on both our costs and the sales price we receive for the fruit.
A significant portion of the costs related to our lemon packing operation is fixed. Our strategy for growing the profitability of our lemon packing operations calls for optimizing the percentage of a crop that goes to the fresh market, or fresh utilization, and procuring a larger percentage of the California and Arizona lemon crop.
We invest considerable time and research into refining and improving our lemon packing through innovation and are continuously searching for new techniques to refine how premium lemons are delivered to our consumers. In fiscal year 2016, our updated lemon packing facility became operational which doubled our lemon packing capacity and increased the efficiency and financial results of these operations.
Rental Operations Summary
Our rental operations include our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. 
We own and maintain 256 residential housing units located in Ventura and Tulare Counties in California that we lease to employees, former employees and non-employees. We also own several commercial office buildings and as with our residential housing units, these properties generate reliable cash flows that we use to partially fund the operating costs of our business. As of October 31, 2020, we lease approximately 500 acres of our land to third-party agricultural tenants who grow a variety of row crops. Our leased land business provides us with a profitable method to diversify the use of our land. We also partner with one of our tenants and have an organic recycling facility on our land in Ventura County. 
Real Estate Development Summary
We invest in real estate development projects and recognize that long-term strategies are required for successful real estate development activities. Our goal is to redeploy real estate earnings and cash flow into the expansion of our agribusiness and other income producing real estate. For real estate development projects and joint ventures, it is not unusual for the timing and amounts of revenues and costs, partner contributions and distributions, project loans, other financing assumptions and project cash flows to be impacted by government approvals, project revenue and cost estimates and assumptions, economic conditions, financing sources and product demand as well as other factors. Such factors could affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 
For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic real estate investments in California agricultural and developable real estate. Our current real estate developments include developable land parcels, multi-family housing and single-family homes with approximately 1,150 units in various stages of planning and development. The following is a summary of each of the strategic agricultural and development real estate investment properties in which we own an interest:
East Area I - Santa Paula, California. East Area I consists of 523 acres that we historically used as agricultural land and is located in Santa Paula approximately ten miles from the City of Ventura and the Pacific Ocean. This property is also known as our Teague McKevett Ranch. We believe East Area I is an ideal location for a master planned community of commercial and residential properties designed to satisfy expected demand in a region that we believe will have few other developments in this coming decade. In 2008, after we completed a process of community planning and environmental review, the citizens of Santa Paula voted to approve the annexation of East Area I into Santa Paula. This vote was a requirement of the Save Open-Space and Agricultural Resources (“SOAR”), ordinance that mandates a public vote of the City of Santa Paula for land use conversion.
In November 2015, we entered into the Joint Venture with Lewis for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed LLCB as the development entity, contributed our East Area I property to the Joint Venture and sold a 50% interest in the Joint Venture to Lewis for $20.0 million. We expect to receive approximately $100.0 million from the Joint Venture over the estimated 10 to 12-year life of the project, including $20.0 million received on the consummation of the Joint Venture. The Joint Venture partners will share in capital contributions to fund project costs until loan proceeds and/or revenues are sufficient to fund the project. Since inception, each Joint Venture partner has made funding contributions of $21.4 million, including $2.8 million, $4.0 million and $3.5 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The first phase of the project broke ground to commence mass grading in November 2017. Project plans include approximately 1,500 residential units with 632 residential units in Phase 1 and site improvements substantially completed. Lot sales 
 10


representing 144 and 210 residential units closed in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively and 354 residential units have closed from the project's inception to October 31, 2020. The Joint Venture closed an additional 44 units in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
East Area II - Santa Paula, California. Our design associates and we are in the process of formulating plans for East Area II, a parcel of approximately 30 acres adjacent to East Area I. East Area II is also a part of our Teague McKevett Ranch, which we believe is suited to commercial and/or industrial development along the south side of California Highway 126, a heavily traveled corridor that connects Highway 101 at Ventura on the west with Interstate 5 at Santa Clarita on the east. When completed, we expect that the development will contribute to the economic vitality of the region and allow residents to work and shop within close proximity to their homes.
The successful development of East Area II will be partly dependent on the success of East Area I. We expect that East Area II could accommodate large retailers, a medium or large employer, a complex of mixed business and retail, or some combination of the foregoing. We are actively cultivating prospects to become future tenants in East Area II and expect that development will closely follow the build-out of East Area I.
Santa Maria - Santa Barbara County, California. As of October 31, 2020, we were invested in one entitled development parcel, Sevilla, located in Santa Maria in Santa Barbara County, California. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Sevilla property for $2.7 million, which is expected to close in fiscal year 2021.
Markets and Competitive Strengths
Agribusiness Operations
With agricultural operations dating back to 1893, we are one of California’s oldest citrus growers and one of the largest growers of lemons and avocados in the United States. Consequently, we have developed significant experience with a variety of crops, mainly lemons, avocados and oranges. The following is a brief list of what we believe are our significant competitive strengths with respect to our agribusiness operations:
•Our agricultural properties in Ventura County are located near the Pacific Ocean, which provides an ideal environment for growing lemons, avocados and row crops. Our agricultural properties in Tulare County, which is in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, and in Yuma, Arizona, are also located in areas that are well-suited for growing citrus crops.
•Historically, a higher percentage of our crops go to the fresh market, which is commonly referred to as fresh utilization, than that of other growers and packers with which we compete.
•We have contiguous and nearby land resources that permit us to efficiently use our agricultural land and resources.
•In all but one of our properties, we are not dependent on State or Federal water projects to support our agribusiness or real estate development operations.
•We own approximately 94% of our agricultural land and take a long view on our fruit production practices.
•A significant amount of our agribusiness property was acquired many years ago, which results in a low-cost basis and associated expenses.
•In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, our integrated business model with respect to growing, packing, marketing and selling lemons allows us to better serve our customers.
•Our lemon packing operations provide marketing opportunities with other citrus companies and their respective products.
•We have made investments in ground-based solar projects that provide us with tangible and intangible non-revenue generating benefits. The electricity generated by these investments provides us with a significant portion of the electricity required to operate our packinghouse and cold storage facilities located in Santa Paula, California and provides a significant portion of the electricity required to operate four deep-water well pumps at one of our ranches in Tulare County, California. Additionally, these investments support our sustainable agricultural practices, reduce our dependence on fossil-based electricity generation and lower our carbon footprint. Moreover, electricity that we generate and do not use is conveyed seamlessly back to the investor-owned utilities operating in these two markets. Finally, over time, we expect that our customers and the end consumers of our fruit will value the investments that we have made in renewable energy as a part of our farming and packing operations, which we believe may help us differentiate our products from similar commodities.
•We have made various other investments in water rights and mutual water companies. We own shares in the following mutual water companies: Farmers Irrigation Co., Canyon Irrigation Co., San Cayetano Mutual Water Co., Middle Road 
 11


Mutual Water Co. and Pioneer Water Company, Inc. Additionally, we acquired water rights in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer), the YMIDD and in Chile.
Real Estate Development Operations
With respect to our real estate development operations, we believe our competitive advantages are as follows:
•We have entitlements to build approximately 1,500 residential units in our East Area I (Harvest at Limoneira) development.
•We have partnered with an experienced and financially strong land developer for our East Area I residential master plan development.
•Several of our agricultural and real estate investment properties are unique and carry longer-term development potential.
•Our East Area II property has approximately 30 acres of land commercially zoned, which is adjacent to our East Area I property.
Business Strategy
We are an agribusiness and real estate development company that generates annual cash flows to support investments in agricultural and real estate development activities. As our agricultural and real estate development investments are monetized, we intend to seek to expand our agribusiness into new regions and markets and invest in cash-producing residential, commercial and industrial rental assets.
The following describes the key elements of our business strategy.
Agribusiness
With respect to our agribusiness operations, key elements of our strategy are:
•Acquire Additional Lemon Producing Properties.  To the extent attractive opportunities arise and our capital availability permits, we intend to consider the acquisition of additional lemon producing properties. In order to be considered, such properties would need to have certain characteristics to provide acceptable returns, such as an adequate source of water, a warm micro-climate and well-drained soils. We anticipate that the most attractive opportunities to acquire lemon producing properties will be in South America and in the San Joaquin Valley near our existing operations in Tulare County, California.
•Expand our Sources of Lemon Supply.  Peak lemon production occurs at different times of the year depending on geographic region. In addition to our lemon production in California and Arizona and lemons we acquire from third-party growers, we have expanded our lemon supply sources to international markets such as Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Increases in lemons procured from third-party growers and international sources improve our ability to provide our customers with fresh lemons throughout the year.
•Increase the Volume of our Lemon Packing Operations.  We regularly monitor our costs for redundancies and opportunities for cost reductions. In this regard, cost per carton is a function of throughput. We continually seek to acquire additional lemons from third-party growers to pack through our plants. Third-party growers are only added if we determine their fruit is of good quality and can be cost effective for both the grower and us. Of most importance is the overall fresh utilization rate for our fruit, which is directly related to quality.
•Expand International Production and Marketing of Lemons.  We estimate that we currently have approximately 10% of the fresh lemon market in the United States and a larger share of the United States lemon export market. We intend to explore opportunities to expand our international production and marketing of lemons. We have the ability to supply a wide range of customers and markets and, because we produce high quality lemons, we can export our lemons to international customers, which many of our competitors are unable to supply.
•Construction of an Updated Lemon Packinghouse. Over the years, new machinery and equipment along with upgrades have been added to our original packinghouse and cold storage facilities. This, along with an aggressive and proactive maintenance program, has allowed us to operate an efficient, competitive lemon packing facility. A project to double the capacity and increase the efficiency of our lemon packing facilities became operational in fiscal year 2016. We expect that 
 12


this project will has increased fresh lemon processing capacity and lower packing costs by reducing labor and handling inputs.
•Opportunistically Expand our Plantings of Avocados, Oranges, Specialty Citrus and Other Crops.  Our plantings of avocados, oranges, specialty citrus and other crops have been profitable and have been pursued to diversify our product line. Agricultural land that we believe is not suitable for lemons is typically planted with oranges, specialty citrus or other crops. While we may expand our avocados, oranges, specialty citrus and other crops, we expect to do so on an opportunistic basis in locations that we believe offer a record of historical profitability.
•Maintain our Relationship with Calavo. Our alignment with Calavo comprises our current marketing strategy for avocados. Calavo has expanded its sourcing into other regions of the world, including Mexico, Chile and Peru, which allows it to supply avocados to its retail and food service customers on a year-round basis. California avocados occupy a unique market window in the year-round supply chain and Calavo has experienced a general expansion of volume as consumption has grown. Thus, we intend to continue to have a strong and viable market for our California avocados.
Other Operations
With respect to our rental operations and real estate development activities, key elements of our strategy include the following:
•Secure Additional Rental and Housing Units.  Our housing, commercial and land rental operations provide us with a consistent, dependable source of cash flow that helps to fund our overall activities. Additionally, we believe our housing rental operation allows us to offer a unique benefit to our employees. 
•Opportunistically Lease Land to Third-Party Crop Farmers.  We regularly monitor the profitability of our fruit-producing acreage to ensure acceptable per acre returns. When we determine that leasing the land to third-party row crop farmers would be more profitable than farming the land, we intend to seek third-party row crop tenants.
•Opportunistically Expand our Income-Producing Commercial and Industrial Rental Assets.  We intend to redeploy our future financial gains to acquire additional income-producing real estate investments and agricultural properties.
•Selectively and Responsibly Develop our Agricultural Land. We recognize that long-term strategies are required for successful real estate development activities. We thus intend to maintain our position as a responsible agricultural landowner and major employer in Ventura County while focusing our real estate development activities on those agricultural land parcels that we believe offer the best opportunities to demonstrate our long-term vision for our community.
Customers
We market and sell our lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers in the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia, Europe and certain other international markets. We sold lemons to approximately 230 U.S. and international customers during fiscal year 2020. We sell a majority of our avocados to Calavo. Our oranges, specialty citrus and other crops are sold through Sunkist and other third-party packinghouses and our wine grapes are sold to wine producers.
Information about Geographic Areas
During fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had an aggregate of approximately $3.5 million, $3.2 million and $2.8 million of total sales in Chile by PDA and San Pablo, respectively. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we had an aggregate of approximately $14.2 million and $14.7 million of total sales in Argentina by Trapani Fresh. The majority of our avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops are sold to packinghouses and processors located in the United States.
Competition
The agribusiness crop markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Generally, there are a large number of global producers that sell through joint marketing organizations and cooperatives. Fruit is also sold to independent packers, both public and private, who then sell to their own customer base. Customers are typically large retail chains, food service companies, industrial manufacturers and distributors who sell and deliver to smaller customers in local markets throughout the world. In the purest sense, our largest competitors in our agribusiness segments are other citrus and avocado producers in California, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Florida, a number of which are members of cooperatives such as Sunkist or have selling relationships with Calavo similar to 
 13


that of Limoneira. Our lemons and oranges also compete with other fruits and vegetables for the share of consumer expenditures devoted to fresh fruit and vegetables: apples, pears, melons, pineapples and other tropical fruit. Avocado products compete in the supermarket with hummus products and other dips and salsas. For our specific crops, the size of the U.S. market is approximately $690 million for lemons, both fresh and juice, approximately $400 million for avocados, and approximately $1.7 billion for oranges, both fresh and juice. Competition in the various agribusiness markets is affected by reliability of supply, product quality, brand recognition and perception, price and the ability to satisfy changing customer preferences through innovative product offerings.
The sale and leasing of residential, commercial and industrial real estate is very competitive, with competition coming from numerous and varied sources throughout California. Our greatest direct competition for each of our current real estate development properties in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties comes from other residential and commercial developments in nearby areas.
Resources and Raw Materials
In our fresh lemons and lemon packing segments, paper is considered a material raw product for our business because most of our products are packed in cardboard cartons for shipment. Paper is readily available and we have numerous suppliers for such material. In our agribusiness division, petroleum-based products such as herbicides and pesticides are considered raw materials and we have numerous suppliers for these products.
Intellectual Property
We have numerous trademarks and brands under which we market and sell our fruits, particularly lemons, domestically and internationally, many of which have been owned for decades. The material brands of Limoneira lemons include, but are not limited to, Santa®, Paula®, Bridal Veil®, Fountain®, Golden Bowl® and Level®. These trademarks are owned by us and registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also acquired certain lemon brands with acquisitions, including Kiva® and Kachina®, Oxnard Lemon, Uno, Sunny, Trapani, Argentinian Beauty, Natural and Trapani Fresh.
Seasonal Nature of Business
As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations are predominantly seasonal in nature. The harvest and sale of our lemons, avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops occurs in all quarters, but is generally more concentrated during our third quarter. Our lemons are generally grown and marketed throughout the year, our avocados are primarily sold from January through August, our oranges are primarily sold from January through June, our specialty citrus is sold from November through April and our specialty crops, such as pistachios and wine grapes, are sold in September and October.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Our agribusiness and real estate development divisions are subject to a broad range of evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. For example, the growing, packing, storing and distributing of our products is extensively regulated by various federal and state agencies. The California State Department of Food and Agriculture oversees our packing and processing of lemons and conducts tests for fruit quality and packaging standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern the use of pesticides and other potentially hazardous substances and the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties. Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance. We believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws, regulations, permits and licenses. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations for necessary permits and licenses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions. These remedies can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
Limoneira is an agricultural and community development company which, based upon its rich heritage and traditions, seeks not only to maximize value for its customers and shareholders, but also to enhance its legacy by employing sustainable practices in all aspects of operations including stewardship of both its natural and human resources. The Company recognizes the increased emphasis by shareholders, business partners and other key constituents in recent years on ESG programs that are embedded into 
 14


day-to-day business policies and practices. The Company is proud of its commitment to doing the right thing for communities, the environment and its employees.
Governance
Corporate responsibility is an important priority for the Company and its Board of Directors. We have a long history of strong commitment to being an ethical and responsible company acting with integrity and respect for each other, our communities and the environment. The Board of Directors tasked the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with the responsibility for overseeing our environmental, social responsibility and sustainability programs and practices, including the consideration of potential long- and short-term trends and impacts that environmental and social responsibility and sustainability issues may have related to our business.
Environmental
Sustainability has been a mindset at Limoneira that was instilled by the Company’s founders over 127 years ago and is the basis of our corporate culture at Limoneira. Not only does Limoneira’s sustainable agriculture address many environmental and social concerns, it offers innovative and economically viable opportunities for Limoneira and other producers, employees, consumers, and policy makers in the entire global food system.
Food Safety
From 2010 to 2019, we achieved and maintained GLOBALG.A.P. certification by successfully demonstrating our adherence to specific Good Agricultural Practices ("GAP") and other farming standards. Beginning in fiscal 2020, Limoneira has received the highest rating (Superior) from Primus Labs, the first certification body of the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). PrimusGFS is focused on the food safety of the agricultural sector products and establishes a series of GAP and other requirements for managing the production, handling, processing and storing operations. We believe that our certification differentiates us from our competitors and serves as reassurance to consumers and retailers that food reaches acceptable levels of safety and quality, and has been produced sustainably, respecting the health, safety and welfare of workers and the environment, and in consideration of animal welfare issues. Limoneira adheres to all food safety regulations and follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) as established in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 1 10), which have led to the Company’s food safety rating being one of the highest in the industry.
Solar Energy
Limoneira has seven solar installations across the Company that produce a total of approximately seven million kilowatts annually and enable us to be approximately 50% off the grid. We also have a 750kWh Tesla scalable energy storage system that reduces energy costs, improves reliability for demand charges and shifts energy use from peak to off peak times.
Water Management
Water is one of our world’s most valuable resources, and the supply of this natural resource faces continual pressure from growing populations, economic activities, and the increasing need for agricultural food production. Limoneira takes important steps to protect this resource. Our water quality and supply is maintained through ground water monitoring, rigorous lab testing, filtration systems, and a network of micro sprinklers. Limoneira constructed a natural wastewater treatment system using patented technology that is a low carbon footprint project with a series of gravity-fed ponds that circulate and clean 30 million gallons of water annually utilizing natural vegetation, local plants and fine gravels. Ultraviolet Rays (UV) remove any bacteria in the water to achieve California Title 22 drinking water standards.
Organic Recycling
With the help of one of our tenants, Agromin, Inc., a processor of premium soil products and a green waste recycler, we developed and implemented an innovative organic recycling facility on our land in Ventura County. This 10 acre facility receives green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark and other plant materials) that would typically go to landfills and converts such material into mulch that we spread throughout our agricultural properties to help curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures.

Biological Pest Management
Limoneira was one of the founders of the Integrated Pest Management program in Ventura County. We have been working with Associates Insectary since 1928 to minimize the use of pesticides by releasing beneficial insects into orchards to control destructive agricultural pests.
Social and Human Capital Resources
Limoneira is committed to protecting the human rights, safety and dignity of the people who contribute to the success of our business. We also seek to support the welfare of the people who produce, process and harvest the products we sell. At October 31, 2020, we had 299 employees, of which 104 were salaried and 195 were hourly. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Health and Safety
Limoneira’s overall culture emphasizes the health and safety of our employees and the customers we serve. Our recent Take a Healthy Stand™ campaign showcases the many ways that lemons can play a role in helping to alleviate serious health issues and our free Nature’s Pharmacy™ app links items found in the produce section of local grocery stores to related health benefits. Our website offers tips, tricks, recipes and other ways to incorporate citrus into everyday life.
Limoneira has an Illness and Injury Prevention Plan (IIPP) and a Safety Guide and conforms to and follows all regulations and guidelines set forth by OSHA in all facilities and operations. Where the State’s guidelines, such as Cal OHSA, are different from the OSHA standard, Limoneira adheres to the most extensive guideline. We have excellent results from our safety programs compared to similar companies within our industry. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented, and continue to improve, appropriate safety measures in all of our facilities and locations. The Company offers comprehensive health insurance coverage to all employees and has a supplemental wellness program.
Employee Engagement
Limoneira has always operated on the principle that all businesses are only as successful as their employees – and content employees are motivated employees. We have a well-trained and retentive labor force with many employees remaining with us for more than 30 years. We offer competitive pay and best-in-class benefits, including a 401k plan with both profit sharing and safe-harbor matching contributions. With approximately 87% of our workforce Hispanic or Latino, to avoid language barriers, we provide bilingual company communications and educational programs such as English as a Second Language. Our new initiative "Every Box Counts" emphasizes our employees’ pride in delivering quality produce from farm to table.
Workforce Housing
We own and maintain 256 residential housing units located in Ventura and Tulare Counties in California that we lease to employees, former employees and non-employees. Our residential units provide affordable housing to many of our employees, including our agribusiness employees. Employees live close to their work, which reduces traffic and commuting times. This unique employment benefit helps us maintain a dependable, long-term employee base.
Community Development and Philanthropy
We have deep roots in our community and each year we collaborate with and devote resources to many worthwhile entities that make our region a special place to live and work. We fund children’s agricultural education, college scholarships, health and human services, industry, community, cultural events and projects that make our communities more vibrant and sustainable. Limoneira also founded a federal credit union onsite to provide agricultural employees an opportunity to accumulate savings and create a source of credit. Management and employees volunteer time and resources for various industry, community and non-profit organizations by serving on their boards and committees and staffing events. Our Harvest at Limoneira master-planned community continues our long history of building, integrating and sustaining community to promote economic, social and cultural vitality in our community.
Business Practices
Limoneira supports the efforts of the Produce Marketing Association and the United Fresh Produce Association to create an industry-wide framework on the responsible production and procurement of fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers. The Ethical Charter on Responsible Labor Practices captures this mission and we adhere to the charter’s guiding principles regarding opposing 
 16


discrimination in any form. We live by our Supplier Code of Conduct in how we approach our business. This Code is global in its scope, and applies to all suppliers and their facilities, as well as our manufacturing facilities. In order to align with international standards, the Code is derived from the policies, standards, and conventions of the United Nations (UN) and the International Labor Organization (ILO), as well as other leading independent standards such as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP). Limoneira’s Board and Management expect the Company’s vendors, suppliers and their products and services to adhere to similar environmental standards.
