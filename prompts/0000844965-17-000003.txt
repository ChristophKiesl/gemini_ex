About TETRA
TETRA Technologies, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading, geographically diversified oil and gas services company, focused on completion fluids and associated products and services, water management, frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, compression services and equipment, and selected offshore services including well plugging and abandonment, decommissioning, and diving. We also have a limited domestic oil and gas production business. We are composed of five reporting segments organized into four divisions - Fluids, Production Testing, Compression, and Offshore.

Our Fluids Division manufactures and markets clear brine fluids, additives, and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling, completion, and workover operations in the United States and in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third-party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry. The Fluids Division also provides domestic onshore oil and gas operators with a wide variety of water management services.
Our Production Testing Division provides frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, and other associated services in many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as in basins in certain regions in South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.
Our Compression Division is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division's equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield pump systems designed and fabricated at the division's facilities. The Compression Division's aftermarket business provides compressor package reconfiguration and maintenance services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Compression Division provides its services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, and Argentina. 
Our Offshore Division consists of two operating segments: Offshore Services and Maritech. The Offshore Services segment provides: (1) downhole and subsea services such as well plugging and abandonment, and workover services; (2) decommissioning and certain construction services utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines; and (3) conventional and saturation diving services.
1

The Maritech segment is a limited oil and gas production operation. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, Maritech sold substantially all of its oil- and gas-producing property interests. Maritech’s operations consist primarily of the ongoing abandonment and decommissioning associated with its remaining offshore wells and production platforms. Maritech intends to acquire a portion of these services from the Offshore Division’s Offshore Services segment.

We continue to pursue a long-term growth strategy that includes expanding our existing core businesses, with the exception of the Maritech segment, through internal growth and acquisitions, domestically and internationally. For financial information for each of our segments, including information regarding revenues and total assets, see “Note Q - Industry Segments and Geographic Information” contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Proactive Strategy to Improve Liquidity and Strengthen Balance Sheet in 2016
During 2016, we were proactive in preparing for changes in the market environment by managing our cost structure, reducing capital expenditures and strengthening our balance sheet. While remaining committed to our long-term growth strategies, our near-term focus during this period of reduced activity and demand was to preserve and enhance liquidity through strategic operating and financial measures. 
These efforts included:

• | In May 2016, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million of our Series 2010-A Senior Notes, Series 2010-B Senior Notes, and Series 2013 Senior Notes, representing the total outstanding principal amount of those notes.


• | In June 2016, we issued and sold 11.5 million shares of common stock in a public offering.


• | In July and December 2016, we entered into amendments of the agreements governing our bank revolving credit facility and our 11% Senior Note to, among other things, favorably amend certain financial covenants.


• | In December 2016, we issued and sold 22.3 million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 11.2 million shares of common stock in a public offering.


• | In the June 2016 and December 2016 equity offerings we received aggregate net proceeds of $168.3 million, which were primarily used to retire outstanding long-term debt.


• | In May 2016 and November 2016, our CSI Compressco LP subsidiary ("CCLP") entered into amendments of the agreement governing its bank revolving credit facility to, among other things, favorably amend certain financial covenants.


• | In August 2016 and September 2016, CCLP issued and sold its newly authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Units in a private placement and used the aggregate net proceeds of $77.3 million to reduce outstanding long-term debt. We purchased a portion of the CCLP Preferred Units for $10.0 million.

(For detailed information on each of these items, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.")

Each of the above described liquidity and balance sheet measures has been implemented to position us to be able to capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise in connection with the long-anticipated recovery of the oil and gas services industry. In 2017, we are seeing indicators of improving demand for certain of our products and services. We and CCLP intend to continue taking the actions we believe appropriate to strengthen our balance sheet and to position us financially to be able to capitalize on opportunities in the recovering market. 

Products and Services 

Fluids Division
Liquid calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, sodium bromide, and blends of such products manufactured by our Fluids Division are referred to as clear brine fluids ("CBFs") in the oil and gas industry. CBFs are salt solutions that have variable densities and are used to control bottomhole pressures during oil and gas completion and workover operations. The Fluids Division sells CBFs and various CBF additives to U.S. and foreign oil and gas exploration and production companies and to other companies that service customers in the oil and gas industry.

2

The Fluids Division provides both stock and custom-blended CBFs based on each customer's specific needs and the proposed application. The Fluids Division provides a broad range of associated CBF services, including: onsite fluids filtration, handling, and recycling; wellbore cleanup; fluid engineering consultation; and fluid management services. The Fluids Division's newest CBF technology, TETRA CS Neptune® completion fluids, continues to be used for our customer's projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We offer to repurchase (buyback) certain used CBFs from customers, which we are able to recondition and recycle. Selling used CBFs back to us reduces the net cost of the CBFs to our customers and minimizes our customers’ need to dispose of used fluids. We recondition used CBFs through filtration, blending, and the use of proprietary chemical processes, and then market the reconditioned CBFs.

By blending different stock CBFs and using various additives, we are able to modify the specific density, crystallization temperature, and chemical composition of the CBFs as necessary. The division’s fluid engineering personnel determine the optimal CBF blend for a customer’s particular application to maximize its effectiveness and lifespan. Our filtration services use a variety of techniques and equipment to remove particulates from CBFs at the customer’s site so that the CBFs can be reused. Filtration also enables recovery of a greater percentage of used CBFs for reconditioning.

The Fluids Division also provides a wide variety of water management services to support the hydraulic fracturing in unconventional well completions for domestic onshore oil and gas operators. These services include water analysis, treatment, storage, transfer, engineering, recycling, and environmental risk mitigation. The Fluids Division's patented equipment and processes include BioRid® treatment services, certain blending technologies, and TETRA STEELTM 1200 rapid deployment water transfer system. The Fluids Division seeks to design environmentally friendly solutions for the unique needs of each customer’s wellsite in order to maximize operational performance, and efficiency and minimize the use of potable water. 

The Fluids Division manufactures liquid and dry calcium chloride, liquid calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide for distribution, primarily into energy markets. Liquid and dry calcium chloride are also sold into water treatment, industrial, cement, food processing, road maintenance, ice melt, agricultural, and consumer products markets. Liquid sodium bromide is also sold into industrial water treatment markets, where it is used as a biocide in recirculated cooling tower waters and in other applications.
Our liquid and dry calcium chloride manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Finland. We also acquire liquid and dry calcium chloride inventory from other producers. In the United States, we manufacture calcium chloride at five manufacturing plant facilities, the largest of which is our plant near El Dorado, Arkansas, which produces liquid and flake calcium chloride products. Liquid and flake calcium chloride are also produced at our Kokkola, Finland, plant. We operate our European calcium chloride operations under the name TETRA Chemicals Europe. We also manufacture liquid calcium chloride at our facilities in Parkersburg, West Virginia and Lake Charles, Louisiana, and we have two solar evaporation facility locations located in San Bernardino County, California, that produce liquid calcium chloride from underground brine reserves which are naturally replenished. All of our calcium chloride production facilities have a combined production capacity of more than 1.5 million equivalent liquid tons per year.
Our Fluids Division manufactures liquid calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide at our West Memphis, Arkansas facility. A patented and proprietary process utilized at this facility uses bromine and zinc to manufacture zinc bromide. This facility also uses proprietary processes to manufacture calcium bromide and sodium bromide and to recondition and upgrade used CBFs that we have repurchased from our customers.

Production Testing Division

Our Production Testing Division provides frac flowback services, early production facilities and services, production well testing services, offshore rig cooling services, and other associated services including well flow management and evaluation services that enable operators to quantify oil and gas reserves, optimize oil and gas production, and minimize oil and gas reservoir damage. In certain gas producing basins, water, sand, and other abrasive materials commonly accompany the initial production of natural gas, often under high pressure and high temperature conditions and, in some cases, from reservoirs containing high levels of hydrogen sulfide gas. The 
3

Production Testing Division provides the specialized equipment and qualified personnel to address these impediments to production. Early production services typically include sophisticated evaluation techniques for reservoir management, including unconventional shale reservoir exploitation and optimization of well workover programs. Frac flowback and production well testing services may include well control, well cleanup, and laboratory analysis. These services are utilized in the completion process after hydraulic fracking and in the production phase of oil and gas wells.

Our Production Testing Division maintains one of the largest fleets of high-pressure production testing equipment in the United States, including equipment designed to work in environments where high levels of hydrogen sulfide gas are present. The division has domestic operating locations in Colorado, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The division also has locations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Kurdistan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and certain countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Production Testing operations in Canada are provided through our Greywolf Energy Services ("Greywolf") subsidiary.

Through our Optima Solutions Holdings Limited subsidiary ("OPTIMA"), the Production Testing Division is a provider of offshore oil and gas rig cooling services and associated products that suppress heat generated by high rate flaring of hydrocarbons during offshore oil and gas well test operations.

Compression Division
Our Compression Division is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division fabricates and sells standard and custom designed compressor packages as well as oilfield fluid pump systems and provides aftermarket services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Compression Division provides its compression services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, and Argentina.
The Compression Division is one of the largest providers of natural gas compression services in the United States. The compression and related services business includes a service fleet of approximately 6,000 compressor packages providing in excess of 1.1 million in aggregate horsepower, utilizing a full spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. Low-horsepower compressor packages enhance production for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells by deliquifying wells, lowering wellhead pressure, and increasing gas velocity. Our low-horsepower compressor packages are also utilized in connection with oil and liquids production and in vapor recovery and casing gas system applications. Low- to medium-horsepower compressor packages are typically utilized in wellhead, gathering, and other applications primarily in connection with oil and liquids production. Our high-horsepower compressor package offerings are typically utilized for natural gas production, natural gas gathering, centralized compression facilities, and midstream applications. 
The horsepower of our compression services fleet on December 31, 2016, is summarized in the following table:

Range of Horsepower Per Package | Number of Packages | Aggregate Horsepower | % of Total Aggregate Horsepower
0 - 100 | 3,904 | 183,100 | 16.4 | %
101 - 800 | 1,626 | 457,809 | 41.1 | %
Over 800 | 353 | 473,403 | 42.5 | %
Total | 5,883 | 1,114,312 | 100 | %

Our Compression Division's equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield fluid pump systems that are designed 
4

and fabricated primarily at its facility in Midland, Texas. Our compressor packages are typically sold to natural gas and oil exploration and production, mid-stream, transmission, and storage companies for use in various applications including gas gathering, gas lift, carbon dioxide injection, wellhead compression, gas storage, refrigeration plant, gas processing, pressure maintenance, pipeline, vapor recovery, gas transmission, fuel gas booster, and coal bed methane systems. We design and fabricate natural gas reciprocating and rotary compressor packages up to 8,000 horsepower for use in our service fleet and for sale to our broadened customer base. Our pump systems can be utilized in numerous applications including oil production, transfer, and pipelines as well as water injection and disposal.
The Compression Division's aftermarket business provides a wide range of services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment. These services include operations, maintenance, overhaul, and reconfiguration services, which may be provided under turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction contracts. This business employs factory trained sales and support personnel in most of the major oil and natural gas producing basins in the United States to perform these services.
Virtually all of our Compression Division's operations are conducted through our partially owned CSI Compressco LP subsidiary ("CCLP"). Through our wholly owned subsidiary, CSI Compressco GP Inc., we manage and control CCLP, and accordingly, we consolidate CCLP results of operation in our consolidated results of operation. As of December 31, 2016, common units held by the public represent approximately a 56% ownership interest in CCLP.
See “Note Q - Industry Segments and Geographic Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the Compression Division.
Offshore Division

Our Offshore Division consists of two operating segments: Offshore Services and Maritech. 
Offshore Services Segment. The Offshore Services segment provides: (1) downhole and subsea services such as well plugging and abandonment, and workover services; (2) decommissioning and certain construction services utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines; and (3) conventional and saturation diving services. We provide these services to offshore oil and gas operators, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We offer comprehensive, integrated services, including individualized engineering consultation and project management services.
In providing services, our Offshore Services segment utilizes rigless offshore plugging and abandonment equipment packages, two heavy lift barges, several dive support vessels, and other dive support assets that we own. In addition, we lease other assets from third parties and engage third-party contractors whenever necessary. The Offshore Services segment provides a wide variety of conventional and saturation diving services to its customers through its Epic Diving & Marine Services subsidiary ("EPIC"). Well abandonment, decommissioning, diving, and certain construction services are performed primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Offshore Services segment provides offshore cutting services and tool rentals through its EOT Cutting Services ("EOT") subsidiary. The Offshore Services segment also utilizes specialized equipment and engineering expertise to address a variety of specific platform construction and decommissioning issues, including those associated with platforms that have been toppled or severely damaged by hurricanes and other windstorms. The Offshore Services segment provides services to major oil and gas companies and independent operators, including Maritech, through its facilities located in Broussard, Belle Chasse, Fourchon, and Houma, Louisiana.

Our Offshore Services segment’s fleet of service vessels has expanded and contracted in size in recent years in response to changing demands for its services. With the TETRA Hedron, a 1,600-metric-ton heavy lift derrick barge, and the TETRA Arapaho, a 725-metric-ton heavy lift derrick barge [need to insert language regarding dry dock], we perform heavy lift decommissioning and construction projects and integrated operations on oil and gas production platforms. The Offshore Services segment also performs contract diving operations, utilizing its owned dive service vessels, as well as vessels obtained under long- and short-term leases as needed. Diving services include saturation diving for up to 1,000 foot dive depths as well as mixed gas and surface diving for shallower dives.
5

Among other factors, demand for our Offshore Service segment’s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is affected by federal regulations governing the abandonment and decommissioning of offshore wells, production platforms, and pipelines. These regulations include Notice To Lessees 2010-G05: “Decommissioning Guidance for Wells and Platforms” (NTL 2010-G05, known as the “Idle Iron Guidance”). The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") issues offshore permits, regulates offshore contractors, and oversees the provisions of the Idle Iron Guidance. The Idle Iron Guidance became effective October 15, 2010, and requires that operators perform and report decommissioning and abandonment plans and activities in accordance with BSEE requirements. The Idle Iron Guidance provides specific guidelines for when an operator has to permanently plug and abandon wells and decommission platforms and related facilities after the occurrence of certain events, including the end of useful operations, cessation of commercial production, and expiration of the lease.

Maritech Segment. The Maritech segment is a limited oil and gas production operation in the offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, Maritech sold substantially all of its proved reserves. Maritech’s remaining operations consist primarily of the ongoing abandonment and decommissioning of its remaining offshore wells, facilities, and production platforms. Maritech intends to acquire a significant portion of these services with regard to such assets that it operates from the Offshore Division’s Offshore Services segment.

The sales of substantially all of Maritech’s oil and gas producing properties during 2011 and 2012 have essentially removed us from the oil and gas exploration and production business, and significantly all of Maritech’s oil and gas acquisition, development, and exploitation activities have ceased. Following these sales, Maritech’s remaining oil and gas reserves and production are negligible. Maritech’s operations consist primarily of the well abandonment and decommissioning of its remaining offshore oil and gas platforms and facilities. During the three year period ended December 31, 2016, Maritech spent approximately $77.7 million on such efforts. Approximately $45.6 million of Maritech decommissioning liabilities remain as of December 31, 2016, and approximately $1.0 million of this amount is planned to be performed during 2017, with the timing of a portion of this work being discretionary.
Maritech’s decommissioning liabilities are established based on what it estimates a third party would charge to plug and abandon the wells, decommission the pipelines and platforms, and clear the sites associated with its properties. We review the adequacy of Maritech’s decommissioning liabilities whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liabilities have changed materially. The timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities being recorded. For a further discussion of Maritech’s adjustments to its decommissioning liabilities, see “Note I - Decommissioning and Other Asset Retirement Obligations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

See “Note Q - Industry Segments and Geographic Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the Offshore Division.

Sources of Raw Materials

Our Fluids Division manufactures calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide for sale to its customers. The Fluids Division also recycles used calcium bromide and zinc bromide CBFs repurchased from its oil and gas customers.

The Fluids Division manufactures liquid calcium chloride, either from underground brine or by reacting hydrochloric acid with limestone. The Fluids Division also purchases liquid and dry calcium chloride from a number of U.S. and foreign chemical manufacturers. Our El Dorado, Arkansas, plant produces liquid and flake calcium chloride, utilizing underground brine (tail brine) obtained from Chemtura Corporation ("Chemtura") that contains calcium chloride. We also produce calcium chloride at our two facility locations in San Bernardino County, California, by solar evaporation of pumped underground brine reserves that contain calcium chloride. The underground reserves of this brine are deemed adequate to supply our foreseeable need for calcium chloride at those plants.

The Fluids Division's primary sources of hydrochloric acid are co-product streams obtained from chemical manufacturers. Substantial quantities of limestone are also consumed when converting hydrochloric acid into calcium chloride. Currently, hydrochloric acid and limestone are generally available from multiple sources.

To produce calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide at our West Memphis, Arkansas, facility, we use bromine, hydrobromic acid, zinc, and lime as raw materials. There are multiple 
6

sources of zinc that we can use in the production of zinc bromide and zinc calcium bromide. We have a long-term supply agreement with Chemtura, under which the Fluids Division purchases its requirements of raw material bromine from Chemtura’s Arkansas bromine facilities. In addition, we have a long-term agreement with Chemtura under which Chemtura supplies the Fluids’ El Dorado, Arkansas, calcium chloride plant with raw material tail brine from its Arkansas bromine production facilities.

We also own a calcium bromide manufacturing plant near Magnolia, Arkansas that was constructed in 1985. This plant was acquired in 1988 and is not operable. We currently lease approximately 33,000 gross acres of bromine-containing brine reserves in the vicinity of this plant. While this plant is designed to produce calcium bromide, it could be modified to produce elemental bromine or select bromine compounds. Development of the brine field, construction of necessary pipelines, and reconfiguration of the plant would require a substantial capital investment. The long-term Chemtura bromine supply agreement discussed above provides us with a secure supply of bromine to support the division’s current operations. We do, however, continue to evaluate our strategy related to the Magnolia, Arkansas, assets and their future development. Chemtura has certain rights to participate in future development of the Magnolia, Arkansas assets.

The Fluids and Production Testing Divisions purchase their water management, production testing, and rig cooling equipment and components from third-party manufacturers. CCLP designs and fabricates its reciprocating and rotary screw compressor packages and pumps with components obtained from third party suppliers. These components represent a significant portion of the cost of the compressor packages and pump systems. Some of the components used in the assembly of compressor packages, well monitoring, sand separation, production testing, and rig cooling equipment are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We do not have long-term contracts with these suppliers or manufacturers. Should we experience unavailability of the components we use to assemble our equipment, we believe that there are adequate alternative suppliers and that any impact to us would not be severe. CCLP occasionally experiences long-lead times for components from suppliers and, therefore, may at times make purchases in anticipation of future orders.
Market Overview and Competition
Our operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for, and production of, natural gas and oil in the various domestic and international locations in which we operate. Beginning in 2014 and continuing throughout most of 2016, reduced prices of natural gas and oil led to declines in our customers' drilling activities and capital expenditure levels in the domestic and international markets in which we operate. The decline in activity in the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry resulted in reduced demand for certain of our products and services compared to early 2014 levels, which is expected to continue. With the increase in oil and gas pricing in the second half of 2016 and early 2017, we are seeing indicators of improving demand in the North America market, however the international and offshore markets downswing continues. 
Fluids Division

Our Fluids Division provides its products and services to oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States and certain foreign markets and to other customers that service such companies. Current areas of market presence include the onshore U.S., the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, Mexico, and certain countries in South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Customers with deepwater operations frequently utilize high volumes of CBFs, which can be subject to harsh downhole conditions, such as high pressure and high temperatures. Demand for CBF products offshore is generally driven by completion activity.

Since 2014, there has been increased industry demand for onshore water management services in unconventional shale gas and oil reservoirs in connection with hydraulic fracking operations. However, beginning in 2015, demand for certain Fluids Division products and services, particularly water management services, was adversely affected by declining oil and natural gas pricing and customer budgetary constraints. In mid-2016, demand for our North American onshore water management services increased as oil and natural gases prices rose. The Fluids Division provides water management services to a wide-range of onshore oil and gas operators located in all active North America unconventional oil and gas basins. 

Our Fluids Division’s principal competitors in the sale of CBFs to the oil and gas industry are Baker Hughes, Baroid, a subsidiary of Halliburton, and M-I Swaco, a subsidiary of Schlumberger. This market is highly competitive, and competition is based primarily on service, availability, and price. Major customers of the Fluids Division include Anadarko, Baker Hughes, Chesapeake, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, EOG Resources, ExxonMobil, 
7

Halliburton, LLOG Exploration, Oklahoma Energy Corp., Petrobras, Pioneer Natural Resources, Saudi Aramco, Schlumberger, Shell, Southwestern Energy, Total, Tullow, and W & T Offshore. The Fluids Division also sells its CBF products through various distributors. Competitors for the division’s water management services include large, multinational providers as well as small, privately owned operators.

Our liquid and dry calcium chloride products have a wide range of uses outside the energy industry. Non-energy market segments where these products are used include water treatment, industrial, food processing, road maintenance, ice melt, agricultural, and consumer products. We also sell sodium bromide into industrial water treatment markets as a biocide under the BioRid® tradename. Most of these markets are highly competitive. The Fluids Division’s European calcium chloride operations market our calcium chloride products to certain European markets. Our principal competitors in the non-energy related calcium chloride markets include Occidental Chemical Corporation and Vitro in North America and NedMag in Europe.

Production Testing Division 

Our Production Testing Division provides frac flowback services, early production facilities and services, production well testing services, offshore rig cooling services, and other associated services in various on-shore domestic and international locations. The Production Testing Division serves all active North America unconventional oil and gas basins. Through Greywolf, the division serves the western Canada market. In addition, through our OPTIMA subsidiary, the Production Testing Division offers offshore oil and gas rig cooling services and associated products that suppress heat generated by high-rate flaring of hydrocarbons during offshore well testing operations. OPTIMA primarily serves markets in the North Sea, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and South America. 
The U.S. and Canadian production testing markets are highly competitive, and competition is based on availability of appropriate equipment and qualified personnel, as well as price, quality of service, and safety record. We believe that our skilled personnel, operating procedures, and safety record give us a competitive advantage. The Production Testing Division plans to continue growing its foreign operations in order to serve major oil and gas markets worldwide. Competition in on-shore U.S. and Canadian production testing markets is primarily dominated by numerous small, privately owned operators. Expro International, Halliburton, and Schlumberger, are major competitors in the foreign markets we serve although, we provide these services to their customers on a subcontract basis from time to time. The major customers for this division include ConocoPhillips, Eclipse Resources, Encana, EP Energy, Expro, Peyto, Pioneer Natural Resources, Range Resources, Rice Energy, Saudi Aramco, Schlumberger, Shell, and Vantage Energy.
Compression Division
The Compression Division provides its products and services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies, operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. The Compression Division also has operations in Latin America and other foreign regions. While most of the Compression Division's services are performed throughout Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Midcontinent region of the United States, we also have a presence in other U.S. producing regions. The Compression Division continues to seek opportunities to further expand its operations into other regions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
This division’s strategy is to compete on the basis of superior services at a competitive price. The Compression Division believes that it is competitive because of the significant increases in the value that results from the use of its services, its superior customer service, its highly trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages it uses to provide services. The Compression Division’s major customers include Anadarko, Cimarex Energy, ConocoPhillips, Denbury Onshore, and Targa Resources.
The compression services and compressor package fabrication business is highly competitive. Certain of the Compression Division's competitors may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within the compression industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Primary competition for our low-horsepower compression services business comes from various local and regional companies that utilize packages consisting of a screw compressor with a separate engine driver or a reciprocating compressor with a separate engine driver. These local and regional competitors tend to compete with us on the basis of price as opposed to our focus on providing production enhancement value to the customer. Competition for the mid- and high-horsepower compression services business comes primarily from large national and multinational companies that may have greater financial resources than 
8

ours. Such competitors include ArchRock, AXIP Energy Services, CDM Resource Management, Exterran, CDM Resource Management, J-W Power, and USA Compression. Our competition in the standard compressor package fabrication and sales market includes several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators, including some of those who we compete with for compression services, as well as AG Equipment Company, Enerflex, SEC Energy Products & Services, and others. The Compression Division's competition in the custom-designed compressor package market usually consists of larger companies that have the ability to address integrated projects and provides product support after the sale. The ability to fabricate these large custom-designed packages at the Compression Division's facilities, which is near the point of end-use of many customers is often a competitive advantage.
Offshore Division

Offshore Services Segment. Demand for the Offshore Services segment’s offshore well abandonment and decommissioning services in the Gulf of Mexico is primarily driven by the maturity and decline of producing fields, aging offshore platform infrastructure, damage to platforms and pipelines from hurricanes and other windstorms, and government regulations, among other factors. Demand for the Offshore Services segment’s construction and other services is driven by the general level of offshore activity of its customers, which is affected by oil and natural gas prices and government regulation. We believe that the enforcement of government regulations, including the Idle Iron Guidance, may accelerate the pace at which offshore Gulf of Mexico abandonment and decommissioning will be done in the future. 

Offshore activities in the Gulf of Mexico are seasonal, with the majority of work occurring during the months of April through October when weather conditions are most favorable. Critical factors required to compete in this market include, among other factors: (i) the proper equipment, including vessels and heavy lift barges; (ii) qualified, experienced personnel; (iii) technical expertise to address varying downhole, surface, and subsea conditions, particularly those related to damaged wells and platforms; and (iv) a comprehensive health, safety, and environmental program. Our Offshore Services segment's fleet of owned equipment includes two heavy lift derrick barges, the TETRA Hedron, which has a 1,600-metric-ton lift capacity, fully revolving crane, and the TETRA Arapaho, which has a 725-metric-ton lift capacity. We believe that the integrated services that we offer and our vessel and equipment fleets satisfy current market requirements in the Gulf of Mexico and allow us to successfully compete in that market.

The Offshore Services segment markets its services primarily to major oil and gas companies and independent operators. One of the Offshore Services segment’s most significant customer historically has been Maritech; however, the amount of work performed for Maritech has been reduced in recent years and the amount of work to be performed in the future for Maritech is expected to continue to decline. Major customers include Chevron, Fieldwood Energy, Shell, Stone Energy, and W&T Offshore. The Offshore Services segment’s services are performed primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, however, the segment has provided services in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico and in the Asia-Pacific region and is seeking to expand its operations to international markets. Our principal competitors in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico market are Alliance Offshore, Montco Oilfield Contractors, Oceaneering, Offshore Specialty Fabricators, Inc., and Superior Energy Services, Inc. This market is highly competitive, and competition is based primarily on service, equipment availability, safety record, and price. 
No single customer provided 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Other Business Matters

Backlog

The Compression Division’s equipment sales business consist of the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield fluid pump systems that are fabricated to customer specifications and standard specifications, as applicable. The Division's custom-designed compressor packages are typically greater in size and complexity than standard fabrication packages, requiring more labor, materials, and overhead resources. This business requires diligent planning of those resources and project and backlog management in order to meet the customers' desired delivery dates and performance criteria, and achieve fabrication efficiencies. As of December 31, 2016, the Compression Division's equipment sales backlog was approximately $21.6 million, $19.4 million of which is expected to be recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017, based on title passing to the customer, the customer assuming the risks of ownership, reasonable assurance 
9

of collectability, and delivery occurring as directed by our customer. This backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist, and delivery has been scheduled. This backlog is a measure of marketing effectiveness that allows us to plan future labor and raw material needs and to measure our success in winning bids from our customers. 
Other than these Compression Division operations, our products and services generally are either not sold under long-term contracts or do not require long lead times to procure or deliver.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,400 employees. None of our U.S. employees are presently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our foreign employees are generally members of labor unions and associations in the countries in which they are employed. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Patents, Proprietary Technology and Trademarks

As of December 31, 2016, we owned or licensed fifty-one (51) issued U.S. patents and had thirteen (13) patent applications pending in the United States. We also had thirty-nine (39) owned or licensed patents and twenty-nine (29) patent applications pending in various other countries. The foreign patents and patent applications are primarily foreign counterparts to certain of our U.S. patents or patent applications. The issued patents expire at various times through 2035. We have elected to maintain certain other internally developed technologies, know-how, and inventions as trade secrets. While we believe that our patents and trade secrets are important to our competitive positions in our businesses, we do not believe any one patent or trade secret is essential to our success.

It is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with key employees, consultants, and third parties to whom we disclose our confidential and proprietary information, and we have typical policies and procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and expertise, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or expertise.

We sell various products and services under a variety of trademarks and service marks, some of which are registered in the United States or other countries.

Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations

We believe that our service and sales operations and manufacturing plants are in substantial compliance with all applicable U.S. and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. We are committed to conducting all of our operations under the highest standards of safety and respect for the environment. However, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in certain of our operations and in the development and handling of certain products and equipment produced or used at our plants, well locations, and worksites. Because of these risks, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Changes in environmental and health and safety regulations could subject us to more rigorous standards. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future regulatory and enforcement policies.
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to health, safety, and the environment, including regulations regarding air emissions, wastewater and storm water discharges, and the disposal of certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Compliance with laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities, and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or associated permits may result in the assessment of fines and penalties and the imposition of other obligations.

Our operations in the United States are subject to various evolving environmental laws and regulations that are enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"); the BSEE of the U.S. Department of the Interior; the U.S. Coast Guard; and various other federal, state, and local environmental authorities. Similar laws and regulations, designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors to our facilities, are enforced by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other state and local agencies and authorities. Specific environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations include: (i) the Federal Water 
10

Pollution Control Act of 1972; (ii) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976; (iii) the Clean Air Act of 1977; (iv) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"); (v) the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986; (vi) the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947; (vii) the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976; (viii) the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975; (ix) and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. Our operations outside the United States are subject to various foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, and other regulated activities in the countries in which we operate.

 The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, because they contribute to global warming and climate change. As a result, the EPA has begun to regulate certain sources of greenhouse gases, including air emissions associated with oil and gas production, particularly as they relate to the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas wells. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources which include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and gas processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. Reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. The EPA’s rules relating to emissions of greenhouse gases from large, stationary sources of emissions are currently subject to a number of legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent the EPA or state environmental agencies from implementing the rules. Further, Congress has considered, and almost one-half of the states have adopted, legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from a wide-range of sources.
Offshore Operations

During the past five years, several Notices to Lessees ("NTLs"), Safety and Environmental Management Systems ("SEMS") regulations, and other safety regulations implementing additional safety and certification requirements applicable to offshore activities in the Gulf of Mexico were issued. These NTLs and SEMS regulations include requirements by operators to:

• | submit well blowout prevention measures and contingency plans, including demonstrating access to subsea blowout containment resources;


• | abide by new permitting standards requiring detailed, independently certified descriptions of well design, casing, and cementing;


• | follow new performance-based standards for offshore drilling and production operations


• | enhance the safety of operations by reducing the frequency and severity of accidents; and


• | certify that the operator has complied with all regulations.


 The “Idle Iron Guidance” regulations, which were adopted in 2010 and govern the plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning of U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore wells and production platforms, are overseen by BSEE. This agency's scope of responsibility includes maintaining an investigation and review unit, providing for public forums, conducting comprehensive environmental analyses, and creating implementation teams to analyze various aspects of the regulatory structure and to help implement the reform agenda.

We maintain various types of insurance intended to reimburse us for certain costs in the event of an accident, including an explosion or similar event involving our offshore operations. Our insurance program is reviewed not less than annually with our insurance brokers and underwriters. As part of our insurance program for offshore operations, we maintain Commercial General Liability, Protection and Indemnity, and Excess Liability policies that provide third-party liability coverage, including but not limited to death and personal injury, collision, damage to property including fixed and floating objects, pollution, and wreck removal up to the applicable policy limits. Additionally, we maintain a vessel pollution liability policy that provides coverage for oil or hazardous substance pollution emanating from a vessel, addressing both Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") and CERCLA obligations. This policy also provides coverage for cost of defense, and limited coverage for fines, and penalties up to the applicable policy limits.

We provide services and products to customers in the Gulf of Mexico, generally pursuant to written master services agreements that create insurance and indemnity obligations for both parties. If there was an explosion or similar catastrophic event on an offshore location where we are providing services and products, under the majority of our master services agreements with our customers:

11


(1) | We would be required to indemnify our customer for any claims for injury, death, or property loss or destruction made against them by us or our subcontractors or our subcontractor’s employees. The customer would be required to indemnify us for any claims for injury, death, or property loss or destruction made against us by the customer or its other subcontractors or the employees of the customer or its other subcontractors. These indemnities are intended to apply regardless of the cause of such claims, including but not limited to, the negligence of the indemnified party. Our insurance is structured to cover the cost of defense and any resulting liability from all indemnified claims, up to policy limits.


(2) | The customer would be required to indemnify us for all claims for injury, death, or property loss or destruction made against us by a third party that arise out of the catastrophic event, regardless of the cause of such claims, including but not limited to, our negligence or our subcontractors’ negligence. Our insurance is structured to cover the cost of defense and any resulting liability from all such claims; however, our insurance would be applicable to the claim only if the customer defaulted or otherwise breached its indemnity obligations to us.


(3) | The customer would be required to indemnify us for all claims made against us for environmental pollution or contamination that arise out of the catastrophic event, regardless of the cause of such claims, including our negligence or the negligence of our subcontractors. Our insurance is structured to cover the cost of defense and any resulting liability from all such claims; however, our insurance would be applicable to the claim only if the customer defaulted or otherwise breached its indemnity obligations to us.

Following the 2011 and 2012 sales of substantially all of Maritech’s offshore producing properties, we no longer participate in offshore drilling activities. However, Maritech and our Offshore Services segment engage contractors to provide well abandonment and related services and products on Maritech’s remaining offshore oil and gas production platforms and associated wells, generally pursuant to written master services agreements that create insurance and indemnity obligations for both parties. If there was an environmental event on an offshore Maritech location where a Maritech contractor was providing services and products, under a majority of Maritech’s master services agreements with its contractors, Maritech would be required to indemnify its contractor for any claims against the contractor for injury, death, or property loss or destruction brought by Maritech, its other subcontractors, or its or their respective employees. The contractor would be required to indemnify Maritech for any claims for injury, death, or property loss or destruction made against Maritech by the contractor or its subcontractors or the employees of the contractor or its subcontractors. These indemnities would apply regardless of the cause of such claims, including the negligence of the indemnified party. Maritech’s insurance is structured to cover the cost of defense and any resulting liability from all indemnified claims, up to policy limits.

In accordance with applicable regulations, Maritech maintains an oil spill response plan with the BSEE and has designated contractors who are trained as qualified individuals and are prepared to coordinate a response to any spill or leak. Maritech also has contracts in place to assure that a complete and experienced resource team is available as required.
