ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
We are a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of Oklahoma, and our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol “OKE.” We are the sole general partner and, as of December 31, 2016, owned 41.2 percent of ONEOK Partners (NYSE: OKS), one of the largest publicly traded master limited partnerships. Our goal is to provide management and resources to ONEOK Partners, enabling it to execute its growth strategies and allowing us to grow our dividend. ONEOK Partners applies its core capabilities of gathering, processing, fractionating, transporting, storing and marketing natural gas and NGLs through the rebundling of services across the value chains through vertical integration in an effort to provide its customers with premium services at lower costs. ONEOK Partners is a leader in the gathering, processing, storage and transportation of natural gas in the United States. In addition, ONEOK Partners owns one of the nation’s premier natural gas liquids systems, connecting NGL supply in the Mid-Continent, Permian and Rocky Mountain regions with key market centers. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On January 31, 2017, we and ONEOK Partners entered into the Merger Agreement, by and among ONEOK, Merger Sub, ONEOK Partners and ONEOK Partners GP, the general partner of ONEOK Partners, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in ONEOK Partners not already directly or indirectly owned by us. Upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ONEOK Partners, with ONEOK Partners continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, in a taxable transaction to ONEOK Partners’ unitholders. For additional information on this transaction, see Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. 
ONEOK Partners operates predominantly fee-based businesses in each of its three reportable segments, and its consolidated earnings were approximately 88 percent fee-based in 2016. We continue to expect demand for ONEOK Partners’ midstream services to provide supply and market connectivity. We expect producers to require midstream services to connect production with end-use markets, increased demand for NGL products from the petrochemical industry and NGL exporters and increased demand for natural gas from power plants currently fueled by coal and natural gas exports to Mexico. While the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Liquids segments generate predominately fee-based earnings, those segments’ results of operations are exposed to volumetric risk. ONEOK Partners’ exposure to volumetric risk can result from reduced drilling activity, severe weather disruptions, operational outages and ethane rejection.

ONEOK Partners has available capacity on its integrated network of assets to grow fee-based earnings with minimal capital investment. We expect each of the three business segments to benefit from increasing producer activity in the Mid-Continent region from the highly productive STACK and SCOOP areas, where there was an increase in producer activity in late 2016, which we expect to continue in 2017. ONEOK Partners has a strong presence in the Mid-Continent region, with the Natural Gas Liquids segment’s gathering system serving as a primary NGL takeaway provider through connections to more than 100 third-party natural gas processing plants, the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s substantial acreage dedications in some of the most productive areas and the Natural Gas Pipelines segment’s broad footprint. In the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, ONEOK Partners has approximately 200 MMcf/d and 100 MMcf/d of available processing capacity in the Williston Basin and Oklahoma, respectively. As producers continue to develop the STACK and SCOOP areas, we expect natural gas and NGL volumes to increase in 2017, compared with 2016 volumes, and increased demand for ONEOK Partners’ services from producers that need incremental takeaway capacity for natural gas and NGLs out of the region.
The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s earnings were approximately 80 percent fee-based in 2016. Fee revenues averaged 76 cents per MMBtu, compared with an average of 44 cents per MMBtu in 2015 due to restructuring many of this segment’s POP with fee contracts to increase the fee component and reduce ONEOK Partners’ direct commodity price risk. To mitigate the impact of its remaining commodity price exposure, ONEOK Partners has hedged a significant portion of the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s commodity price risk for 2017 and 2018. This segment has substantial acreage dedications in some of the most productive areas of the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent region, specifically the STACK and SCOOP, which helps to mitigate the volumetric risk.
The Natural Gas Liquids segment’s earnings were approximately 90 percent fee-based in 2016. While ONEOK Partners is exposed to volumetric risk in this segment, this risk is partially mitigated through minimum volume commitments, which provide a minimum level of revenue regardless of the volumetric throughput. ONEOK Partners expects increasing demand from the petrochemical industry with the completion of ethylene production projects and NGL exports, which will require 
5

additional NGL transportation services that ONEOK Partners can provide without significant additional infrastructure needs or capital spending. 
The Natural Gas Pipelines segment’s earnings were approximately 95 percent fee-based in 2016, generated primarily from firm demand charge contracts. This segment continues to develop new projects to grow ONEOK Partners’ fee-based earnings, such as its Roadrunner joint venture and WesTex expansion project, both of which are fully subscribed with 25-year firm demand charge, fee-based agreements. We expect additional demand for ONEOK Partners’ services to deliver natural gas to power plants currently fueled by coal and to support increased demand for natural gas exports to Mexico, as well as provide market connectivity to supply basins.
See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information on our growth projects, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our primary business strategy is to maximize dividend payout while maintaining prudent financial strength and flexibility, with a focus on safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and legally compliant operations for our customers, employees, contractors and the public through the following:

• | Provide reliable energy and energy-related services in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner to our stakeholders through our ownership in ONEOK Partners - environmental, safety and health issues continue to be a primary focus for us, and our emphasis on personal and process safety has produced improvements in the key indicators we track. We also continue to look for ways to reduce our environmental impact by conserving resources and utilizing more efficient technologies; 


• | Maximize dividend payout while maintaining prudent financial strength and flexibility - during 2016, cash dividends paid per share and cash distributions received from ONEOK Partners increased compared to 2015. Our excess cash gives us flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to create additional shareholder value. We expect our dividend payout to increase following the completion of the Merger Transaction with ONEOK Partners. 


• | Attract, select, develop and retain a diverse group of employees to support strategy execution - we continue to execute on our recruiting strategy that targets professional and field personnel in our operating areas. We also continue to focus on employee development efforts with our current employees and monitor our benefits and compensation package to remain competitive. 

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
We report operations in the following business segments:

• | Natural Gas Gathering and Processing;


• | Natural Gas Liquids; and


• | Natural Gas Pipelines.

Natural Gas Gathering and Processing
Overview - The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment provides midstream services to contracted producers in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma. ONEOK Partners provides exploration and production companies with gathering and processing services that allow them to move their raw (unprocessed) natural gas to market. Raw natural gas is gathered, compressed and transported through pipelines to ONEOK Partners’ processing facilities. In order for the raw natural gas to be accepted by the downstream market, it must have contaminants, such as water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, removed and NGLs separated for further processing. Processed natural gas, usually referred to as residue natural gas, is then recompressed and delivered to natural gas pipelines and end users. The separated NGLs are in a mixed, unfractionated form and are sold and delivered through natural gas liquids pipelines to fractionation facilities for further separation.
Rocky Mountain region - The Williston Basin, located in portions of North Dakota and Montana, includes the oil-producing, NGL-rich Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations and is an active drilling region. ONEOK Partners’ completed growth projects, including its Bear Creek natural gas processing plant and infrastructure project that was completed in August 2016, have increased its gathering and processing capacity and allowed it to capture natural gas from new wells being drilled and natural gas previously flared by producers. 
6

The Powder River Basin is primarily located in Wyoming. This region includes the NGL-rich Niobrara Shale and Frontier, Turner and Sussex formations where ONEOK Partners provides gathering and processing services to customers in the southeast portion of Wyoming. 
Mid-Continent region - ONEOK Partners’ Mid-Continent region includes the NGL-rich STACK and SCOOP areas in the Anadarko Basin and the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Meramec, Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime formations of Oklahoma and Kansas; and the Hugoton and Central Kansas Uplift Basins of Kansas. Producers are actively drilling in the NGL-rich STACK and SCOOP areas where ONEOK Partners has substantial acreage dedicated to it.
Revenues - Revenues for this segment are derived primarily from the following types of contracts:

• | POP with fee-based components - Under this type of contract, ONEOK Partners charges fees for gathering, treating, compressing and processing the producer’s natural gas. ONEOK Partners also generally purchases the producer’s raw natural gas, which it processes into residue natural gas and NGLs, then it sells these commodities and associated condensate to downstream customers. ONEOK Partners remits sales proceeds to the producer according to the contractual terms and retains its portion. This type of contract represented approximately 94 percent and 90 percent of contracted volumes in this segment for 2016 and 2015, respectively. There are a variety of factors that directly affect ONEOK Partners’ POP with fee revenues, including: 


– | the price of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs;


– | the composition of the natural gas and NGLs produced;


– | the fees ONEOK Partners charges for its services; and


– | the volume produced.

Over time as ONEOK Partners’ contracts are renewed or restructured, it has generally increased the fee components. As a result, ONEOK Partners’ mix of commodity and fee-based earnings continues to change as volumes naturally decline on older contracts where it retains a higher percent of proceeds and volumes increase on contracts with higher fee components. Additionally, under certain POP with fee contracts ONEOK Partners’ fee revenues may increase or decrease if production volumes, delivery pressures or commodity prices change relative to specified thresholds.

• | Fee-only - Under this type of contract, ONEOK Partners is paid a fee for the services it provides, based on volumes gathered, processed, treated and/or compressed. ONEOK Partners’ fee-only contracts represented approximately 6 percent and 10 percent of contracted volumes in this segment for 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Property - The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment owns the following assets:

• | approximately 11,300 miles and 7,700 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions, respectively;


• | nine natural gas processing plants with approximately 785 MMcf/d of processing capacity in the Mid-Continent region, and 12 natural gas processing plants with approximately 1,045 MMcf/d of processing capacity in the Rocky Mountain region; and


• | approximately 15 MBbl/d of natural gas liquids fractionation capacity at various natural gas processing plants in the Rocky Mountain region.

Utilization - The utilization rates for ONEOK Partners’ natural gas processing plants were approximately 76 percent for both 2016 and 2015. ONEOK Partners calculates utilization rates using a weighted-average approach, adjusting for the dates that assets were placed in service.
Unconsolidated Affiliates - The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:

• | 49 percent ownership in Bighorn Gas Gathering, which operates a coal-bed methane gathering system in the Powder River Basin;


• | 37 percent ownership in Fort Union Gas Gathering, which gathers coal-bed methane produced in the Powder River Basin and delivers it to the interstate pipeline system;


• | 35 percent ownership interest in Lost Creek Gathering Company, which gathers natural gas produced from conventional dry natural gas wells in the Wind River Basin of central Wyoming and delivers it to the interstate pipeline system; and


• | 10 percent ownership interest in Venice Energy Services Co., a natural gas processing facility near Venice, Louisiana.

See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our unconsolidated affiliates.

Market Conditions and Seasonality - Supply - Rocky Mountain region - In the Williston Basin, natural gas volumes continued to grow in 2016, driven primarily by producer development of Bakken Shale crude oil wells, which also produce associated natural gas containing significant quantities of NGLs. The number of well connections in 2016 decreased, compared with 2015, due to reduced drilling and completion activity by producers and continued low commodity prices. ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathered and processed volumes in the Williston Basin increased in 2016, compared with 2015, despite the reductions in producer drilling activity, due to the following:

• | capturing additional natural gas previously flared by producers through natural gas compression and processing capacity placed in service in late 2015 and projects completed in 2016;


• | producers focusing their drilling and completion in the most productive areas where ONEOK Partners has significant gathering and processing assets, which typically produce at higher initial production rates compared with other areas and have higher natural gas to oil ratios; and


• | continued improvements in production by producers due to enhanced completion techniques and more efficient drilling rigs.

In 2017, we expect volume growth in the Williston Basin from the projects and production activities discussed above to be partially offset by natural production declines. 
Mid-Continent region - In the Mid-Continent region, ONEOK Partners has significant natural gas gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma and Kansas. With the emerging STACK and SCOOP areas, we anticipate increased producer activity in the Mid-Continent, where ONEOK Partners has substantial acreage dedications in these productive areas. We expect ONEOK Partners’ average natural gas volumes to grow in 2017 due to continued drilling and completion activity, offset partially by the natural volume declines from existing wells connected to ONEOK Partners’ system.
Demand - Demand for gathering and processing services is dependent on natural gas production by producers, which is driven by the strength of the economy; natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices; and the demand for each of these products from end users. The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment’s customers are generally crude oil and natural gas producers who have proven reserves or are currently producing natural gas in areas within ONEOK Partners’ existing infrastructure and need gathering and processing services. Additionally, demand is impacted by the weather, which is discussed below under “Seasonality.”
Rocky Mountain region - Demand for ONEOK Partners’ gathering and processing services in the Williston Basin has remained strong even as crude oil prices remained low. Requirements in North Dakota for producers to reduce natural gas flaring have increased the need for ONEOK Partners’ services to capture, gather and process this natural gas. ONEOK Partners has approximately 200 MMcf/d of available processing capacity in the Williston Basin.
Mid-Continent region - As producers continue to develop the STACK and SCOOP areas of the Anadarko Basin, we expect increased demand for ONEOK Partners’ services from producers. ONEOK Partners has approximately 100 MMcf/d of available processing capacity in Oklahoma.
Commodity Prices - While ONEOK Partners has significantly reduced its direct exposure to commodity prices in this segment and its earnings are primarily fee-based, the commodity price environment has resulted in a reduction of producer drilling activity and well completions in 2016 and 2015.
See discussion regarding our commodity price risk and related hedging activities under “Commodity Price Risk” in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Seasonality - Cold temperatures usually increase demand for natural gas and certain NGL products such as propane, the main heating fuels for homes and businesses. Warm temperatures usually increase demand for natural gas used in gas-fired electric generators for residential and commercial cooling, as well as agriculture-related equipment like irrigation pumps and crop dryers. During periods of peak demand for a certain commodity, prices for that product typically increase.
Extreme weather conditions and seasonal temperature changes impact the volumes and composition of natural gas gathered and processed. Freeze-offs are a phenomenon where water produced with natural gas freezes at the wellhead or within the gathering system. This causes a temporary interruption in the flow of natural gas. All of ONEOK Partners’ operations may be affected by other weather conditions that may cause a loss of electricity at ONEOK Partners’ facilities or prevent access to certain locations that affect a producer’s ability to complete wells or ONEOK Partners’ ability to connect those wells to its systems.
8

Competition - ONEOK Partners competes for natural gas supply with major integrated oil companies, independent exploration and production companies that have gathering and processing assets, pipeline companies and their affiliated marketing companies, and other midstream gatherers and processors. The factors that typically affect ONEOK Partners’ ability to compete for natural gas supply are:

• | quality of services provided;


• | producer drilling activity;


• | proceeds remitted and/or fees charged under its gathering and processing contracts;


• | location of its gathering systems relative to those of its competitors;


• | location of its gathering systems relative to drilling activity;


• | operating pressures maintained on its gathering systems;


• | efficiency and reliability of its operations;


• | delivery capabilities for natural gas and NGLs that exist in each system and plant location; and


• | cost of capital.

Competition for natural gas gathering and processing services continues to increase as new infrastructure projects are completed to address increased production from shale and other resource areas. In response to these changing industry conditions, ONEOK Partners continues to evaluate opportunities to increase earnings and cash flows, and reduce risk by:

• | improving natural gas processing efficiency;


• | reducing operating costs;


• | consolidating assets;


• | decreasing commodity price exposure; and


• | restructuring low-margin contracts.

Customers - ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathering and processing customers include both large integrated and independent exploration and production companies. See discussion regarding ONEOK Partners’ customer credit risk under “Counterparty Credit Risk” in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Government Regulation - The FERC traditionally has maintained that a natural gas processing plant is not a facility for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce and, therefore, is not subject to jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act. Although the FERC has made no specific declaration as to the jurisdictional status of ONEOK Partners’ natural gas processing operations or facilities, its natural gas processing plants are primarily involved in extracting NGLs and, therefore, are exempt from FERC jurisdiction. The Natural Gas Act also exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. We believe ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathering facilities and operations meet the criteria used by the FERC for nonjurisdictional natural gas gathering facility status. Interstate transmission facilities remain subject to FERC jurisdiction. The FERC has historically distinguished between these two types of facilities, either interstate or intrastate, on a fact-specific basis. ONEOK Partners transports residue natural gas from its natural gas processing plants to interstate pipelines in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act. Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota also have statutes regulating, to varying degrees, the gathering of natural gas in those states. In each state, regulation is applied on a case-by-case basis if a complaint is filed against the gatherer with the appropriate state regulatory agency.
See further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.
Natural Gas Liquids
Overview - The Natural Gas Liquids segment owns and operates facilities that gather, fractionate, treat and distribute NGLs and store NGL products, primarily in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and the Rocky Mountain region where it provides midstream services to producers of NGLs and delivers those products to the two primary market centers, one in the Mid-Continent in Conway, Kansas, and the other in the Gulf Coast in Mont Belvieu, Texas. This segment owns or has an ownership interest in FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado, and terminal and storage facilities in Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois. ONEOK Partners also owns FERC-regulated natural gas liquids distribution and refined petroleum products pipelines in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana that connect its Mid-Continent assets with Midwest markets, including Chicago, Illinois. The majority of the pipeline-connected natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas Panhandle are connected to its gathering systems. ONEOK Partners owns and operates truck- and rail-loading and -unloading facilities connected to its natural gas liquids fractionation and pipeline assets.
Most natural gas produced at the wellhead contains a mixture of NGL components, such as ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline. The NGLs that are separated from the natural gas stream at natural gas processing plants remain in 
9

a mixed, unfractionated form until they are gathered, primarily by pipeline, and delivered to fractionators where the NGLs are separated into NGL products. These NGL products are then stored or distributed to the Natural Gas Liquids segment’s customers, such as petrochemical manufacturers, heating fuel users, ethanol producers, refineries, exporters and propane distributors. 
Revenues for the Natural Gas Liquids segment are derived primarily from fee-based services that ONEOK Partners provides to its customers and from the physical optimization of its assets. This segment also purchases NGLs and condensate from third parties, as well as from the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. This segment’s fee-based services have increased due primarily to new supply connections, expansion of existing connections and the completion of capital-growth projects. This segment’s business activities are categorized as exchange services, transportation and storage services, and optimization and marketing, which are defined as follows:

• | ONEOK Partners’ exchange services utilize its assets to gather, fractionate and/or treat, and transport unfractionated NGLs, thereby converting them into marketable NGL products shipped to a market center or customer-designated location. Many of these exchange volumes are under contracts with minimum volume commitments that provide a minimum level of revenues regardless of volumetric throughput. ONEOK Partners’ exchange services activities are primarily fee-based and include some rate-regulated tariffs; however, it also captures certain product price differentials through the fractionation process. 


• | ONEOK Partners’ transportation and storage services include the transport of NGL products and refined petroleum products, primarily under FERC-regulated tariffs. Tariffs specify the maximum rates ONEOK Partners may charge its customers and the general terms and conditions for NGL transportation service on its pipelines. ONEOK Partners’ storage activities consist primarily of fee-based NGL storage services at its Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast storage facilities. 


• | ONEOK Partners’ optimization and marketing activities utilize its assets, contract portfolio and market knowledge to capture location, product and seasonal price differentials. ONEOK Partners primarily transports NGL products between Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, to capture the location price differentials between the two market centers. ONEOK Partners’ marketing activities also include utilizing its natural gas liquids storage facilities to capture seasonal price differentials. A growing portion of ONEOK Partners’ marketing activities serves truck and rail markets. ONEOK Partners’ isomerization activities capture the price differential when normal butane is converted into the more valuable iso-butane at its isomerization unit in Conway, Kansas. 

Supply growth from the development of NGL-rich areas and increased capacity available on pipelines that connect the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast resulted in NGL price differentials remaining narrow between the Mid-Continent market center at Conway, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast market center at Mont Belvieu, Texas. We expect these narrow price differentials to persist between these two market centers until demand for NGLs increases from petrochemical companies and exporters, which we anticipate to begin in the second half of 2017.
Property - The Natural Gas Liquids segment owns the following assets:

• | approximately 2,800 miles of non-FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines with peak capacity of approximately 800 MBbl/d;


• | approximately 170 miles of non-FERC-regulated natural gas liquids distribution pipelines with peak transportation capacity of approximately 66 MBbl/d;


• | approximately 4,300 miles of FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines with peak capacity of approximately 683 MBbl/d;


• | approximately 4,200 miles of FERC-regulated natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products distribution pipelines with peak capacity of 993 MBbl/d;


• | one natural gas liquids fractionator in Oklahoma with operating capacity of approximately 210 MBbl/d, two natural gas liquids fractionators in Kansas with combined operating capacity of 280 MBbl/d and two natural gas liquids fractionators in Texas with combined operating capacity of 150 MBbl/d;


• | 80 percent ownership interest in one natural gas liquids fractionator in Texas with ONEOK Partners’ proportional share of operating capacity of approximately 128 MBbl/d;


• | interest in one natural gas liquids fractionator in Kansas with ONEOK Partners’ proportional share of operating capacity of approximately 11 MBbl/d;


• | one isomerization unit in Kansas with operating capacity of 9 MBbl/d;


• | six natural gas liquids storage facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with operating storage capacity of approximately 22.2 MMBbl;


• | eight natural gas liquids product terminals in Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois;


• | above- and below-ground storage facilities associated with ONEOK Partners’ FERC-regulated natural gas liquids pipeline operations in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and Kansas with combined operating capacity of 978 MBbl; and

10


• | one ethane/propane splitter in Texas with operating capacity of 32 MBbl/d of purity ethane and 8 MBbl/d of propane.

In addition, ONEOK Partners leases approximately 3.0 MMBbl of combined NGL storage capacity at facilities in Kansas and Texas and has access to 60 MBbl/d of natural gas liquids fractionation capacity in Texas through a fractionation service agreement.
Utilization - The utilization rates for ONEOK Partners’ various assets, including leased assets, have been impacted by ethane rejection. The utilization rates for 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows:

• | its non-FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines were approximately 66 percent and 65 percent;


• | its FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines were approximately 77 percent and 75 percent;


• | its FERC-regulated natural gas liquids distribution pipelines were approximately 56 percent and 43 percent; and


• | its natural gas liquids fractionators were approximately 70 percent and 66 percent.

ONEOK Partners calculates utilization rates using a weighted-average approach, adjusting for the dates that assets were placed in service. ONEOK Partners’ fractionation utilization rate reflects approximate proportional capacity associated with its ownership interests.
Unconsolidated Affiliates - The Natural Gas Liquids segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:

• | 50 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which operates an interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system extending approximately 760 miles, originating in Wyoming and Colorado and terminating in Kansas;


• | 50 percent ownership interest in Chisholm Pipeline Company, which operates an interstate natural gas liquids pipeline system extending approximately 185 miles from origin points in Oklahoma and terminating in Kansas; and


• | 50 percent ownership interest in Heartland Pipeline Company, which operates a terminal and pipeline system that transports refined petroleum products in Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa.

See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of unconsolidated affiliates.
Market Conditions and Seasonality - Supply - The unfractionated NGLs that ONEOK Partners gathers and transports originate primarily from natural gas processing plants connected to ONEOK Partners’ gathering systems in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and the Rocky Mountain region. The Natural Gas Liquids segment is connected to more than 100 third-party natural gas processing plants in the Mid-Continent region, is one of the primary NGL takeaway providers for the emerging STACK and SCOOP areas and is one of the primary takeaway providers for the Williston Basin with the Bakken NGL Pipeline. ONEOK Partners’ fractionation operations receive NGLs from a variety of processors and pipelines, including its affiliates, located in these regions. Supply for the Natural Gas Liquids segment depends on crude oil and natural gas drilling and production activities by producers, the decline rate of existing production, natural gas processing plant economics and capabilities, and the NGL content of the natural gas that is produced and processed in the areas in which ONEOK Partners operates.
Supply growth has resulted in available ethane supplies that are greater than the petrochemical industry’s current demand. As a result, low or unprofitable price differentials between ethane and natural gas have resulted in ethane rejection at most of ONEOK Partners’ and its customers’ natural gas processing plants connected to its natural gas liquids gathering system in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions, which reduced the ethane component of natural gas liquids volumes gathered, fractionated, transported and sold across its assets. Through ethane rejection, natural gas processors leave some of the ethane component in the natural gas stream sold at the tailgate of natural gas processing plants. Ethane rejection levels by natural gas processors delivering to ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids gathering system have continued to fluctuate, averaging approximately 175 MBbl/d in 2016. While the volume of ethane produced increased modestly during 2016, compared with 2015, a portion of the fees associated with those volumes gathered and fractionated was previously being earned under contracts with minimum volume obligations. We expect ethane rejection levels to continue to fluctuate in 2017 as the market begins to balance ethane supply and demand and as the price differentials between ethane and natural gas change. We expect ethane recovery levels to increase as ethylene producers and NGL exporters increase their capacity to consume and export additional ethane volumes. Expansion of the petrochemical industry in the United States is expected to increase ethane demand in the second half of 2017. International demand for NGLs, particularly ethane and propane, also is expected to increase.
Demand - Demand for NGLs and the ability of natural gas processors to successfully and economically sustain their operations affect the volume of unfractionated NGLs produced by natural gas processing plants, thereby affecting the demand for NGL gathering, fractionation and transportation services. Natural gas and propane are subject to weather-related seasonal demand. Other NGL products are affected by economic conditions and the demand associated with the various industries that utilize the 
11

commodity, such as butanes and natural gasoline used by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, denaturant for ethanol and diluents for crude oil. Ethane, propane, normal butane and natural gasoline are used by the petrochemical industry to produce chemical products, such as plastic, rubber and synthetic fibers. Several petrochemical companies are constructing new plants, plant expansions, additions or enhancements that improve the light-NGL feed capability of their facilities due primarily to the increased supply and attractive price of ethane, compared with crude oil-based alternatives, as a petrochemical feedstock in the United States. The demand is expected to increase beginning in the second half of 2017 when many of the new petrochemical plants and plant modifications are expected to be completed. In addition, we expect increased international demand for ethane, propane and butane to provide opportunities to increase fee-based earnings in ONEOK Partners’ exchange and storage services and marketing activities.
Commodity Prices - The Natural Gas Liquids segment provides primarily fee-based services. However, ONEOK Partners is exposed to market risk associated with changes in the price of NGLs; the location differential between the Mid-Continent, Chicago, Illinois, and Gulf Coast regions; and the relative price differential between natural gas, NGLs and individual NGL products, which affect its NGL purchases and sales, and its exchange, storage, transportation, optimization and marketing financial results. Supply growth from the development of NGL-rich areas and increased capacity available on pipelines that connect the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast market centers resulted in NGL price differentials remaining narrow between the Mid-Continent market center at Conway, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast market center at Mont Belvieu, Texas. NGL storage revenue may be affected by price volatility and forward pricing of NGL physical contracts versus the price of NGLs on the spot market.
Seasonality - ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids fractionation and pipeline operations typically experience some seasonal variation. Some NGL products stored and transported through ONEOK Partners’ assets are subject to weather-related seasonal demand, such as propane, which can be used for heating during the winter and for agricultural purposes such as crop drying in the fall. Demand for butanes and natural gasoline, which are primarily used by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, denaturant for ethanol and diluents for crude oil, may also be subject to some variability during seasonal periods when certain government restrictions on motor fuel blending products change. The ability of natural gas processors to produce NGLs also is affected by weather. Extreme weather conditions and ground temperature changes impact the volumes of natural gas gathered and processed and NGL volumes gathered, transported and fractionated. Power interruptions, inaccessible well sites as a result of storms or freeze-offs, a phenomenon where water produced from natural gas freezes at the wellhead or within the gathering system, cause a temporary interruption in the flow of natural gas and NGLs.
Competition - The Natural Gas Liquids segment competes with other fractionators, intrastate and interstate pipeline companies, storage providers, and gatherers and transporters for NGL supply in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions. The factors that typically affect ONEOK Partners’ ability to compete for NGL supply are:

• | quality of services provided;


• | producer drilling activity;


• | the petrochemical industry’s level of capacity utilization and feedstock requirements;


• | fees charged under its contracts;


• | current and forward NGL prices;


• | location of its gathering systems relative to its competitors;


• | location of its gathering systems relative to drilling activity;


• | proximity to NGL supply areas and markets;


• | efficiency and reliability of its operations;


• | receipt and delivery capabilities that exist in each pipeline system, plant, fractionator and storage location; and


• | cost of capital.

ONEOK Partners has responded to these factors by making capital investments to access new supplies; increasing gathering, fractionation and distribution capacity; increasing storage, withdrawal and injection capabilities; and reducing operating costs so that it may compete effectively. ONEOK Partners’ competitors continue to invest in natural gas liquids pipeline and fractionation infrastructure to address the growing NGL supply and petrochemical demand. As ONEOK Partners’ growth projects and those of its competitors have alleviated constraints between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast NGL market centers, we expect the narrow location price differentials between the two locations to continue. In addition, ONEOK Partners’ competitors’ natural gas liquids infrastructure projects provide NGL supply from the Rocky Mountain, Marcellus and Utica basins into the Gulf Coast market center, which affects NGL prices and competes with and could displace NGL supply volumes from the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions where ONEOK Partners’ assets are located. We believe ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids fractionation, pipelines and storage assets are located strategically, connecting diverse supply areas to market centers.
12

Customers - The Natural Gas Liquids segment’s customers are primarily NGL and natural gas gathering and processing companies; major and independent crude oil and natural gas production companies; propane distributors; ethanol producers; and petrochemical, refining and NGL marketing companies. See discussion regarding ONEOK Partners’ customer credit risk under “Counterparty Credit Risk” in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Government Regulation - The operations and revenues of ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids pipelines are regulated by various state and federal government agencies. Its interstate natural gas liquids pipelines are regulated by the FERC, which has authority over the terms and conditions of service; rates, including depreciation and amortization policies; and initiation of service. In Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, certain aspects of ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas liquids pipelines that provide common carrier service are subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, KCC and RRC, respectively.
PHMSA has asserted jurisdiction over certain portions of ONEOK Partners’ fractionation facilities in Bushton, Kansas, that it believes are subject to its jurisdiction. ONEOK Partners has objected to the scope of PHMSA’s jurisdiction and is seeking resolution of this matter. ONEOK Partners does not anticipate that the cost of compliance will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
See further discussion in the “Regulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters” section.
Natural Gas Pipelines
Overview - The Natural Gas Pipelines segment provides transportation and storage services to end users through ONEOK Partners’ wholly owned assets and its 50 percent ownership interests in Northern Border Pipeline and Roadrunner. Phase I and Phase II of the Roadrunner pipeline were completed in March and October 2016, respectively.
Interstate Pipelines - ONEOK Partners’ interstate pipelines are regulated by the FERC and are located in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico. ONEOK Partners’ interstate pipeline companies include:

• | Midwestern Gas Transmission, which is a bidirectional system that interconnects with Tennessee Gas Transmission Company’s pipeline near Portland, Tennessee, and with several interstate pipelines that have access to both the Utica Shale and the Marcellus Shale at the Chicago Hub near Joliet, Illinois;


• | Viking Gas Transmission, which is a bidirectional system that interconnects with a TransCanada Corporation pipeline at the United States border near Emerson, Canada, and ANR Pipeline Company near Marshfield, Wisconsin;


• | Guardian Pipeline, which interconnects with several pipelines at the Chicago Hub near Joliet, Illinois, and with local natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin; and


• | OkTex Pipeline, which has interconnections with several pipelines in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.

Intrastate Pipelines - ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas pipeline assets in Oklahoma transport natural gas through the state and have access to the major natural gas production areas in the Mid-Continent region, which include the emerging STACK and SCOOP areas in the Anadarko Basin and the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Meramec, Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime formations. ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas pipeline assets in Oklahoma serve end-use markets, such as local distribution companies and power generation companies. In Texas, ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas pipelines are connected to the major natural gas producing formations in the Texas Panhandle, including the Granite Wash formation and Delaware and Cline producing formations in the Permian Basin. These pipelines are capable of transporting natural gas throughout the western portion of Texas, including the Waha Hub where other pipelines may be accessed for transportation to western markets, exports to Mexico, the Houston Ship Channel market to the east and the Mid-Continent market to the north. ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas pipeline assets also have access to the Hugoton and Central Kansas Uplift Basins in Kansas.
The Roadrunner pipeline transports natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas, and is fully subscribed with 25-year firm demand charge, fee-based agreements. The Roadrunner pipeline connects with ONEOK Partners’ existing natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure in Texas and, together with its WesTex intrastate natural gas pipeline expansion project, creates a platform for future opportunities to deliver natural gas supply to Mexico. If tariffs, border taxes or other measures assessed on cross-border transactions with Mexico are implemented, we do not expect them to materially impact ONEOK Partners or Roadrunner. Roadrunner’s long-term firm demand transportation service contracts provide markets in Mexico access to upstream supply basins in West Texas and the Mid-Continent region, which adds location and price diversity to their supply mix and supports the plan of Mexico’s national electric utility, Comisión Federal de Electricidad, to replace oil-fueled power plants with natural gas-fueled power plants, which are more economical and produce fewer GHG emissions.
13

Transportation Rates - ONEOK Partners’ transportation contracts for its regulated natural gas services are based upon rates stated in the respective tariffs. The tariffs provide both the general terms and conditions for the facilities and the maximum allowed rates customers can be charged by type of service, which may be discounted to meet competition if necessary. The rates are established at FERC or the appropriate state jurisdictional agencies. The earnings are primarily fee-based from the following types of services:

• | Firm service - Customers reserve a fixed quantity of pipeline capacity for a specified period of time, which obligates the customer to pay regardless of usage. Under this type of contract, the customer pays a monthly fixed fee and incremental fees, known as commodity charges, which are based on the actual volumes of natural gas they transport or store. In addition, ONEOK Partners may retain a percentage of fuel in-kind based on the volumes of natural gas transported. Under the firm service contract, the customer generally is guaranteed access to the capacity they reserve. 


• | Interruptible service - Under interruptible service transportation agreements, the customer may utilize available capacity after firm service requests are satisfied. The customer is not guaranteed use of ONEOK Partners’ pipelines unless excess capacity is available. Customers typically are assessed fees, such as a commodity charge, and ONEOK Partners may retain a specified volume of natural gas in-kind based on their actual usage. 

Storage - ONEOK Partners owns natural gas storage facilities located in Texas and Oklahoma that are connected to its intrastate natural gas pipelines. It also has underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas. In Texas and Kansas, natural gas storage operations may be regulated by the state in which the facility operates and by the FERC for certain types of services. In Oklahoma, natural gas storage operations are not subject to rate regulation by the state and have market-based rate authority from the FERC for certain types of services.
Storage Rates - The earnings are primarily fee-based from the following types of services:

• | Firm service - Customers reserve a specific quantity of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and generally pay fixed fees based on the quantity of capacity reserved plus an injection and withdrawal fee. Firm storage contracts typically have terms longer than one year. 


• | Park-and-loan service - An interruptible service offered to customers providing the ability to park (inject) or loan (withdraw) natural gas into or out of storage, typically for monthly or seasonal terms. Customers reserve the right to park or loan natural gas based on a specified quantity, including injection and withdrawal rights when capacity is available. 

Property - The Natural Gas Pipelines segment owns the following assets:

• | approximately 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines with approximately 3.5 Bcf/d of peak transportation capacity;


• | approximately 5,200 miles of state-regulated intrastate transmission pipelines with peak transportation capacity of approximately 3.4 Bcf/d; and


• | approximately 57.8 Bcf of total active working natural gas storage capacity.

ONEOK Partners’ storage includes three underground natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma, two underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas and two underground natural gas storage facilities in Texas.
Utilization - ONEOK Partners’ natural gas pipelines were approximately 92 percent subscribed in both 2016 and 2015, and its natural gas storage facilities were 65 percent subscribed in 2016 and 71 percent subscribed in 2015.
Unconsolidated Affiliates - The Natural Gas Pipelines segment includes the following unconsolidated affiliates:

• | 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, which owns a FERC-regulated interstate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Montana-Saskatchewan border near Port of Morgan, Montana, and the Williston Basin in North Dakota to a terminus near North Hayden, Indiana.


• | 50 percent interest in Roadrunner, which has the capacity to transport approximately 570 MMcf/d of natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas. ONEOK Partners is the operator of Roadrunner. 

See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of unconsolidated affiliates.
14

Market Conditions and Seasonality - Supply - The development of natural gas produced from shale resource areas has continued to increase available supply across North America and has caused location and seasonal price differentials to narrow in the regions where ONEOK Partners operates.
Interstate - Guardian Pipeline, Midwestern Gas Transmission and Viking Gas Transmission access supply from the major producing regions of the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountains, Canada, Gulf Coast and the Northeast. The current supply of natural gas for Northern Border Pipeline is primarily sourced from Canada; however, as the Williston Basin supply area has developed, more natural gas supply from this area is being transported on Northern Border Pipeline to markets near Chicago. In addition, supply volumes from nontraditional natural gas production areas, such as the Marcellus and Utica shale areas in the Northeast, may compete with and displace volumes from the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain and Canadian supply sources in ONEOK Partners’ markets. Factors that may impact the supply of Canadian natural gas transported by ONEOK Partners’ pipelines are primarily the availability of United States supply, Canadian natural gas available for export, Canadian storage capacity, government regulation and demand for Canadian natural gas in Canada and United States consumer markets.
Intrastate and Storage - ONEOK Partners’ intrastate pipelines and storage assets may be impacted by the pace of drilling activity by crude oil and natural gas producers and the decline rate of existing production in the major natural gas production areas in the Mid-Continent region, which include the emerging STACK and SCOOP areas in the Anadarko Basin, the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Meramec, Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime formations, Hugoton Basin and Central Kansas Uplift Basin. 
Demand - Demand for services is related directly to ONEOK Partners’ access to supply and the demand for natural gas by the markets that its natural gas pipelines and storage facilities serve. Demand is also affected by weather, the economy, natural gas price volatility and regulatory changes.

• | Weather - The effect of weather on its natural gas pipelines operations is discussed below under “Seasonality.”


• | Economy - The strength of the economy directly impacts manufacturing and industrial companies that consume natural gas.


• | Price volatility - Commodity price volatility can influence producers’ decisions related to the production of natural gas. ONEOK Partners’ pipeline customers, primarily natural gas and electric utilities, require natural gas to operate their businesses and generally are not impacted by location price differentials. However, narrower location price differentials may impact demand for the segment’s services from natural gas marketers as discussed below under “Commodity Prices.” 


• | Regulatory - Demand for this segment’s services is also affected as coal-fired electric generators are retired and replaced with power generation from natural gas. EPA regulations on emissions from coal-fired electric-generation plants, including the Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, have increased the demand for natural gas as a fuel for electric generation, as well as related transportation and storage services. The demand for natural gas and related transportation and storage services is expected to increase over the next several years as these regulations continue to be implemented. 

Commodity Prices - As a result of excess supplies of natural gas and the addition of natural gas infrastructure, the natural gas location and seasonal price differentials have remained narrow across the regions where ONEOK Partners operates. Although ONEOK Partners’ revenues are primarily fee-based, commodity prices can affect its results of operations.

• | Transportation - ONEOK Partners is exposed to market risk through interruptible contracts or when existing firm contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation with customers that have competitive alternatives.


• | Storage - Natural gas storage revenue is impacted by the differential between forward pricing of natural gas physical contracts and the price of natural gas on the spot market.


• | Fuel - ONEOK Partners’ fuel costs and the value of the retained fuel in-kind received for its services also are impacted by changes in the price of natural gas.

Seasonality - Demand for natural gas is seasonal. Weather conditions throughout North America may significantly impact regional natural gas supply and demand. High temperatures may increase demand for gas-fired electric generation needed to meet the electricity demand required to cool residential and commercial properties. Cold temperatures may lead to greater demand for ONEOK Partners’ transportation services due to increased demand for natural gas to heat residential and commercial properties. Low precipitation levels may impact the demand for natural gas that is used to fuel irrigation activity in the Mid-Continent region.
To the extent that pipeline capacity is contracted under firm-service transportation agreements, revenue, which is generated primarily from fixed-fee charges, is not significantly impacted by seasonal throughput variations. However, when transportation agreements expire, seasonal demand may affect the value of firm-service transportation capacity.
15

Natural gas storage is necessary to balance the relatively steady natural gas supply with the seasonal demand of residential, commercial and electric-generation users. The majority of ONEOK Partners’ storage capacity is either contracted under firm-service agreements or is used for park-and-loan services. ONEOK Partners retains a portion of its storage capacity for operational purposes.
Competition - ONEOK Partners’ natural gas pipelines and storage facilities compete directly with other intrastate and interstate pipeline companies and other storage facilities. Competition among pipelines and natural gas storage facilities is based primarily on fees for services, quality and reliability of services provided, current and forward natural gas prices, proximity to natural gas supply areas and markets, and access to capital. Competition for natural gas transportation services continues to increase as new infrastructure projects are completed and the FERC and state regulatory bodies continue to encourage more competition in the natural gas markets. Regulatory bodies also are encouraging the use of natural gas for electric generation that has traditionally been fueled by coal. The combined cost of coal and the associated rail transportation continues to be competitive with the cost of natural gas; however, the clean-burning aspects of natural gas and abundance of supply make it an economically competitive and environmentally advantaged alternative. We believe that ONEOK Partners’ pipelines and storage assets compete effectively due to their strategic locations connecting supply areas to market centers and other pipelines.
Customers - ONEOK Partners’ natural gas pipeline assets primarily serve local natural gas distribution companies, electric-generation facilities, large industrial companies, municipalities, irrigation customers and marketing companies. Utility customers generally require ONEOK Partners’ services regardless of commodity prices. See discussion regarding ONEOK Partners’ customer credit risk under “Counterparty Credit Risk” in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Government Regulation - Interstate - ONEOK Partners’ interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated under the Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act, which give the FERC jurisdiction to regulate virtually all aspects of this business, such as transportation of natural gas, rates and charges for services, construction of new facilities, depreciation and amortization policies, acquisition and disposition of facilities, and the initiation and discontinuation of services.
Intrastate - ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas are regulated by the OCC, KCC and RRC, respectively. While it has flexibility in establishing natural gas transportation rates with customers, there is a maximum rate that it can charge its customers in Oklahoma and Kansas. In Kansas and Texas, natural gas storage may be regulated by the state and by the FERC for certain types of services. In Oklahoma, natural gas storage is not subject to rate regulation by the state, and ONEOK Partners has market-based rate authority from the FERC for certain types of services.

Other
Through ONEOK Leasing Company, L.L.C. and ONEOK Parking Company, L.L.C., we own a 17-story office building (ONEOK Plaza) with approximately 505,000 square feet of net rentable space and a parking garage in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, where our headquarters are located. ONEOK Leasing Company, L.L.C. leases excess office space to others and operates our headquarters office building. ONEOK Parking Company, L.L.C. owns and operates a parking garage adjacent to our headquarters.
REGULATORY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS
Environmental Matters - ONEOK Partners is subject to multiple historical preservation and environmental laws and/or regulations that affect many aspects of its present and future operations. Regulated activities include, but are not limited to, those involving air emissions, storm water and wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, wetlands preservation, hazardous materials transportation, and pipeline and facility construction. These laws and regulations require ONEOK Partners to obtain and/or comply with a wide variety of environmental clearances, registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, licenses and permits may expose ONEOK Partners to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in its operations that could be material to our results of operations. For 
16

example, if a leak or spill of hazardous substances or petroleum products occurs from pipelines or facilities that ONEOK Partners owns, operates or otherwise uses, ONEOK Partners could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including response, investigation and cleanup costs, which could affect materially our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, emissions controls and/or other regulatory or permitting mandates under the Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at ONEOK Partners’ facilities. We cannot assure that existing environmental statutes and regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to ONEOK Partners.
Pipeline Safety - ONEOK Partners is subject to PHMSA regulations, including pipeline asset integrity-management regulations. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 requires pipeline companies operating high-pressure pipelines to perform integrity assessments on pipeline segments that pass through densely populated areas or near specifically designated high-consequence areas. In January 2012, The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act) was signed into law. The law increased maximum penalties for violating federal pipeline safety regulations and directs the DOT and Secretary of Transportation to conduct further review or studies on issues that may or may not be material to ONEOK Partners. These issues include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | an evaluation on whether hazardous natural gas liquids and natural gas pipeline integrity-management requirements should be expanded beyond current high-consequence areas;


• | a review of all natural gas and hazardous natural gas liquids gathering pipeline exemptions;


• | a verification of records for pipelines in Class 3 and 4 locations and high-consequence areas to confirm maximum allowable operating pressures (MAOP); and


• | a requirement to test previously untested pipelines operating above 30 percent yield strength in high-consequence areas.

In October 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rule-making to its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations. Among other things, the proposed regulations would expand the current leak-detection requirements, apply new, more conservative repair criteria and establish timelines for inspecting pipeline facilities potentially affected by an extreme weather event or natural disaster. The proposal would also increase the stringency of integrity management program requirements and set deadlines for the use of internal inspection tools on certain systems. Comments on the proposed rule-making were due by January 2016. PHMSA has issued a prepublication version of the final rule, but it will not be effective until after it is published in the Federal Register. However, in January 2017, prior to publication of the order, the current administration issued a memorandum asking all agencies to immediately withdraw any proposed or final regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register but not yet published. It is unclear how this will impact the hazardous liquids pipeline safety regulations.
In March 2016, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rule-making for gas transmission and gathering lines that would substantially revise that agency’s rules for construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline systems. PHMSA proposes to codify the “traceable, verifiable and complete” standard for records that it issued after a 2010 pipeline explosion in San Bruno, California. Other key changes would modify maximum allowable operating pressure requirements for all gas pipelines, revise several integrity management program requirements, expand the application of several integrity management programs to a newly defined class of “moderate consequence area,” increase corrosion control requirements and modify the regulation of gas gathering lines. Comments on the proposed rule-making were due in July 2016.
In December 2016, PHMSA issued an Interim Final Rule for underground natural gas storage facilities, subjecting these storage facilities to minimum federal safety standards for the first time. Under the Interim Final Rule, existing facilities must have appropriate operational, maintenance, integrity demonstration and verification, monitoring, threat and hazard identification, assessment, remediation, site security, emergency response and preparedness, and recordkeeping procedures in place, along with implementation plans and schedules, by January 2018. Comments are due in February 2017.
The potential capital and operating expenditures related to the referenced proposed regulations are unknown, but we do not anticipate a material impact to ONEOK Partners’ planned capital, operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the current or pending regulations.
Air and Water Emissions - The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, analogous state laws and/or regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into the air and water in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act, a federally enforceable operating permit is required for sources of significant air emissions. ONEOK Partners may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution-control equipment in connection with obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals for sources of air emissions. The Clean Water Act imposes substantial potential liability for the removal of pollutants discharged to waters of the United States and remediation of waters affected by such discharge.
17

International, federal, regional and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit GHG emissions. ONEOK Partners monitors all relevant legislation and regulatory initiatives to assess the potential impact on its operations. The EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires annual GHG emissions reporting from affected facilities and the carbon dioxide emission equivalents for the natural gas delivered by ONEOK Partners and the emission equivalents for all NGLs produced by ONEOK Partners as if all of these products were combusted, even if they are used otherwise.
ONEOK Partners’ 2015 total reported emissions were approximately 47.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. This total includes direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in ONEOK Partners’ equipment, such as compressor engines and heaters, as well as carbon dioxide equivalents from natural gas and NGL products delivered to customers and produced as if all such fuel and NGL products were combusted. The additional cost to gather and report this emission data did not have, and we do not expect it to have, a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, Congress has considered, and may consider in the future, legislation to reduce GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. Likewise, the EPA may institute additional regulatory rule-making associated with GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. At this time, no rule or legislation has been enacted that assesses any costs, fees or expenses on any of these emissions.
In June 2013, the Executive Office of the President of the United States (the President) issued the President’s Climate Action Plan, which includes, among other things, plans for further regulatory actions to reduce carbon emissions from various sources. In March 2014, the President released the Climate Action Plan - Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions (Methane Strategy) that lists a number of actions the federal agencies will undertake to continue to reduce above-ground methane emissions from several industries, including the oil and natural gas sectors. The impact of any such regulatory actions on ONEOK Partners’ facilities and operations is unknown. ONEOK Partners continues to monitor these developments and the impact they may have on its businesses.
In September 2015, the EPA published several proposed rule-makings that affect the oil and gas industry. The rule-makings included, but were not limited to, proposed amendments to its existing New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the oil and gas industry. The proposed amendments to the NSPS rules included, in part, the proposed direct regulation of methane emissions for the first time as an individual air pollutant from new, modified or reconstructed oil and gas sources, as part of the President’s Methane Strategy. In June 2016, the final NSPS rule was published and became effective in August 2016. The final provisions of the NSPS rule include varied timelines for initial compliance, which run from the effective date. These compliance measures generally include additional capital and operating expenditures. We do not anticipate a material impact to ONEOK Partners’ planned capital, operations or maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the final rule.
In March 2016, the EPA announced a formal information collection request (ICR) process to require companies to provide information to assist in the development of comprehensive regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. The EPA published drafts of the ICR on June 3 and September 29 and issued the final ICR on November 10, 2016. The ICR consists of two parts. Part I is designed to obtain information from onshore oil and gas production facilities regarding the number and types of equipment at production facilities. Part 2 will collect detailed information on emissions sources and emissions control devices or practices in use at onshore production, gathering and boosting, processing, compression/transmission, pipeline, natural gas storage, and NGL storage and import/export facilities. ONEOK Partners is in the process of responding to the Part 2 ICR notices it received.
In April 2014, the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers proposed a joint rule-making to redefine the definition of “Waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act. The final rule was published in June 2015 and became effective on August 28, 2015. Multiple legal actions on the final rule were filed. In October 2015, the Unites States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit entered an order of stay, which is still in effect, and postponed the effect of the final rule nationwide until it decided further proceedings in the case. The final rule is not expected to result in material impacts on ONEOK Partners’ projects, facilities and operations.
In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule-making to amend downward the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground level ozone. The final rule requires revised designations of the areas in the various states for classification as in attainment or nonattainment for the new ozone NAAQS. Any areas determined to not attain the ozone NAAQS will implicate more strict air permitting requirements for new or modified sources that emit pollutants that contribute to ground level ozone.
At this time we do not anticipate a material impact to ONEOK Partners’ planned capital, operations and maintenance costs resulting from compliance with the current or pending regulations and EPA actions outlined above. However, the EPA may issue additional regulations, responses, amendments and/or policy guidance, which could alter our present expectations. 
18

Generally, the EPA rule-makings will require expenditures for updated emissions controls, monitoring and recordkeeping requirements at affected facilities.
CERCLA - The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also commonly known as Superfund, imposes strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of “persons” (defined under CERCLA) who caused and/or contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include, but are not limited to, the owner or operator of a facility where the release occurred and/or companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the facility. Under CERCLA, these persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances released into the environment, damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies. We do not expect ONEOK Partners’ responsibilities under CERCLA will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Chemical Site Security - The United States Department of Homeland Security (Homeland Security) released the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards in 2007, and the new final rule associated with these regulations was issued in December 2014. ONEOK Partners provided information regarding its chemicals via Top-Screens submitted to Homeland Security, and its facilities subsequently were assigned one of four risk-based tiers ranging from high (Tier 1) to low (Tier 4) risk, or not tiered at all due to low risk. To date, four of its facilities have been given a Tier 4 rating. Facilities receiving a Tier 4 rating are required to complete Site Security Plans and possible physical security enhancements. We do not expect the Site Security Plans and possible security enhancement costs to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Pipeline Security - The United States Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration and the DOT have completed a review and inspection of ONEOK Partners’ “critical facilities” and identified no material security issues. Also, the Transportation Security Administration has released new pipeline security guidelines that include broader definitions for the determination of pipeline “critical facilities.” ONEOK Partners has reviewed its pipeline facilities according to the new guideline requirements, and there have been no material changes required to date.
Environmental Footprint - ONEOK Partners’ environmental and climate change actions focus on minimizing the impact of its operations on the environment. These actions include: (i) developing and maintaining an accurate GHG emissions inventory according to current rules issued by the EPA; (ii) improving the efficiency of its various pipelines, natural gas processing facilities and natural gas liquids fractionation facilities; (iii) following developing technologies for emissions control and the capture of carbon dioxide to keep it from reaching the atmosphere; and (iv) utilizing practices to reduce the loss of methane from its facilities.
ONEOK Partners participates in the EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Program to reduce voluntarily methane emissions. ONEOK Partners continues to focus on maintaining low rates of lost-and-unaccounted-for methane gas through expanded implementation of best practices to limit the release of natural gas during pipeline and facility maintenance and operations.
