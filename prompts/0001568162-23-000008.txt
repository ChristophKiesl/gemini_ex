Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are an externally managed real estate investment trust for United States (“U.S.”) federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) focusing on acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of primarily service-oriented and traditional retail and distribution-related commercial real estate properties located primarily in the U.S. Our assets consist primarily of freestanding single-tenant properties that are net leased to “investment grade” and other creditworthy tenants and a portfolio of multi-tenant retail properties consisting primarily of power centers and lifestyle centers. We historically focused our acquisitions primarily on net leased, single-tenant service retail properties, defined as properties leased to tenants in the retail banking, restaurant, grocery, pharmacy, gas, convenience, fitness, and auto services sectors. 
On December 17, 2021, we signed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire 79 multi-tenant retail centers and two single-tenant properties (the “CIM Portfolio Acquisition”) for $1.3 billion, representing a strategic shift away from a primary focus on single-tenant retail properties. The CIM Portfolio Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The acquisition closed in multiple transactions from February 2022 through July 2022, and the consideration included cash (including cash sourced from borrowings under the Credit Facility, as defined below), assumption of existing mortgage debt securing certain of the properties and the issuance of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Class A common stock”).
Our Class A common stock, our 7.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock $0.01 par value per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”) and our 7.375% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock $0.01 par value per share (“Series C Preferred Stock”) trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbols “RTL,” “RTLPP” and “RTLPO,” respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 1,044 properties, comprised of 27.9 million rentable square feet, which were 93.7% leased, including 935 single-tenant net leased commercial properties (897 of which are leased to retail tenants) and 109 multi-tenant retail properties. Based on annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2022, the total single-tenant properties comprised 48% of our total portfolio and were 67% leased to service retail tenants, and the total multi-tenant properties comprised 52% of our total portfolio and were 42% leased to experiential retail tenants, defined as tenants in the restaurant, discount retail, entertainment, salon/beauty and grocery sectors, among others.
We operate in two reportable segments: single-tenant properties and multi-tenant properties.
Investment Strategy
In addition to focusing on acquiring a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate properties with the tenants and other attributes noted above we also focus on:
•acquiring and owning service-oriented retail properties or experiential retail tenants that we believe are more resistant to e-commerce and the factors impacting traditional retail;
•maintaining high portfolio occupancy with a focus on service retail single-tenant and multi-tenant assets featuring long-term leases;
•targeting a leverage level of not more than 45% loan-to-value at the time of acquisition; and
•maintaining diversity by tenant as well as a geographic location and lease term.
There is no limit on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire. The number and mix of properties depends upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition of properties. 
We may acquire or own properties through joint ventures with third parties although we do not presently have any of these arrangements. We do not intend to develop or redevelop properties. In evaluating prospective investments, our Advisor considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting it, the creditworthiness of its major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans (secured by real estate) but do not currently own any of these asset types. Our Advisor has substantial discretion to select specific investments, subject to approval by our board of directors, including any related guidelines. 
Tenants and Leasing
We seek to lease space at our single-tenant properties and our multi-tenant anchor spaces to “investment grade” rated tenants. For our purposes, “investment grade” includes both tenants (or lease guarantors) with actual investment grade ratings or tenants with “implied” investment grade ratings. Implied investment grade may include the actual rating of a tenant’s parent or the guarantor of the parent (regardless of whether the parent has guaranteed the tenant’s obligation under 
the lease) or tenants that are identified as investment grade by using a proprietary Moody’s analytical tool which generates an implied rating by measuring an entity’s probability of default. Based on annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2022, approximately 53.8% of the tenants in our single-tenant portfolio were considered “investment grade” consisting of 41.1% with actual investment grade ratings and 12.7% with implied investment grade ratings, and approximately 37.2% of the anchor tenants in our multi-tenant portfolio were considered “investment grade” consisting of 30.5% with actual investment grade ratings and 6.7% with implied investment grade ratings. 
We do not have any leases or contracts with governmental entities. We also seek to maintain high occupancy rates through long-term leases. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio was 93.7% occupied.
Our business is generally not seasonal.
Financing Strategies and Policies 
We use various sources to fund our business, including acquisitions and other investments as well as property and tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. These sources have recently consisted of: (1) equity offerings of common and preferred stock; (2) property-level financing secured by the underlying property or properties; (3) draws on our revolving unsecured corporate credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with BMO Harris Bank N.A.; and (4) the issuance, in the fourth quarter of 2021, of our 4.500% Senior Notes due 2028 (“Senior Notes”).
In May, 2021, we began a deleveraging initiative. We hope to achieve this initiative by reducing outstanding debt, funding acquisitions through cash on hand rather than proceeds from debt, or at lower debt-to-equity ratios, raising equity to fund acquisitions and paying down debt; and increasing revenues through external and internal growth strategies such as property acquisitions and multi-tenant leasing activity. We paused this strategy when we acquired the CIM Portfolio Acquisition which we viewed as being transformative to our asset base. As a result, our leverage increased in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to prior periods. We plan to opportunistically continue with our deleveraging strategy now that the CIM Portfolio Acquisition is complete. We may, however, issue additional Senior Notes or similar securities in the future particularly as we revise our capital structure following the CIM Portfolio Acquisition in a similar fashion as we may add or refinance existing mortgage debt or indebtedness under our Credit Facility. Throughout 2022, we strategically disposed of several assets, including certain assets acquired in the CIM Portfolio Acquisition, and the net proceeds of which were primarily used to repay indebtedness. We are evaluating other assets in our portfolio for potential sale, including assets recently acquired in the CIM Portfolio Acquisition, and if we are able to sell these assets, we intend to use the net proceeds primarily to repay indebtedness. See Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources herein for a discussion of how we have funded our capital needs during 2022 and expect to fund our capital needs during 2023. 
We also expect to raise additional equity capital and borrow additional monies in the future to fund our capital needs, including future acquisitions. The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, these types of transactions in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. See Note 8 — Derivatives and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. We may reevaluate and change our investing or financing policies in our board’s sole discretion.
COVID-19 Update
As discussed, in more detail in other sections of this Annual Report, the COVID-19 pandemic created several risks and uncertainties that impacted our business and may further impact our business, including our future results of operations and our liquidity. Because of the rigorous underwriting standards used by our Advisor and our focus on credit worthy tenants, we collected 98% of the original cash rent due for the fourth quarter of 2022 across our entire portfolio. This was consistent with the quarterly collections during the other three quarters of 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021 and reflects the expiration of rent deferral agreements where tenants have resumed paying full rent as well as collections of deferred rent paid during the period. For additional information on our rent collection efforts, including deferral or abatement agreements, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis -Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
Organizational Structure
Substantially all of our business is conducted through The Necessity Retail REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (the “OP”), a Delaware limited partnership, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our Advisor manages our day-to-day business with the assistance of our property manager, Necessity Retail Properties, LLC (the “Property Manager”). Our Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments LLC (“AR Global”) and these related parties receive compensation and fees for providing services to us. We also reimburse these entities for certain expenses they incur in providing these services to us.
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and have operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but can provide no assurance that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. To continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)), determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
Competition
The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We compete for tenants in all of our markets based on various factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to a tenant’s needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
In addition, we compete for acquisitions with other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, mutual funds, and other entities. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater financial resources than we have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants.
Competition from these and other third-party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase prices, which will lower yields, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.
Regulations - General
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. These regulations have not had a material effect on our business and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the current fiscal year.
Regulations - Environmental
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2022, and we do not expect any such material capital expenditures during 2023. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future. We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase. 
Human Capital Resources
We are an externally managed company and thus have no employees. We have retained the Advisor pursuant to a long-term advisory contract to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. We have also entered into agreements with our Property Manager to manage and lease our properties. The employees of the Advisor, Property Manager, and their respective affiliates perform a full range of services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management, investor relations and all general administrative services. The employees of the Advisor, Property Manager and their respective affiliates are also eligible to participate in our stock option plan and our employee and director incentive restricted share plan. We depend on the Advisor and the Property Manager for services that are essential to us. If the Advisor and the Property Manager were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide these services ourselves or obtain them from other sources.
