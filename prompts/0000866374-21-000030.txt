ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Flex is the manufacturing partner of choice that helps a diverse customer base design and build products that improve the world. Through the collective strength of a global workforce across approximately 30 countries and responsible, sustainable operations, Flex delivers technology innovation, supply chain, and manufacturing solutions to diverse industries and end markets. 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, Flex made certain changes in its organization structure as part of its strategy to further drive growth, efficiency and productivity with two focused and complementary delivery models, Flex Agility Solutions and Flex Reliability Solutions, Flex now reports its financial performance based on these two reportable segments: 
•Flex Agility Solutions ("FAS"), which is comprised of the following end markets:
◦Communications, Enterprise and Cloud ("CEC"), including data infrastructure, edge infrastructure and communications infrastructure;
◦Lifestyle, including appliances, consumer packaging, floorcare, micro mobility and audio; and
◦Consumer Devices, including mobile and high velocity consumer devices.
•Flex Reliability Solutions ("FRS"), which is comprised of the following end markets:
◦Automotive, including autonomous, connectivity, electrification, and smart technologies;
◦Health Solutions, including medical devices, medical equipment and drug delivery; and
◦Industrial, including capital equipment, industrial devices, renewable including our Nextracker business, grid edge, and power systems.
The FAS segment is optimized for speed to market based on a highly flexible supply and manufacturing system. The FRS segment is optimized for longer product lifecycles requiring complex ramps with specialized production models and critical environments.
Our customers include many of the world's leading technology, healthcare, automotive, and industrial companies. We are focused on establishing long-term relationships with our customers and have been successful in expanding relationships to incorporate additional product lines and services. 
In fiscal year 2021, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of net sales. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's net sales in fiscal year 2021.
Flex believes that growth in the contract manufacturing services industry will be largely driven by the need for OEMs to respond to rapidly changing industries, markets and technologies, as well as the increasing complexity of supply chains and the continued pressure to be innovative and cost competitive. Additionally, we believe there are significant opportunities for global 
manufacturing services providers to win additional business from OEMs in markets or industry segments that have yet to substantially outsource manufacturing. Finally, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic may drive further growth opportunities as it highlights numerous new vulnerabilities and challenges for OEMs, which will require OEMs from all markets and industries to evaluate their supply chain resiliency.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
We believe that the performance of our Company is impacted by our human capital management, and as a result we consistently work to attract, select, develop, engage and retain strong, diverse talent. Our policies, philosophy and strategies support the inclusion of all people in our working environment. Further, we’re committed to respecting the human rights of our employees and improving their quality of life. 
In 2020, the Company introduced new vision, mission, purpose, and value statements in support of cultivating an inclusive, high-performing culture where employees are empowered and given opportunities to reach their full potential. We are committed to providing a positive and safe workplace for Flex employees, respecting their dignity, creating an inclusive environment, and ensuring access to opportunity. We recognize that we have an opportunity to promote and support a culture of inclusion and diversity, wellness, and health and safety among our employees.
Employees. As of March 31, 2021, our global workforce totaled approximately 167,201 employees including our contractor workforce. In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils.

Region: | Number of Employees
Asia | 59,252 
Americas | 76,503 
Europe | 31,446 
Total | 167,201 

Well-being, Health, and Safety. Flex is committed to providing a safe and injury-free workplace. We provide programs and tools to improve physical, mental, financial, and social well-being, with increased focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our programs give access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs for our global employees, including on-site health centers in some of our major factories, which were increasingly critical this year for our essential workers who have worked on site since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We promote a “zero-injury” culture through health and safety management systems, some of which are certified ISO 45001:2018, that implement a data-driven and risk-based approach in monitoring and reporting performance regularly. Some of the specific goals for which we measure our performance include increasing employee development, social and environmental management system audits, human rights policy training completion, Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA") compliance for rest day requirements, and decreasing safety incident rates.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we deployed our contingency and resiliency plans that are encompassed in our business continuity programs. Our resiliency advisory and crisis management teams defined work streams and activated site teams with hundreds of employees, organizing across our global footprint, and coordinating and communicating with our suppliers and customers. Our leadership teams initiated enhanced health and safety measures across all facilities, as our foremost focus has been the health and safety of our employees. For those employees who could work from home, we provided them with the tools and support to do so. This allowed us to focus resources and additional investment on our manufacturing facilities. We modified practices at our manufacturing locations and offices to require personal protective equipment, sanitization measures, temperature checks, and social distancing. Our protocols to protect employees and safely operate our facilities have been in partnership with several governments, including those in China, Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil, and Europe. These measures enabled us to continue to conduct operations throughout the pandemic and have been recognized by several governments as a role model for employee safety. 
Inclusion and Diversity. Inclusion and diversity are key priorities and strengths at Flex and are embedded in the fabric of our culture. Our commitment to diversity is exemplified by the composition of our Board of which three of eleven directors are female and six of eleven directors are ethnically diverse.
In 2020, we continued our progress on improving inclusion and diversity through employee programs. We launched or re-launched our employee resources groups (ERGs) which work to create a community that fosters freedom of self, build cultural awareness and develop a new generation of diverse leaders at Flex by establishing a sustainable structure with executive support that challenges bias and promotes unity. The Company maintains ERG chapters worldwide across five categories: Black, LatinX, Disabilities, Women and Veterans. These groups help to create a sense of belonging and support retention and attraction. Each ERG has an executive sponsor and is supported by senior leaders across the Company. The Company also held cultural awareness activities throughout the year to highlight specific groups including People with disabilities, Black History Month, LatinX Heritage Month, and Women’s History Month. 
Additionally, we launched our cross-functional Global Inclusion Counsel, led by our CEO, of 12 members that represent diverse viewpoints. In partnership with McKinsey, we offered leadership development opportunities through their Management Accelerator and Executive Leadership Program to 56 Black employees. We also enhanced SheLeads, our leadership development program for women employees, and implemented a new unconscious bias training for all people managers to, among other things, provide tools to help managers lead more inclusively and improve diversity in recruiting. Furthermore, we leveraged external community partnerships with organizations such as the Business Roundtable, The Valuable 500, and INROADS to amplify our impact in recruiting and retaining diverse talent.
Our commitment to diversity starts at the top with our highly skilled and diverse Board of Directors and female CEO. Our board of directors includes three female directors (representing approximately 27% of directors) and six underrepresented minority directors (representing approximately 54% of directors).
As of March 31, 2021, women represent 44% of our global employees, and underrepresented minorities (those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) represent 59% of our U.S. employees. Approximately 17% of our executive team and approximately 21% percent of our leadership team (director level and above) are female. Approximately 11% of our executive team and approximately 33% percent of our U.S. leadership team (director level and above) are comprised of underrepresented minorities.
We established corporate goals to increase the number of employees and leaders from underrepresented groups and will continue to evolve these over time to improve representation. In developing these goals, we focused on hiring, retaining and promoting diversity across the organization. Additionally, we remain committed to parity in pay and opportunity in the U.S. by 2022. 
Talent Attraction, Development, and Retention. Talent attraction, development, and retention are critical to our success and core to our mission as a company. To support the advancement of our employees, we provide training and development programs and opportunities encouraging advancement from within as well as continue to fill our team with strong and experienced external talent. We leverage both formal and informal programs, including in-person (as health and safety allows), virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development to identify, foster, and retain top talent. Employees have access to courses through our learning and development platform, Flex Learn. In 2020, 31,996 of our employees completed 397,408 hours of training programs. Flex has undertaken initiatives to keep employees who are working from home engaged during COVID-19, including virtual learning programs and check-in sessions.
We are also focused on completing talent and performance reviews. Our in-depth talent reviews serve to identify high potential talent to advance in roles with greater responsibility, assess learning and development needs, and establish and refresh succession plans for critical leadership roles across the enterprise. Our performance review process promotes transparent communication of team member performance, which we believe is a key factor in our success. The performance and the talent reviews enable ongoing assessments, reviews, and mentoring to identify career development and learning opportunities for our employees.
As a part of our efforts to improve employee experiences at Flex, we conduct the annual enterprise-wide employee engagement Flex Voice survey. Our leadership uses the results of the survey to continue developing our strengths and measure opportunities for improvement. This year 94% of employees completed the Flex Voice survey and the results reflected increased enthusiasm and engagement. 
Compensation and Benefits. Our total rewards are designed to attract, motivate and retain employees. Our compensation philosophy is driven by the desire to attract and retain top talent, while ensuring that compensation aligns with our corporate financial objectives and the long-term interests of our shareholders. Our pay structures offer competitive salaries, bonuses and equity awards in the countries where we operate. 
In each of the countries where we have operations, our comprehensive benefit plans offer a locally competitive mix of some or all of the following: medical, dental and vision insurance, short and long-term disability, flexible spending accounts, various types of voluntary coverage, and other benefit programs. We routinely benchmark our salaries and benefits against market peers to ensure our total rewards package remains competitive. 
Board Oversight of Human Capital Management. The Compensation and People Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for assisting the Board in oversight of our human capital management, including among other aspects, receiving periodic updates (not less than twice annually) regarding, and overseeing any significant change to, our human capital management strategy including corporate culture, inclusion, pay and opportunity equity, diversity, social initiatives and results, and talent, training, development, and retention programs.
Additional Human Capital Management Information. Additional information regarding human capital management will be included in our proxy statement filed in connection with our 2021 Annual General Meeting and our upcoming sustainability report. The information in the proxy statement and the sustainability report is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference.
SUSTAINABILITY
At Flex, our sustainability journey began in 2002 with the creation of the Flex Foundation. For nearly 20 years, sustainability has been integrated into the fabric of our company, a key area of differentiation for Flex. Our focus has been to 
reduce our environmental impact, ensure the safety and well-being of our workforce, and commit to external reporting transparency on our progress. 
Our strategy and global efforts, through our sustainability programs and multi-year objectives, are aligned with the principles set forth in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals ("SDGs"). For the last two years, we were named an Advanced member of the United Nations Global Compact ("UNGC"), the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative, showcasing our commitment to integrate sustainability throughout our company and across our entire supply chain. We recently updated our sustainability strategy for 2030, including goals across the environmental, social, and governance pillars. Several goals of note include cutting operational emissions in half, providing access to mental health and well-being services to all employees, and maintaining top quartile performance for governance and transparency. The Flex Social and Environmental framework is based upon the principles, policies, and standards prescribed by the RBA, a worldwide association of electronics companies committed to promoting an industry code of conduct to improve working and environmental, health and safety conditions, as well as other relevant international standards (e.g., ISO 14001, United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights). 
During our calendar year 2020, we received several awards and accolades for our sustainability programs including the Manufacturing Leadership award for our sustainability efforts from the National Association of Manufacturers. In addition, we received Cisco’s annual supplier award for our sustainability performance for 2020. Sustainalytics named us #1 in the contract manufacturing sub-industry category and we were ranked in the top 50 out of approximately 13,000 companies overall.
Through the Flex Foundation, we work with nonprofits, community leaders and governments to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all. We help protect the environment, support resource conservation and provide disaster relief. We accomplish this through grants, corporate and employee donations, and volunteerism. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Flex Foundation made financial contributions to leading organizations, like the World Health Organization and Red Cross to help support efforts in combating COVID-19 in the countries in which we operate. The company also donated masks to local communities, front-line workers, as well as to Flex employees and their families.
Flex is committed to transparency in sustainability reporting. The company has adhered to the Global Reporting Initiative since 2013 and has published an annual sustainability report each year since 2016. In 2020, we improved our ratings receiving an A for water from CDP and an A- for climate change. The company also aligned its last sustainability report to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework.
More detailed information can be found in the Flex annual sustainability report located at https://flex.com/company/our-sustainability. The information in the sustainability report and on our sustainability webpage is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference. 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental regulations, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that our operations comply with all applicable environmental regulations.
We also comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused upon the restriction of certain hazardous substances, including: 
•Restrictions on Hazardous Substances ("RoHS") 2011/65/EU
•Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("WEEE") 2012/19/EU directives
•The regulation EC 1907/2006 EU Directive REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals")
•China RoHS entitled, Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for Electronic Information Products ("EIPs") 
We do not believe that costs of compliance with these environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results, or competitive position. In addition, we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third-party sites. We engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities associated with our ongoing operations, historical disposal activities, and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements. We determine the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the probability of occurrence and the reasonable possibility of incurring costs in light of information currently available. 
The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations, the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters. Additionally, we could be required to alter our operations in order to comply with any new standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations. There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no issue is currently known. 
Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including the United States. Our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risks of non-compliance. We have developed rigorous compliance programs designed to meet the needs and specifications of our customers as well as the regulations. These programs vary from collecting compliance or material data from our Flex controlled or managed suppliers to full laboratory testing. We include compliance requirements in our standard supplier contracts. Non-compliance could result in significant costs and/or penalties. 
RoHS and other similar legislation ban or restrict the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products and WEEE requires EU importers and/or producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. In the case of WEEE, although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with the EU importers and/or producers rather than with EMS companies, OEMs may turn to EMS companies for assistance in meeting their WEEE obligations. Flex continues to monitor developments related to product environmental compliance and is working with our customers and other technical organizations to anticipate and minimize any impacts to our operations.
Refer to the discussion in "Risk Factors" for further details of the legal and regulatory initiatives related to climate change that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We own or license various United States and foreign patents relating to a variety of technologies. For certain of our proprietary processes, inventions, and works of authorship, we rely on trade secret or copyright protection. We also maintain trademark rights (including registrations) for our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the United States and other countries throughout the world. We have implemented appropriate policies and procedures (including both technological means and training programs for our employees) to identify and protect our intellectual property, as well as that of our customers and suppliers. As of March 31, 2021, and 2020, the carrying value of our intellectual property was not material.
Although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it, from time to time third parties assert patent infringement claims against us or our customers. In addition, we provide design and engineering services to our customers and also design and make our own products. As a consequence of these activities, our customers are sometimes requiring us to take responsibility for intellectual property to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses. If and when third parties make assertions regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property, we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation. Such license rights might not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and any such litigation might not be resolved in our favor. Additionally, litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome. We also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re-perform design services. See "Risk Factors - The success of certain of our activities depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; claims of infringement or misuse of intellectual property and/or breach of license agreement provisions against our customers or us could harm our business."
