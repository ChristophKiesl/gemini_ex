General 
 The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (Boston Beer or the Company) is one of the largest craft brewers in the United States. In fiscal 2016, Boston Beer sold approximately 4.0 million barrels of its proprietary products.
During 2016, the Company sold over sixty beers under the Samuel Adams® and the Sam Adams® brand names, over twenty hard cider beverages under the Angry Orchard® brand name, thirteen flavored malt beverages under the Twisted Tea® brand name, four hard seltzer beverages under the Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand name, and over forty beers under four of the brand names of its subsidiary, A&S Brewing Collaborative LLC, under the tradename A&S Brewing. 
 Boston Beer produces alcohol beverages including malt beverages (beers), hard cider and hard seltzer at Company-owned breweries and under contract arrangements at other brewery locations. The Samuel Adams Company-owned breweries are located in Boston, Massachusetts (the Boston Brewery), Cincinnati, Ohio (the Cincinnati Brewery) and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania (the Pennsylvania Brewery). The A&S Brewing Company-owned small breweries are located in Los Angeles, California (the Angel City Brewery), Miami, Florida (the Concrete Beach Brewery) and Brooklyn, New York (the Coney Island Brewery). The Company owns an apple orchard and cidery located in Walden, New York (the Orchard). 
 The Companys principal executive offices are located at One Design Center Place, Suite 850, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, and its telephone number is (617) 368-5000.
Industry Background 
 Before Prohibition, the United States beer industry consisted of hundreds of small breweries that brewed full-flavored beers. After the end of Prohibition, most domestic brewers shifted production to less flavorful, lighter beers, which use lower-cost ingredients, and can be mass-produced to take advantage of economies of scale in production. This shift towards mass-produced beers coincided with consolidation in the beer industry. Today, two major brewers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) and MillerCoors LLC (MillerCoors), comprise over 80% of all United States domestic beer production, excluding imports. 
 The Companys beers are primarily positioned in the Better Beer category of the beer industry, which includes craft (small, independent and traditional) brewers, domestic specialty beers and most imports. Better Beers are determined by higher price, quality, image and taste, as compared with regular domestic beers. Samuel Adams is one of the largest brands in the Better Beer category of the United States brewing industry. The Companys A&S Brewing brands, which include the Traveler Beer Co.®, the Angel City Brewing Company®, the Concrete Beach Brewery® and the Coney Island® Brewing Company also compete in the Better Beer category. The Company estimates that in 2016 the Better Beer category percentage volume growth was approximately 6% with the craft beer category volume growth approximately 7% and total beer category volume essentially flat. The Company believes that the Better Beer category is approximately 29% of United States beer consumption by volume. 
 The domestic beer industry, excluding Better Beers, has experienced a decline in shipment volume over the last ten years. The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high quality, more flavorful beers and increased competition from wine and spirits companies. 
 The Companys Twisted Tea products compete within the flavored malt beverage (FMB) category of the beer industry (and the Companys Twisted Tea products are included in generic references to the Companys beers in this report). The Company believes that the FMB category comprises approximately 4% of United States beer 
 
1 
 
 consumption and that the volume comprising the FMB category grew approximately 5% in 2016. This category is highly competitive due to, among other factors, the presence of large brewers and spirits companies in the category, the advertising of malt-based spirits brands in channels not available to the parent brands and a fast pace of product innovation. 
 The Companys Angry Orchard ciders compete within the hard cider category that has similar characteristics to the beer industry for reporting and regulatory purposes. The Company believes that the hard cider category comprises less than 1% of United States beer consumption. This category is small and highly competitive and includes large international and domestic competitors, as well as many small regional and local hard cider companies. The hard cider category experienced very fast growth until a slowing in 2015 and category volume decreased approximately 12% in 2016. 
 The Companys Coney Island Hard Sodas and Truly Spiked & Sparkling beverages compete within the hard soda and hard seltzer categories, respectively, and these categories have similar characteristics to the beer industry for reporting and regulatory purposes. These categories are small, in their early stages of development, highly competitive and include large international and domestic competitors. The Companys Coney Island Hard Sodas and Truly Spiked & Sparkling beverages are included in generic references to the Companys beers in this report. The Company launched Coney Island Hard Root Beer nationally during the second half of 2015 and Truly Spiked & Sparkling in the second half of 2016. The Company believes the hard soda category comprises less than 0.5% of United States beer consumption and that the volume comprising this category increased in 2016 because of full year availability, but, as best as can be determined, declined in the fourth quarter. The Company believes the hard seltzer category grew in 2016 due to new entrants and expanded distribution, but still comprises less than 0.1% of United States beer consumption and may have significant seasonality. 
 Description of Business 
 The Companys business goal is to become the leading supplier in the Better Beer category and the other categories where it competes by creating and offering high quality full-flavored alcohol beverages. With the support of a large, well-trained sales organization and world-class brewers, the Company strives to achieve this goal by offering great beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers, and increasing brand availability and awareness through advertising, point-of-sale, promotional programs and drinker education. 
 Beers, Hard Ciders and Hard Seltzers Marketed 
 The Companys strategy is to create and offer a world-class variety of traditional and innovative alcohol beverages, with a focus on promoting the Samuel Adams brand, but supported by a portfolio of complementary brands. The Angry Orchard brand family was launched in the second half of 2011 in several markets and achieved national distribution in 2012. Since 2013, Angry Orchard has been the largest selling hard cider in the United States. The Twisted Tea brand family has grown each year since the product was first introduced in 2001 and has established a loyal drinker following. In 2016, the Company began national distribution of the Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand and it secured a leading position in the category during 2016. The Companys A&S Brewing subsidiary currently has four brands, including Angel City, The Traveler Beer Co., Coney Island and Concrete Beach. 
 The Company sells its beverages in various packages. Kegs are sold primarily for on-premise retailers, which include bars, restaurants and other venues, and bottles and cans are sold primarily for off-premise retailers, which include grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores and liquor stores. 
 Samuel Adams Boston Lager® is the Companys flagship beer that was first introduced in 1984. The Samuel Adams Seasonal beers are brewed specifically for limited periods of time and in 2016 included Samuel Adams Cold Snap, Samuel Adams Summer Ale, Samuel Adams OctoberFest, and Samuel Adams Winter Lager. In the early part of 2017, the Company added two new seasonals to the seasonal program to replace Samuel Adams 
 
2 
 
 Cold Snap. These two new beers include: Samuel Adams Hopscape, for January and February 2017, and Samuel Adams Fresh as Helles, for February, March and April 2017. 
 Certain Samuel Adams beers may be produced at select times during the year solely for inclusion in the Companys seasonal variety packs. During 2016, Samuel Adams Escape Route®, Samuel Adams Noble Pils, Samuel Adams Scotch Ale and Samuel Adams Session Ale were brewed and included in the Spring variety pack, Samuel Adams Belgian Session, Samuel Adams Got to Gose, Samuel Adams Heaven or Helles and Samuel Adams Whitewater IPA were brewed and included in the Summer variety pack, Samuel Adams Bonfire Blonde, Samuel Adams Hoppy Red, Samuel Adams Maple Ale and Samuel Adams Toasted Caramel Bock were brewed and included in the Fall variety pack, Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock, Samuel Adams Ginger Beer, Samuel Adams Hopflake White IPA and Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig® Ale were brewed and included in the Winter Classics variety pack. Additionally, beginning in 2011 the Company began limited releases of seasonal beers in various packages. In 2016, these limited seasonal release beers included Samuel Adams Crystal Pale Ale, Samuel Adams Porch Rocker®, Samuel Adams Twenty Pounds of Pumpkin and Samuel Adams White Christmas. 
 After being in test markets during 2013, the Company began a national rollout of Samuel Adams Rebel® IPA, a West Coast style IPA brewed with hops from the Pacific Northwest, in early 2014. Since the national rollout, the Company has added additional styles to support Samuel Adams Rebel IPA, including Samuel Adams Rebel Grapefruit IPA, Samuel Adams Rebel Juiced IPA, Sam Adams Rebel Rouser® IPA and Samuel Adams Rebel Raw® IPA. In early 2016, the Company introduced Samuel Adams Rebel IPA Pack of Rebels which includes Samuel Adams Rebel Cascade IPA which is exclusive to this variety pack. In early 2017, the Company introduced a reformulation and new packaging of its original Samuel Adams Rebel IPA. The Rebel Reborn reformulation includes experimental hops that create a more tropical and piney IPA and is being launched nationally during the first quarter of 2017. 
 The Samuel Adams Brewmasters Collection is an important part of the Companys portfolio and heritage, but receives limited promotional support. The Samuel Adams Nitro Project was launched in 2016 and included three styles for most of 2016 that were available nationally. The Barrel Room Collection and Limited Edition Beers and certain specialty variety packs are produced in limited quantities and are sold at higher prices than the Companys other products. The Company also releases a variety of specialty draft beers brewed in limited quantities for festivals and Beer Week celebrations. 
 Since 2012, the Twisted Tea and Angry Orchard brand families have been available nationally. In 2015, the Company began national distribution of certain styles of The Traveler Beer Co. brand and the Coney Island brand, including Coney Island Hard Root Beer. In 2016, the Company began national distribution of certain styles of the Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand. All of these nationally available brands are available in various packages, including cans. The Company will continue to look for complementary opportunities to leverage its capabilities, provided that they do not distract from its primary focus on its Samuel Adams brand. 
 The Company continually evaluates the performance of its various beers and hard cider styles and the rationalization of its product line as a whole. Periodically, the Company discontinues certain styles and packages. Certain styles or brands discontinued in previous years may be produced for the Companys variety packs or reintroduced. 
 The Companys beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers are sold by the Companys sales force to the same types of customers in similar size quantities, at similar price points and through substantially the same channels of distribution. These beverages are manufactured using similar production processes, have comparable alcohol content and generally fall within the same regulatory environment. 
 Product and Packaging Innovations 
 The Company is committed to maintaining its position as a leading innovator. To that end, the Company continually test brews different beers, hard ciders and other alcohol beverages and occasionally sells them under 
 
3 
 
 various brand labels for evaluation of drinker interest. The Company also promotes the annual LongShot® American Homebrew Contest® in which homebrewers and employees of the Company submit their homebrews for inclusion in the LongShot® six-pack in the following year. In 2016, the Company sold over sixty Samuel Adams beers commercially and brewed many more test brews. The Companys Boston Brewery spends most of its time ideating, testing and developing alcohol beverages for the Companys potential future commercial development and evaluating ingredients and process improvements for existing beverages. 
 In 2013, the Company completed a two-year research effort to develop a can to improve the beer drinkers experience compared to the traditional can. The features of this can were designed to enhance the drinking experience and include a wider lid with an opening slightly further from the edge of the lid, an extended lip and an hourglass ridge. Currently, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, Samuel Adams Seasonal beers, Samuel Adams Rebel beers and some of the A&S Brewing beers are available in this uniquely-designed can. 
 In late 2011, the Company formed a subsidiary, A&S Brewing Collaborative LLC, d/b/a A&S Brewing, as a craft brew incubator headed by Alan Newman, founder of Magic Hat Brewing Company. A&S Brewing is headquartered in Burlington, Vermont. The mission of A&S Brewing is to find new opportunities in craft brewing, which may be geographical or stylistic and some may be with existing breweries or brewpubs. A&S Brewing has access to the brewing talents and broad resources of the Company, as it looks for opportunities around the country. A&S Brewing brands include The Traveler Beer Company, the Angel City Brewery, the Concrete Beach Brewery and the Coney Island Brewery. The A&S Brewing company-owned small breweries are located in Los Angeles, California (the Angel City Brewery), Miami, Florida (the Concrete Beach Brewery) and Brooklyn, New York (the Coney Island Brewery). In late 2016, Alan Newman left the Company, as planned under his five year employment agreement, and the Company will continue the A&S Brewing business and mission under the new leadership of Rob Kreszswick, who, prior to his promotion, had been leading A&S Brewing sales since 2014. In 2016, A&S Brewing annual net sales were approximately 4% of the Companys total net sales. 
 Sales, Distribution and Marketing 
 Most all of the Companys sales are made to a network of approximately 350 wholesalers in the United States and to a network of foreign wholesalers, importers or other agencies (collectively referred to as Distributors). These Distributors, in turn, sell the products to retailers, such as pubs, restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, package stores, stadiums and other retail outlets, where the products are sold to drinkers, and in some limited circumstances to parties who act as sub-distributors. The Company sells its products predominantly in the United States, but also has markets in Canada, Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and Central and South America. 
 With few exceptions, the Companys products are not the primary brands in its Distributors portfolios. Thus, the Company, in addition to competing with other beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers for a share of the drinkers business, competes with other brewers for a share of the Distributors attention, time and selling efforts. During 2016, the Companys largest customer accounted for approximately 7% of the Companys net sales. The top three Distributors collectively accounted for approximately 12% of the Companys net sales. In some states and countries, the terms of the Companys contracts with its Distributors may be affected by laws that restrict the enforcement of some contract terms, especially those related to the Companys right to terminate the relationship. 
 Most products are shipped within days of completion and there has not been any significant product order backlog. The Company has historically received most of its orders from domestic Distributors in the first week of a month for products to be shipped the following month and the Distributor would then carry three to five weeks of packaged inventory (usually at ambient temperatures) and three to four weeks of draft inventory. 
 In an effort to reduce both, the time and temperature the Companys beers experience at Distributor warehouses before reaching the retail market, in late 2010 the Company introduced its Freshest Beer Program with domestic 
 
4 
 
 Distributors in several markets. The goal of the Freshest Beer Program is to provide better on-time service, forecasting, production planning and cooperation with the Distributors, while substantially reducing inventory levels at the Distributor. At the close of its 2016 fiscal year, the Company had 159 Distributors participating in the program, which constitutes approximately 77% of its volume. The Company has successfully reduced the inventories of participating Distributors in the aggregate by approximately two weeks, resulting in fresher beer being delivered to retail. The Freshest Beer Program has resulted in lower shipments of approximately 270,000, 87,000, and 103,000 case equivalents in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as measured at the end of the year by evaluating the year-on-year inventory reduction from the inventory levels that might otherwise have been expected. In 2015 and 2016, the Company has been piloting a small group of distributors on a pure replenishment service model within our Freshest Beer Program, which if successful would further reduce Distributor inventories. The ordering process has changed significantly for Distributors that participate in the Freshest Beer Program and has resulted in a shorter period between order placement and shipment. There are various risks associated with the Freshest Beer Program that are discussed in Risk Factors below. 
 Boston Beer has a sales force of approximately 415 people, which the Company believes is one of the largest in the domestic beer industry. The Companys sales organization is designed to develop and strengthen relations at the Distributor, retailer and drinker levels by providing educational and promotional programs. The Companys sales force has a high level of product knowledge and is trained in the details of the brewing and selling processes. Sales representatives typically carry samples of the Companys beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers, certain ingredients, such as hops and barley, and other promotional materials to educate wholesale and retail buyers about the quality and taste of the Companys products. The Company has developed strong relationships with its Distributors and retailers, many of which have benefited from the Companys premium pricing strategy and growth. 
 The Company also engages in media campaigns  including television, radio, digital and social media, billboards and print. These media efforts are complemented by participation in sponsorships of cultural and community events, local beer festivals, industry-related trade shows and promotional events at local establishments, to the extent permitted under local laws and regulations. The Company uses a wide array of point-of-sale items (banners, neons, umbrellas, glassware, display pieces, signs and menu stands) designed to stimulate impulse sales and continued awareness. 
 In 2008, the Company launched its core philanthropic initiative, Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream®. In partnership with ACCION, the nations largest non-profit micro-lender, the program supports small business owners in the food, beverage, and brewing industries through access to business capital, coaching, and new market opportunities. The goal is to help strengthen small businesses, create local jobs and build vibrant communities. Since the inception of the Samuel Adams Brewing the American Dream program, Samuel Adams and ACCION have worked together to loan more than $14.5 million to nearly 1,200 small business owners who have subsequently repaid these loans at a rate of more than 97%. Samuel Adams employees, together with local business partners and community organizations, have provided coaching and mentoring to more than 7,000 business owners across the country. These efforts have helped to create or maintain more than 4,700 local jobs. 
 Ingredients and Packaging 
 The Company has been successful to date in obtaining sufficient quantities of the ingredients used in the production of its beverages. These ingredients include: 
 Malt. The two-row varieties of barley used in the Companys malt are mainly grown in the United States and Canada. The 2015 North American barley crop, which supported most 2016 malt needs, was below historical long term averages with regards to both quality and quantity, driven by acreage declines and adverse weather events in key barley growing areas. The 2016 North American barley crop, which will support 2017 malt needs, was generally consistent with historical long term averages with regards to both quality and quantity, though quality from key areas in Canada was highly variable and in some cases below long term averages. The average 
 
5 
 
 booked 2015 and 2016 barley crop prices were comparable to historical long term averages. There has been a long-term trend of declining acres and production in North America against relatively stable malt demand. The Company purchased most of the malt used in the production of its beer from two suppliers during 2016. The Company currently has a multi-year contract with one of its suppliers and a one year agreement with the other supplier. The Company also believes that there are other malt suppliers available that are capable of supplying its needs. 
 Hops. The Company uses Noble hop varieties for many of its Samuel Adams beers and also uses hops grown in the United States, England, and New Zealand. Noble hops are grown in several specific areas recognized for growing hops with superior taste and aroma properties. These include Hallertau-Hallertauer, Tettnang-Tettnanger, Hersbrucker and Spalt-Spalter from Germany and Saaz from the Czech Republic. The United States hops, grown primarily in the Pacific Northwest, namely Cascade, Simcoe®, Centennial, Chinook, Citra®, Amarillo®, and Mosaic® are used in certain Company ales and lagers, as are the Southern Hemisphere hop varieties, Galaxy and Nelson Sauvin. Traditional English hops, namely, East Kent Goldings and Fuggles, are also used in certain Company ales. Other hop sources and varieties including new experimental varieties such as HBC 566 and HBC 682 are also tested from time to time and used in certain beers. 
 The European hop crop harvested in 2016 was well above historical long term averages with regards to both quality and quantity due to favorable temperatures and precipitation. The United States hop crop harvested in 2016 was consistent with historical long term averages with regards to quality, with an increase in overall quantity driven by expansion of planted acres in recent years. However, the demand for certain hops grown in the United States has risen dramatically due to the success and proliferation of craft brewers and the popularity of beer styles that include hop varieties grown in the United States, with the result that prices continue to rise for both spot purchases and forward contract pricing and occasionally certain United States hops are in tight supply until the next crop or beyond. 
 The Company enters into purchase commitments with eight primary hop dealers, based on the Companys projected future volumes and brewing needs. The dealers either have the hops that are committed or will contract with farmers to meet the Companys needs. The contracts with the hop dealers are denominated in Euros for the German and Czech Republic hops, in Pounds Sterling for the English hops, US Dollars for United States hops and New Zealand Dollars for the New Zealand hops. The Company does not currently hedge its forward currency commitments. 
 The Company expects to realize full delivery on European, United States and New Zealand hop contracts on the hop crop harvested in 2016. The Company attempts to maintain a one to two-year supply of essential hop varieties on-hand in order to limit the risk of an unexpected reduction in supply. 
 The Company believes it has adequate inventory and commitments for all hop varieties. This belief is based on expected growth and beer style mix, all of which could ultimately be significantly different from what is currently planned. Variations to plan could result in hops shortages for specific beers or an excess of certain hops varieties. 
 The Company stores its hops in multiple cold storage warehouses to minimize the impact of a catastrophe at a single site. 
 Yeast. The Company uses multiple yeast strains for production of its beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers. While some strains are commercially available, other strains are proprietary. Since the proprietary strains cannot be replaced if destroyed, the Company protects these strains by storing multiple cultures of the same strain at different production locations and in several independent laboratories. 
 Apples. The Company uses special varieties and origins of apples in its hard ciders that it believes are important for their flavor profile. In 2016, these apples were sourced primarily from European, United States and New 
 
6 
 
 Zealand suppliers and include bittersweet apples from France and New Zealand and culinary apples from Italy and Washington State. Purchases and commitments are denominated in Euros for European apples, US Dollars for United States apples and New Zealand Dollars for the New Zealand apples. There is limited availability of some of these apple varieties, and many outside factors, including weather conditions, growers rotating from apples to other crops, competitor demand, government regulation and legislation affecting agriculture, could affect both price and supply. The 2016 apple crops in Europe, the United States and New Zealand were consistent with historical long term averages. The Company has entered into contracts to cover its expected needs for 2017 and expects to realize full delivery against these contracts. 
 The Company purchased and opened its cidery at the Orchard in 2015. The Company expects to use the apple varieties harvested at the Orchard to experiment and develop new hard ciders and for resale to customers. The Company may also use the apples harvested at the Orchard in small quantities in the Companys current hard ciders, but, given the current volume and varieties of apples grown at the Orchard, such use is likely to be insignificant. 
 Other Ingredients. The Company maintains competitive sources for most of the other ingredients used in the production of its beverages. 
 Packaging Materials. The Company maintains competitive sources for the supply of certain packaging materials, such as shipping cases and glass. The Company enters into limited-term supply agreements with certain vendors in order to receive preferential pricing. In 2016, cans, crowns, six pack carriers and labels were each supplied by a single source; however, the Company believes that alternative suppliers are available. 
 The Company initiates bottle deposits in some states and reuses glass bottles that are returned pursuant to certain state bottle recycling laws. The Company derives some economic benefit from its reuse of returned glass bottles. The cost associated with reusing the glass varies based on the costs of collection, sorting and handling, including arrangements with retailers, Distributors and dealers in recycled products. There is no guarantee that the current economics relating to the use of returned glass will continue or that the Company will continue to reuse returnable bottles. 
 Quality Assurance 
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed over fifteen brew masters to monitor the Companys brewing operations and control the production of its beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers. Extensive tests, tastings and evaluations are typically required to ensure that each batch of the Companys beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers conforms to the Companys standards. The Company has on-site quality control labs at each of its Samuel Adams Company-owned breweries, and supports the smaller local breweries with additional centralized lab services. 
 With the exception of certain specialty products, the Company includes a clearly legible freshness code on every bottle, can and keg of its beers, in order to ensure that its customers enjoy only the freshest products. Boston Beer was the first American brewer to use this practice. 
 Beer, Hard Cider and Hard Seltzer Production Strategy 
 During 2016, the Company brewed, fermented and packaged over 95% of its volume at breweries owned by the Company. The Company made capital investments in 2016 of approximately $49.9 million. These investments were made mostly in the Companys breweries to drive efficiencies and cost reductions, support product innovation and future growth. The Company expects to invest between $40 million and $60 million in 2017, which is highly dependent on future volume and mix estimates and the capital investments to meet those volume estimates. The actual amount spent may well be different from these estimates. 
 
7 
 
The Company also engages in various product development activities. Such activities include researching market needs and competitive products, and sample brewing and market taste testing. 
 The Pennsylvania Brewery and the Cincinnati Brewery produce most of the Companys shipment volume. The Pennsylvania Brewery is the Companys largest brewery and the Cincinnati Brewery is the primary brewery for the production of most of the Companys specialty and lower volume products. The Boston Brewerys production is mainly for developing new types of innovative and traditional beers and brewing and packaging beers for retail sales on site and in the local market area. 
 The Companys Angry Orchard Innovation Cider House located at the Orchard in Walden, New York, opened in November 2015 and its production is mainly for developing new types of innovative hard ciders and fermenting and packaging ciders for retail sales on site and in the local market area. 
 The A&S Brewing breweries include the Angel City Brewery, Concrete Beach Brewery and Coney Island Brewery. The production at the A&S Brewing breweries is mainly for developing innovative and traditional beers and supporting draft accounts in the respective local market areas and providing for on-premise consumption of its beers at its beer halls. 
 The Company currently has a brewing services agreement with subsidiaries of City Brewing Company, LLC, to produce its products at facilities in Latrobe, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee. The Company carefully selects breweries and packaging facilities owned by others with (i) the capability of utilizing traditional brewing, fermenting and finishing methods and (ii) first-rate quality control capabilities throughout the process. Under its brewing and packaging arrangements with third parties, the Company is charged a service fee based on units produced at each of the facilities and bears the costs of raw materials, risk, excise taxes and deposits for pallets and kegs and specialized equipment required to produce and package the Companys beverages. 
 The Company believes that it has alternatives available to it, in the event that production at any of its locations is interrupted, although severe interruptions at the Pennsylvania Brewery would be problematic, especially in seasonal peak periods. In addition, the Company may not be able to maintain its current economics if interruptions were to occur, and could face significant delays in starting up replacement production locations. Potential interruptions at breweries include labor issues, governmental actions, quality issues, contractual disputes, machinery failures, operational shut downs, or natural or unavoidable catastrophes. Also, as the brewing industry has consolidated and the Company has grown, the capacity and willingness of breweries owned by others where the Company could produce some of its beers, hard ciders and hard seltzers, if necessary, has become a more significant concern. The Company would work with its contract brewers to attempt to minimize any potential disruptions. 
 Competition 
 The Better Beer category within the United States beer market is highly competitive due to the increasing number of craft brewers, imported beers with similar pricing and target drinkers, and efforts by large domestic brewers to enter this category. The Company anticipates competition and innovation among domestic craft brewers to remain strong, as craft brewers experienced their twelfth successive year of growth in 2016 and there were many new startups. The Company estimates there are over 6,500 craft breweries in operation or in the planning stages, up from approximately 1,409 operating craft breweries in 2006. Also, established craft breweries are building more capacity, expanding geographically, and adding more SKUs and styles, as Distributors and retailers are promoting and making more shelf space available for more craft beer brands. 
 Imported beers, such as Corona®, Heineken® and Modelo Especial®, continue to compete aggressively in the United States and have gained market share over the last ten years. Heineken and Constellation Brands (owner of the United States Distribution rights to Corona and Modelo Especial) may have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company has. The two largest brewers in the 
 
8 
 
 United States, MillerCoors and AB InBev, participate actively in the Better Beer category both through importing and distributing foreign brands that compete in the Better Beer category, and also with their own domestic specialty beers, either by developing new brands or by acquiring, in whole or part, existing craft breweries. In addition, Miller Coors Tenth and Blake and AB InBevs High End Division were formed as business units headquartered in the United States that are focused exclusively on competing in the Better Beer market. 
 During the last few years, there were numerous acquisitions in the beer industry with the largest being AB InBevs $107 billion purchase of SAB Miller and the related sale by SAB Miller to MolsonCoors of its 58% share of the MillerCoors joint venture with MolsonCoors. There were also numerous announcements of acquisitions of or investments in craft brewers by larger breweries, private equity and other investors. The most significant include Heinekens acquisition of a 50% interest in Lagunitas Brewing Company for approximately $500 million, Constellation Brands acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits for approximately $1 billion, AB InBevs purchase of multiple craft breweries, including Elysian Brewing Company, Golden Road Brewing, Four Peaks Brewing Company, Breckenridge Brewing, Devils Backbone and Karbach and MillerCoors purchase of multiple craft breweries, including Hop Valley Brewing, Saint Archer Brewery and Revolver Brewing. Pabst Brewing Company acquired an ownership interest in and entered into an exclusive agreement to distribute nationally Small Town Brewerys brands, including Not Your Fathers Hard Root Beer®, and entered into an agreement to distribute various United States cider brands of C&C Group PLC, including Woodchuck, Magners and Hornsbys. AB InBev also acquired Spiked Seltzer, a previously independent hard seltzer company. 
 The Companys products also compete with other alcoholic beverages for drinker attention and consumption and the pace of innovation in the categories in which the Company competes is increasing. In recent years, wine and spirits have been competing more directly with beers. The Company monitors such activity and attempts to develop strategies which benefit from the drinkers interest in trading up, in order to position its beers and hard ciders competitively with wine and spirits. 
 The Company competes with other beer and alcoholic beverage companies within a three-tier distribution system. The Company competes for a share of the Distributors attention, time and selling efforts. In retail establishments, the Company competes for shelf, cold box and tap space. From a drinker perspective, competition exists for brand acceptance and loyalty. The principal factors of competition in the Better Beer segment of the beer industry include product quality and taste, brand advertising and imagery, trade and drinker promotions, pricing, packaging and the development of new products. 
 The Company distributes its products through independent Distributors who also distribute competitors products. Certain brewers have contracts with their Distributors that impose requirements on the Distributors that are intended to maximize the Distributors attention, time and selling efforts on that brewers products. These contracts generally result in increased competition among brewers as the contracts may affect the manner in which a Distributor allocates selling effort and investment to the brands included in its portfolio. The Company closely monitors these and other trends in its Distributor network and works to develop programs and tactics intended to best position its products in the market. 
 The Company has certain competitive advantages over the regional craft brewers, including a long history of awards for product quality, greater available resources and the ability to distribute and promote its products on a more cost-effective basis. Additionally, the Company believes it has competitive advantages over imported beers, including lower transportation costs, higher product quality, a lack of import charges and superior product freshness. 
 The Companys Twisted Tea product line competes primarily within the FMB category of the beer industry. FMBs, such as Twisted Tea, Smirnoff Ice®, Mikes Hard Lemonade®, Bud Light Lime® Ritas, and Redds Apple Ale® are flavored malt beverages that are typically priced competitively with Better Beers. This category is highly competitive due to, among other factors, the presence of large brewers and spirits companies in the

 Regulation and Taxation 
 The alcoholic beverage industry is regulated by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern the production, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, marketing and advertising. To operate its production facilities, the Company must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including but not limited to, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the Food and Drug Administration, state alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. 
 Governmental entities may levy various taxes, license fees and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The federal excise tax on malt beverages is $18 per barrel, on hard cider (with alcohol by volume of 7% or less) is $0.226 per gallon, on hard cider (with non-qualifying fermentable fruits) is $1.07 per gallon, and on artificially carbonated wine (hard cider with high CO2 levels) is $3.30 per gallon. States levy excise taxes at varying rates based on the type of beverage and alcohol content. Failure by the Company to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals. While there can be no assurance that any such regulatory action would not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or its operating results, the Company is not aware of any infraction affecting any of its licenses or permits that would materially impact its ability to continue its current operations.

Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations and Operating Considerations 
 The Companys operations are subject to a variety of extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse effects on human health or the environment. Environmental laws, regulations or ordinances may impose liability for the cost of remediation of, and for certain damages resulting from, sites of past releases of hazardous materials. The Company believes that it currently conducts, and in the past has conducted, its activities and operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, and believes that any costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 
 As part of its efforts to be environmentally friendly, the Company has reused its glass bottles returned from certain states that have bottle deposit bills. The Company believes that it benefits economically from washing and reusing these bottles, which result in a lower cost than purchasing new glass, and that it benefits the environment by the reduction in landfill usage, the reduction of usage of raw materials and the lower utility costs for reusing bottles versus producing new bottles. The economics of using recycled glass varies based on the cost of collection, sorting and handling, and may be affected by local regulation, and retailer, Distributor and glass dealer behavior. There is no guarantee that the current economics of using returned glass will continue, or that the Company will continue its current used glass practices. 
 The Company has adopted various policies and procedures intended to ensure that its facilities meet occupational health and safety requirements. The Company believes that it currently is in compliance with applicable requirements and will continue to endeavor to remain in compliance. There can be no assurances, however, that new and more restrictive requirements might not be adopted, compliance with which might have a material, adverse financial effect on the Company and its operating results, or that such policies and procedures will be consistently followed and be sufficient to prevent serious accidents.
