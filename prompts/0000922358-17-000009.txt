ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview

Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1994 and is primarily engaged in:

• | the retail distribution of propane and related equipment sales, and


• | midstream operations.

Our common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FGP", and our activities are primarily conducted through our operating partnership, Ferrellgas, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. We are the sole limited partner of Ferrellgas, L.P. with an approximate 99% limited partner interest.

2

Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners’ only significant assets are its approximate 99% limited partnership interest in the operating partnership and its 100% equity interest in Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. 

The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings, except for interest expense related to the senior notes co-issued by Ferrellgas Partners and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp.
Our general partner performs all management functions for us and holds a 1% general partner interest in Ferrellgas Partners and an approximate 1% general partner interest in the operating partnership. The parent company of our general partner, Ferrell Companies, currently beneficially owns approximately 23.4% of our outstanding common units. Ferrell Companies is owned 100% by an employee stock ownership trust.
In fiscal 2017, no one customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues.
Financial covenants
As more fully described in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis under the subheading “Financial Covenants”, the indenture governing the outstanding notes of Ferrellgas Partners and the agreements governing the operating partnership’s indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and make distribution payments to our common unitholders. Given the limitations and the lack of headroom on these covenants, we continue to execute on a strategy to reduce our debt and interest expense. If we are unsuccessful with our strategy to reduce debt and interest expense, or are unsuccessful in renegotiating our secured credit facility, which matures in October 2018, or are unable to secure alternative liquidity sources, we may not have the liquidity to fund our operations after that maturity date. 
Our Businesses
Propane operations and related equipment sales
We are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers in the United States. We believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States as measured by the volume of our retail sales in fiscal 2017 and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. 
We serve residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our operations primarily include the distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States. Sales from propane distribution are generated principally from transporting propane purchased from third parties to propane distribution locations and then to tanks on customers’ premises or to portable propane tanks delivered to nationwide and local retailers. Sales from portable tank exchanges, nationally branded under the name Blue Rhino, are generated through a network of independent and partnership-owned distribution outlets. Our market areas for our residential and agricultural customers are generally rural while our market areas for our industrial/commercial and portable tank exchange customers are generally urban.

In the residential and industrial/commercial markets, propane is primarily used for space heating, water heating, cooking and other propane fueled appliances. In the portable tank exchange market, propane is used primarily for outdoor cooking using gas grills. In the agricultural market, propane is primarily used for crop drying, space heating, irrigation and weed control. In addition, propane is used for a variety of industrial applications, including as an engine fuel burned in the internal combustion engines of vehicles and forklifts and as a heating or energy source in manufacturing and drying processes.
A substantial majority of our gross margin from propane and other gas liquids sales is derived from the distribution and sale of propane and related risk management activities. Our gross margin from the retail distribution of propane is primarily based on the cents-per-gallon difference between the sales price we charge our customers and our costs to purchase and deliver propane to our propane distribution locations. 
The distribution of propane to residential customers generally involves large numbers of small volume deliveries. Our retail deliveries of propane are typically transported from our retail propane distribution locations to our customers by our fleet of bulk delivery trucks, which are generally fitted with tanks ranging in size from 2,600 to 3,500 gallons. Propane storage tanks located on our customers' premises are then filled from these bulk delivery trucks. We also deliver propane to our industrial/commercial and portable tank exchange customers using our fleet of portable tank and portable tank exchange delivery trucks, truck tractors and portable tank exchange delivery trailers.
3

We track “Propane sales volumes,” “Revenues – Propane and other gas liquids sales” and “Gross Margin – Propane and other gas liquids sales” by customer; however, we are not able to specifically allocate operating and other costs by customer in a manner that would determine their specific profitability with a high degree of accuracy. The wholesale propane price per gallon is subject to various market conditions, including inflation, and may fluctuate based on changes in demand, supply and other energy commodity prices, primarily crude oil and natural gas, as propane prices tend to correlate with the fluctuations of these underlying commodities.

As of July 31, 2017, approximately 51% of our residential customers rent their tanks from us. Our rental terms and the fire safety regulations in some states require rented bulk tanks to be filled only by the propane supplier owning the tank. The cost and inconvenience of switching bulk tanks helps minimize a customer’s tendency to switch suppliers of propane on the basis of minor variations in price, helping us minimize customer loss.
In addition, we lease tanks to some of our independent distributors involved with our delivery of propane for portable tank exchanges. Our owned and independent distributors provide portable tank exchange customers with a national delivery presence that is generally not available from most of our competitors.
In our past three fiscal years, our total annual propane sales volumes in gallons were:

Fiscal year ended | Propane sales volumes (in millions)
July 31, 2017 | 791 
July 31, 2016 | 779 
July 31, 2015 | 879 

We utilize marketing programs targeting both new and existing customers by emphasizing:

• | our efficiency in delivering propane to customers;


• | our employee training and safety programs;


• | our enhanced customer service, facilitated by our technology platform and our 24 hours a day, seven days a week emergency retail customer call support capabilities; and


• | our national distributor network for our commercial and portable tank exchange customers.

Some of our propane distribution locations also conduct the retail sale of propane appliances and related parts and fittings, as well as other retail propane related services and consumer products. We also sell gas grills, grilling tools and accessories, patio heaters, fireplace and garden accessories, mosquito traps and other outdoor products through Blue Rhino Global Sourcing, Inc.

Our other activities in our propane operations and related equipment sales segment include the following:

• | the sale of refined fuels, and


• | common carrier services.


Effect of Weather and Seasonality

Weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes during the months of November through March (the “winter heating season”). Accordingly, the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year. In any given region, sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures in the winter heating season will tend to result in reduced propane usage, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures in the winter heating season will tend to result in greater usage. Although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage, general economic conditions in the United States and the wholesale price of propane can also significantly impact this correlation. Additionally, there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers. If the United States were to experience a cooling trend we could expect nationwide demand for propane for heating purposes to increase which could lead to greater sales, income and liquidity availability. Conversely, if the United States were to experience a continued warming trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane for heating purposes to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales, income and liquidity availability as well as impact our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.

The market for propane is seasonal because of increased demand during the winter heating season primarily for the purpose of providing heating in residential and commercial buildings. Consequently, sales and operating profits are concentrated in our 
4

second and third fiscal quarters, which are during the winter heating season. However, our propane by portable tank exchange business experiences higher volumes in the spring and summer, which include the majority of the grilling season. These volumes add to our operating profits during our first and fourth fiscal quarters due to those counter-seasonal business activities. These sales also provide us the ability to better utilize our seasonal resources at our propane distribution locations. Other factors affecting our results of operations include competitive conditions, volatility in energy commodity prices, demand for propane, timing of acquisitions and general economic conditions in the United States.
We use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal. We use the definition of “normal” temperatures based on information published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”). Based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days. Heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage.

We believe that our broad geographic distribution helps us reduce exposure to regional weather and economic patterns. During times of colder-than-normal winter weather, we have been able to take advantage of our large, efficient distribution network to avoid supply disruptions, thereby providing us a competitive advantage in the markets we serve.

Risk Management Activities – Commodity Price Risk

We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short-term basis. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment.

Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical products market in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets. Our propane related financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. 

Our risk management activities may include the use of financial derivative instruments including, but not limited to, swaps, options, and futures to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses. We enter into these financial derivative instruments directly with third parties in the over-the-counter market and with brokers who are clearing members with the Intercontinental Exchange or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. We also enter into forward propane purchase and sales contracts with counterparties. These forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception within accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and are therefore not recorded on our financial statements until settled.

Through our supply procurement activities, we purchase propane primarily from energy companies. Supplies of propane from these sources have traditionally been readily available, although no assurance can be given that they will be readily available in the future. We may purchase and store inventories of propane to avoid delivery interruptions during the periods of increased demand and to take advantage of favorable commodity prices. As a result of our ability to buy large volumes of propane and utilize our national distribution system, we believe we are in a position to achieve product cost savings and avoid shortages during periods of tight supply to an extent not generally available to other propane distributors. During fiscal 2017, seven suppliers accounted for approximately 67% of our total propane purchases. Because there are numerous alternative suppliers available, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that this supplier concentration could cause a near-term severe impact on our ability to procure propane, though propane prices could be affected; however, if supplies were interrupted or difficulties in obtaining alternative transportation were to arise, the cost of procuring replacement supplies may materially increase. These transactions are accounted for at cost in “Cost of product sold – propane and other gas liquids sales” in our consolidated statement of earnings.

A portion of our propane inventory is purchased under supply contracts that typically have a one-year term and a price that fluctuates based on spot market prices. In order to limit overall price risk, we will enter into fixed price over-the-counter propane forward and/or swap contracts that generally have terms of less than 36 months. We may also use options to hedge a portion of our forecasted purchases, which generally do not exceed 36 months in the future.

We also incur risks related to the price and availability of propane during periods of much colder-than-normal weather, temporary supply shortages concentrated in certain geographic regions and commodity price distortions between geographic regions. We attempt to mitigate these risks through our transportation activities by utilizing our transport truck and railroad tank car fleet to distribute propane between supply or storage locations and propane distribution locations. The propane we sell to our 
5

customers is generally transported from gas processing plants and refineries, pipeline terminals and storage facilities to propane distribution locations or storage facilities by our leased railroad tank cars, our owned or leased highway transport trucks, common carrier, or owner-operated transport trucks.

Industry

Natural gas liquids are derived from petroleum products and are sold in compressed or liquefied form. Propane, the predominant natural gas liquid, is typically extracted from natural gas or separated during crude oil refining. Although propane is gaseous at normal pressures, it is compressed into liquid form at relatively low pressures for storage and transportation. Propane is a clean-burning energy source, recognized for its transportability and ease of use relative to alternative forms of stand-alone energy sources.

Based upon industry publications propane accounts for approximately 3% to 4% of energy consumption in the United States, a level which has remained relatively constant for the past two decades. Propane competes primarily with natural gas, electricity and fuel oil as an energy source principally on the basis of price, availability and portability. Propane serves as an alternative to natural gas in rural and urban areas where natural gas is unavailable or portability of product is required. Propane is generally more expensive than natural gas on an equivalent British Thermal Unit (“BTU”) basis in locations served by natural gas, although propane is often sold in such areas as a standby fuel for use during peak demands and during interruption in natural gas service. The expansion of natural gas into traditional propane markets has historically been inhibited by the capital costs required to expand distribution and pipeline systems. Although the extension of natural gas pipelines tends to displace propane distribution in the neighborhoods affected, we believe that new opportunities for propane sales arise as more geographically remote neighborhoods are developed.

Propane has historically been less expensive to use than electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking and competes effectively with electricity in the parts of the country where propane is less expensive than electricity on an equivalent BTU basis. Although propane is similar to fuel oil in application, market demand and price, propane and fuel oil have generally developed their own distinct geographic markets. Because residential furnaces and appliances that burn propane will not operate on fuel oil, a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment. Residential propane customers will have an incentive to switch to fuel oil only if fuel oil becomes significantly less expensive than propane. Conversely, we may be unable to expand our retail customer base in areas where fuel oil is widely used, particularly the northeast United States, unless propane becomes significantly less expensive than fuel oil. However, many industrial customers who use propane as a heating fuel have the capacity to switch to other fuels, such as fuel oil, on the basis of availability or minor variations in price.
Risk Management Activities – Transportation Fuel Price Risk

From time to time, we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase of gasoline and diesel fuel for use in the transport of propane from supply or storage locations and from retail fueling stations. When employed, we attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments.

When employed, our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the financial markets that are not more than the forecasted purchases of fuel for our internal use in both the supply and retail propane delivery fleet in order to minimize the risk of decreased earnings from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy locks in our purchase price and is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the financial markets. Our transport fuel financial derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges.

Competition

In addition to competing with marketers of other fuels, we compete with other companies engaged in the propane distribution business. Competition within the propane distribution industry stems from two types of participants: the larger, multi-state marketers, including farmers’ cooperatives, and the smaller, local independent marketers, including rural electric cooperatives. Based on our propane sales volumes in fiscal 2017, we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange.

Most of our retail propane distribution locations compete with three or more marketers or distributors, primarily on the basis of reliability of service and responsiveness to customer needs, safety and price. Each retail distribution outlet operates in its own competitive environment because propane marketers typically reside in close proximity to their customers to lower the cost of providing service.
Business Strategy
6

Our business strategy for this segment is to:


• | Expand our operations through disciplined acquisitions and internal growth, as accretive opportunities become available;


• | capitalize on our national presence and economies of scale; and


• | maximize operating efficiencies through utilization of our technology platform.


Expand our operations through disciplined acquisitions and internal growth, as accretive opportunities become available

We expect to continue the expansion of our propane customer base through both the acquisition of other propane distributors and through organic growth. We intend to concentrate on propane acquisition activities in geographical areas within or adjacent to our existing operating areas, and on a selected basis in areas that broaden our geographic coverage. We also intend to focus on acquisitions that can be efficiently combined with our existing propane operations to provide an attractive return on investment after taking into account the economies of scale and cost savings we anticipate will result from those combinations. 
Our goal is to improve the operations and profitability of our propane operations and related equipment sales segment by integrating best practices and leveraging our established national organization and technology platforms to help reduce costs and enhance customer service. We believe that our enhanced operational synergies, improved customer service and ability to better track the financial performance of operations provide us a distinct competitive advantage and better analysis as we consider future opportunities.
We believe that we are positioned to successfully compete for growth opportunities within and outside of our existing operating regions. Our efforts will focus on adding density to our existing customer base, providing propane and complementary services to national accounts and providing other product offerings to existing customer relationships. This continued expansion will give us new growth opportunities by leveraging the capabilities of our operating platforms.
Capitalize on our national presence and economies of scale

We believe our national presence of 789 propane distribution locations in the United States as of July 31, 2017 gives us advantages over our smaller competitors. These advantages include economies of scale in areas such as:


• | product procurement;


• | transportation;


• | fleet purchases;


• | propane customer administration; and


• | general administration.

We believe that our national presence allows us to be one of the few propane distributors that can competitively serve industrial/commercial and portable tank exchange customers on a nationwide basis, including the ability to serve such propane customers through leading home-improvement centers, mass merchants and hardware, grocery and convenience stores. In addition, we believe that our national presence provides us opportunities to make acquisitions of other propane distribution companies whose operations  overlap with ours, providing economies of scale and significant cost savings in these markets.

We also believe that investments in technology similar to ours require both a large scale and a national presence, in order to generate sustainable operational savings to produce a sufficient return on investment. For these reasons, we believe our national presence and economies of scale provide us with an on-going competitive advantage.

Maximize operating efficiencies through utilization of our technology platform

We believe our significant investments in technology give us a competitive advantage to operate more efficiently and effectively at a lower cost compared to most of our competitors. We do not believe that many of our competitors will be able to justify similar investments in the near term. Our technology advantage has resulted from significant investments made in our retail propane distribution operating platform together with our state-of-the-art tank exchange operating platform.

Our technology platform allows us to efficiently route and schedule our customer deliveries, customer administration and operational workflow for the retail sale and delivery of bulk propane. Our service centers are staffed to provide oversight and management to multiple distribution locations, referred to as service units. We operate a retail distribution network, including portable tank exchange operations, using a structure of 61 service centers and 789 service units as of July 31, 2017. The service unit locations utilize hand-held computers and cellular or satellite technology to communicate with management personnel who 
7

are typically located at the associated service center. We believe this structure and our technology platform allow us to more efficiently route and schedule customer deliveries and significantly reduce the need for daily on-site management.
The efficiencies gained from operating our technology platform allow us to consolidate our management teams at fewer locations, quickly adjust the sales prices to our customers and manage our personnel and vehicle costs more effectively to meet customer demand.

Our customer support capabilities allow us to accept emergency customer calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week. These combined capabilities provide us cost savings while improving customer service by reducing customer inconvenience associated with multiple, unnecessary deliveries.

Governmental Regulation - Environmental and Safety Matters
Propane is not currently subject to any price or allocation regulation and has not been defined by any federal environmental law as an environmentally hazardous substance.

In connection with all acquisitions of propane distribution businesses that involve the purchase of real property, we conduct a due diligence investigation to attempt to determine whether any substance other than propane has been sold from, stored on or otherwise come into contact with any such real property prior to its purchase. At a minimum, due diligence includes questioning the sellers, obtaining representations and warranties concerning the sellers' compliance with environmental laws and visual inspections of the real property.
With respect to the sale and distribution of propane, we are subject to regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") under its Hazard Communication Standard ("HCS"), which requires preparation and maintenance of material safety data sheets, hazard labeling on products, and other worker protections. In 2012, OSHA promulgated new hazard communications requirements designed to align US HCS standards with those of other countries under a Globally Harmonized System (“GHS”). These hazard labeling and communication changes, which took effect in June 2015, required us and other propane manufacturers and distributors to revise and update our consumer and compliance materials. 

With respect to the transportation of propane by truck, we are subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations cover the transportation of flammable materials and are administered by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT"). The National Fire Protection Association Pamphlet No. 58 establishes a national standard for the safe handling and storage of propane. Those rules and procedures have been adopted by us and serve as the industry standard by the states in which we operate.

We believe that we are in material compliance with all governmental regulations and industry standards applicable to environmental and safety matters.
Midstream operations 
We conduct our crude oil logistics operations and related activity, as well as water solutions operations, under our Midstream operations reportable segment. 
Crude oil logistics
Our crude oil logistics operations ("Bridger"), which we operate under the Bridger Logistics tradename, provides domestic crude oil transportation and logistics services with an integrated portfolio of midstream assets connecting crude oil production in multiple basins in the U.S. to downstream markets. Bridger's truck, pipeline terminal, pipeline and rail assets form a comprehensive, fee-for-service business model, and substantially all of its cash flow is generated from fee-based commercial agreements. 
Bridger's fee-based business model generates income by providing crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil with end markets across North America including a presence in major domestic crude oil basins. The first link in Bridger's integrated value chain is its truck transportation operations. Bridger charges producers and first purchasers of crude oil fees per barrel to transport crude from the wellhead to takeaway outlets, which provide connectivity to end markets and generate additional fee-for-service income. Bridger also owns or controls a number of assets connecting trucked crude volumes to downstream takeaway infrastructure, including pipeline injection terminals, crude storage, rail loading and unloading facilities, new build railcars and pipelines. 
8

Bridger also engages in the marketing of physical crude oil in the major production basins of the United States. Bridger purchases this crude oil from producers and transports it using a mix of its truck transportation and rail assets as well as terminal and pipeline contracts to the sale point with its customers.
Termination of Bridger agreement with Jamex Marketing, LLC
As more fully described in Item 7. Management's Discussion & Analysis under the subheading "Termination of Bridger agreement with Jamex Marketing, LLC", on September 1, 2016, Bridger and Ferrellgas entered into a series of agreements with one of its customers which had an adverse, material impact on Bridger's operations.
Business Strategy
Our current business strategy for this segment is to maximize profitability utilizing existing assets. The continued, sustained decline in the price of crude oil has had a negative impact on domestic crude oil production, and as a result, has had a negative impact on the volumes of crude oil that we transport. We are evaluating all phases of our business in light of these challenges with the goal of operating more efficiently.
We continue to evaluate alternatives to maximize profitability relative to rail car assets previously committed to the Jamex TLA and Bridger's largest customer and our trucking fleet which is currently operating under capacity. We believe this business strategy supports our overall current company strategy of reducing debt and interest expense and improving our leverage ratio.
Customers 
Bridger's customers include crude oil producers, refiners and marketers. Generally, Bridger seeks to enter into long-term contracts to provide logistics services; however, contracts for the transportation of crude oil by truck tend to be terminable on 30 days’ notice. 
A subsidiary of Bridger has entered into a series of agreements with a subsidiary of a large oil producer in the Permian Basin, to provide truck oil transportation services on a "right of first call" basis within an area of mutual interest covering a significant portion of the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico. The initial term of this agreement ends in 2019, then automatically extends for additional one-year periods during which time it may be terminated upon six months notice.
A subsidiary of Bridger has also entered into a take-or-pay throughput agreement with an entity in connection with one of Bridger's Rockies pipeline terminals, pursuant to which Bridger provides dedicated storage and throughput services to this entity at that pipeline terminal. This agreement is scheduled to terminate in 2019, with automatic annual extensions unless a party gives notice 180 days prior to the renewal date.
A subsidiary of Bridger has also entered into a series of agreements with a subsidiary of a large international oil company for the sale of crude oil. Bridger services this contract by purchasing crude from a variety of oil producers, primarily in the Niobrara region, and transporting it using a mix of its truck transportation and rail assets as well as terminal and pipeline contracts to the sale point with its customer in Cushing, Oklahoma.
Risk management activities - Crude oil price risk
Our risk management activities attempt to mitigate price risks related to our crude oil line fill and inventory. We may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the price of crude oil.
Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the financial markets that are equal and opposite to the forecasted crude oil line fill and inventory volume in order to minimize the risk of inventory price change. This risk management strategy locks in our sales price and is successful when our gains or losses on line fill or inventory are offset by our losses or gains in the financial markets. Our crude oil financial derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges.
Competition 
Bridger faces significant competition, as many entities are engaged in the crude oil logistics business, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. Bridger's ability to compete could be harmed by factors that it cannot control, including:

• | the perception that another company can provide better service;

9


• | the availability of crude oil alternative supply points, or crude oil supply points located closer to the operations of its customers; and


• | a decision by its competitors to develop, acquire or construct crude oil midstream assets and provide gathering, transportation, terminalling or storage services in geographic areas, or to customers, served by Bridger's assets and services.

Governmental Regulation - Environmental and Safety Matters
Bridger's crude oil logistics operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. As with the midstream industry generally, compliance with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases its overall cost of business, including its capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities, and even the issuance of injunctions that may restrict or prohibit some or all of its operations. We believe that Bridger's operations are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, resulting in potentially more stringent requirements, and we cannot provide any assurance that the cost of compliance with current and future laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or earnings associated with the Bridger's business.
In December 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") proposed lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") from the current 75 parts per billion ("PPB") level to between 65 and 70 PPB using an 8-hour average. On October 26, 2015, the EPA published its final rule lowering the ozone NAAQS to 70 PPB. This change could significantly expand the number of areas and counties deemed to be in nonattainment with federal ozone standards, and could force states to impose additional emissions controls on oil, gas and other industrial sectors.
In May 2015, the DOT issued final rules for oil-by-rail transportation requiring that certain older tank cars be phased out of operation and that new tank cars comply with certain design requirements. All tank cars built after October 1, 2015 must meet these new standards. DOT-111 tank cars must be retrofitted or replaced in accordance with a risk-based timeline starting on January 1, 2017 and CPC-1232 tank cars without insulating jackets must be retrofitted or replaced by April 1, 2020. Furthermore, in December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, which requires all tank cars to be upgraded by the DOT’s deadlines regardless of train composition. We estimate that it will cost approximately $30.0 million to bring Bridger's tank cars into compliance with the new standards.
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ("Corps"). On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of the jurisdiction of the EPA and the Corps over wetlands and other waters protected under the Clean Water Act. The rules have been challenged in court on the grounds that they unlawfully expand the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. Further, on February 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the relevant executive agencies to review the rules and to initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise them, as appropriate under the stated policies of protecting navigable waters from pollution while promoting economic growth, reducing uncertainty, and showing due regard for Congress and the states. On June 27, 2017, the EPA and the Corps announced a proposed rule to rescind the 2015 rules. To the extent the rule is not rescinded and expands the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, certain oil and gas companies could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. In addition, the process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters. Noncompliance with these requirements may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations.
The Federal Clean Air Act, or CAA, as amended, and analogous state and local laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants, and impose permit requirements and other obligations. Regulated emissions occur as a result of our operations, including the handling or storage of crude oil and other petroleum products. Both federal and state laws impose substantial penalties for violation of these applicable requirements. Accordingly, our failure to comply with these requirements could subject 
10

us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, revocation or suspension of necessary permits and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions.
In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs. The rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction of VOC emissions. On May 12, 2016, the EPA amended the NSPS to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements that were subject to reconsideration, including fugitive emission requirements. These standards, to the extent implemented, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects, and our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. 
Water solutions
Our water solutions operations ("Water solutions") generate revenues from treatment and disposal of salt water generated from crude oil production operations at our salt water disposal wells and from the sale of recovered crude oil from our skimming oil process. Our facilities are located near oil and gas production fields with high levels of crude oil and natural gas in the Eagle Ford Basin in Texas.
Our current strategy for our Water solutions business is to generate positive, future cash flows and generate organic growth by strategically leveraging assets in other lines of business, where appropriate. If we are unable to generate positive, future cash flows, we may consider other alternatives for this business including selling some or all of the business or business assets, temporarily idling facilities or permanently closing facilities. This could lead to future, material impairments or losses of long-lived assets.
Permits and Regulatory Compliance
We operate salt water disposal facilities in the Eagle Ford shale region of south Texas. Each of these facilities is permitted to inject non-hazardous oil and gas waste into an Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) Class II disposal well. These wells have been drilled in certain acceptable geologic formations far below the base of underground sources of fresh water to a point that is safely separated by other substantial geological confining layers according to environmental laws that are administered under the auspices of the federal government or states with primacy. 
Because the major component of this business is the disposal of oil and gas field residual salt water in an environmentally sound manner, a significant amount of our capital expenditures in this segment are related, either directly or indirectly, to environmental protection measures, including compliance with federal, state and local provisions that regulate the placement of oilfield residual salt water into the environment. There are costs associated with siting, design, operations, monitoring, site maintenance, corrective actions, financial assurance, and facility closure and post-closure obligations.
In connection with our acquisition, development or expansion of a Class II injection facility or transfer station, we must often spend considerable time, effort and money to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the issuing agency. Compliance with current and any future regulatory requirements could require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures. However, most of these expenditures would impact the entire industry and, accordingly, would not be expected to place us at any competitive disadvantage.
Governmental Regulation - Environmental and Safety Matters
Like the customers we service, our water solutions business is subject to extensive, complex and evolving federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that can affect the cost, manner, feasibility or timing of doing business. These laws and regulations are administered by the EPA and various other federal, state and local environmental, 
11

zoning, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies in the United States. The Texas Railroad Commission ("RRC") is the principal state agency that regulates our water solutions business in Texas.
Many of these agencies regularly examine and inspect our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations and have the power to enforce compliance, obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in case of violations. In recent years, the oil and gas industry that we serve has perceived an increase in both the amount of government regulation and the number of enforcement actions being brought by regulatory entities against operations in related industries. These increases in regulatory oversight can affect both the demand for our services and our ability to supplying services at an economically viable level.

The principal United States federal environmental, safety and health statutes affecting our business are summarized below. While the EPA retains oversight authority, in most cases the state of Texas has primary authority to administer regulatory and enforcement programs under each of these statutes, their state analogues and other state laws. The RRC has primary regulatory jurisdiction over the oil and natural gas industry and related industry sectors. Accordingly, the RRC is the principal state regulator of our water solutions business. Meanwhile, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is the principal state environmental regulator for virtually every other industry in the state, including industries that may have an effect on our business.
The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) is the primary statute that governs injection wells. The SDWA requires the EPA to protect underground sources of drinking water (“USDW”) from being endangered as a result of underground injection of fluids through a well. The EPA has promulgated standards by setting minimum requirements for injection wells, including Class II injection wells such as those owned and operated by us. The Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) provisions of the SDWA and implementing regulations control the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells that place fluids underground for storage or disposal. All injection must be authorized under either general or specific permits. Injection well owners and operators may not site, construct, operate, maintain, convert, plug, abandon, or conduct any other injection activity that endangers USDWs.
The SDWA allows a state to obtain primacy from the EPA for oil and gas related injection wells, either by adopting the federal UIC requirements or, under some circumstances without adopting the complete set of applicable federal UIC regulations. The state must be able to demonstrate that its existing regulatory program is protecting USDWs in that state, even if the regulations may not be as stringent as federal rules. Presently, at least 40 states, including Texas, have primacy approval from the EPA to regulate Class II injection wells for the disposal of oil and gas produced and flowback water. Requirements in primacy states may differ from and be more stringent than federal requirements. 
Certain states, including Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and well construction requirements on underground injection wells and/or hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban such activities altogether. For example, on October 28, 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, amongst other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the RRC’s authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. 
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and various reporting and record keeping obligations, as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, apply to our midstream operations. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose strict liability, without regard to fault or legality of the activity at the time, on certain classes of persons. These persons include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances, and persons that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. 
Under CERCLA, persons deemed "responsible persons" may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act 
12

in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims under common law for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), as amended, regulates the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Some wastes associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are exempted from more stringent regulation as "hazardous wastes" under the subtitle C of RCRA in certain circumstances. Wastes that may fall under this exemption include drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. However, these exempt wastes may still be regulated under other federal and state laws. Further, the exemption does not cover all materials that may be used at an oil and gas exploration, development or production site. In the ordinary course of our operations, we may generate other industrial wastes such as waste solvents and waste chemicals that may be regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA or considered hazardous substances under CERCLA. Compliance with RCRA and CERCLA imposes additional costs on our operations, and if these wastes are not properly disposed of in accordance with regulation, we may be subject to clean up orders, penalty actions or private lawsuits that may require us to expend additional resources.
In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing technically enhanced, naturally occurring radioactive materials, or “TENORM.” TENORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by TENORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. In addition, federal and state safety and health requirements impose limitations on worker exposure to TENORM, which requirements increase our costs. Because many of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us have been used for oil and natural gas production operations for many years, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of TENORM, particularly if TENORM requirements become more stringent over time.
