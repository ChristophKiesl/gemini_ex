Item 1.    BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
W. R. Grace & Co., through its subsidiaries, is engaged in the production and sale of specialty chemicals and specialty materials on a global basis through two reportable business segments: Grace Catalysts Technologies (“Catalysts Technologies”), which includes catalysts and related products and technologies used in petrochemical, refining, and other chemical manufacturing applications; and Grace Materials Technologies (“Materials Technologies”), which includes specialty materials, including silica-based and silica-alumina-based materials, used in pharma/consumer, coatings, and chemical process applications.
Historical Perspective
Grace is the successor to a company that began in 1854 and originally became a public company in 1953. We entered the specialty chemicals and specialty materials industries in 1954, the year in which we acquired the Davison Chemical Company. W. R. Grace & Co. is a Delaware corporation.
W. R. Grace & Co. conducts all of its business through a single wholly owned subsidiary, W. R. Grace & Co.–Conn. (“Grace–Conn.”), a Connecticut corporation formed in 1899. Grace–Conn. owns all of the assets, properties and rights of W. R. Grace & Co. on a consolidated basis, either directly or through subsidiaries.
Recent Developments
Acquisitions
We discuss our approach to Mergers and Acquisitions below, under “Profitable Growth Strategy.” In line with that strategy, in recent years we have completed the following transactions:
We completed the acquisition of the business and assets of Rive Technology, Inc. (“Rive”) on June 17, 2019, for $22.8 million, with an additional $2.0 million holdback payment remitted in the three months ended September 30, 2020. The business is included in the Refining Technologies operating segment of our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment. The acquisition included Rive’s MOLECULAR HIGHWAY® zeolite technology for catalytic processes, which allows us to offer a broader spectrum of products for converting crude oil to petrochemical feedstocks.
On April 3, 2018, we acquired the assets of the polyolefin catalysts business of Albemarle Corporation for $418.0 million, net of cash acquired and including customary post-closing adjustments. The acquisition included production plants in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Yeosu, South Korea; research and development and pilot plant capabilities; and an extensive portfolio of intellectual property. The business is included in the Specialty Catalysts operating segment of our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment. The acquisition was complementary to our existing Specialty Catalysts business and has strengthened our commercial relationships, catalysts technology portfolio, and manufacturing network.
On June 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the assets of the BASF Polyolefin Catalysts business for a purchase price of $250.6 million. The acquisition included technologies, patents, trademarks, and production plants in Pasadena, Texas, and Tarragona, Spain. The acquisition added the following technologies to our catalysts portfolio: (1) LYNX® high-activity polyethylene (“PE”) catalyst technologies used commercially in slurry processes for the production of high-density PE resins such as bimodal film and pipe; and (2) LYNX® polypropylene (“PP”) catalyst technologies used commercially in all major PP process technologies including slurry, bulk loop, stirred gas, fluid gas, and stirred bulk. The acquisition also provided us with significant additional flexibility and capacity for our global polyolefin catalysts manufacturing network. These products became part of the Specialty Catalysts operating segment of our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment.
We completed the acquisition of the assets of the Polypropylene Licensing and Catalysts business of The Dow Chemical Company on December 2, 2013, for a cash purchase price of $510.4 million (which included post-closing adjustments). The acquisition included UNIPOL® Polypropylene Process Technology as well as CONSISTA® and SHAC® catalysts. The technology and products complemented our polyolefin catalyst

businesses as part of the Specialty Catalysts operating segment of our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment. The acquisition also included our production plant in Norco, Louisiana.
Other Notable Developments
In 2016, Grace completed a separation transaction with respect to GCP Applied Technologies Inc., then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grace (“GCP”), which included Grace’s former Construction Products operating segment and the packaging technologies business of its Materials Technologies operating segment (the “Separation”). The Separation was effected by means of a pro rata distribution to the Company’s stockholders of all of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock. As a result of the transaction, GCP became an independent public company.
On February 3, 2014, Grace concluded a voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, when the joint plan of reorganization (the “Joint Plan”) filed by Grace and certain other parties became effective.
Global Scope

The Grace Value Model (“GVM”)
The Grace Value Model is our framework for creating and delivering value to customers, investors and employees. At the company level, we create value through our focused portfolio, strong strategic position, and disciplined capital allocation. At the business level, we create value through customer-driven innovation, commercial excellence, and operating excellence. Linking and enabling all of these elements are great talent, high-performance culture, and integrated business management processes. Our ability to rigorously execute the Grace Value Model is a principal source of our competitive advantage in the global marketplace and our financial performance. The Grace Value Model is illustrated as follows:
Human Capital Management
Our great talent and high-performance culture are the most important sources of our competitive advantage and long-term ability to deliver value to customers and investors. We have invested heavily in our global talent and talent management system, which includes aligned goal setting, ongoing feedback and coaching, effective performance reviews, and a continuous cycle of professional development. We have also invested significantly in talent development and effectiveness, including over $6 million and 50,000 hours of commercial excellence investment and training for our commercial teams since 2016. In 2019 and 2020, we refreshed more than 10% of our global workforce, including upgrading talent where needed and adding key leadership roles throughout the organization. Our voluntary workforce turnover rate was 5.4% in 2020.
Our high-performance culture is based on our commitment to performance and our five Grace Leadership Behaviors: Deliver Results; Think Critically; Be Authentic; Communicate; and Engage and Include. We expect our colleagues to model these behaviors and our values in their daily business conduct and include behavior as a core element of our performance reviews.
We aspire to continually strengthen our talent and high-performance culture by welcoming and valuing the unique backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, experiences, perspectives, and contributions of our employees around the globe. We have a well-developed Diversity and Inclusion strategy and a multi-year action plan to improve the diversity of our global team and ensure every employee feels included and valued.
Our diversity and inclusion strategy starts at the top: on the Grace Board of Directors, 29% of our independent directors are women, and on the Grace Leadership Team, 50% of our executives are women or people of color, including three of four business unit leaders. Increasing the diversity of our global team, including greater representation of women and under-represented minorities, is a focus. Through diversity and inclusion, we strengthen our people and our business.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our human capital management strategies and priorities in 2020. Aligned with our strong safety culture, we developed clear and effective worksite safety protocols, updated policies to add flexibility, and provided personal protective equipment to protect our essential employees working onsite in our manufacturing plants, research laboratories, and quality control laboratories. In addition, we paid for COVID-19 testing globally and covered treatment in the U.S. Approximately 45% of our workforce worked from home for most of 2020, following a seamless transition to remote work in March, including implementation of new communication and collaboration technology. We reduced operating costs during the year, 

TOC—Financial Statements

but were careful to protect our growth investments, maintain our focus on technology leadership, and continue our commercial excellence and operating excellence initiatives. We made no layoffs or salary reductions and continued employee development and hiring of critical talent. We experienced very high levels of engagement and productivity throughout the year.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 4,000 employees with 2,200 employed in the United States and 1,000 employed in Germany.
Approximately 2,300 employees are salaried, and 1,700 employees are hourly. Approximately 700 of our manufacturing employees at 5 manufacturing sites in the United States are represented by unions. We have operated without a labor work stoppage for more than 20 years. Outside the United States, we have works councils and unions serving approximately 1,400 employees, the majority of whom are located at our European sites.
Our Approach to Mergers & Acquisitions (“M&A”)
Our approach to M&A prioritizes strategic fit and financial returns. We seek investments that improve our technology, research and development and/or commercial capabilities; enhance and/or leverage our manufacturing capabilities; and include attractive growth and profitability opportunities. Our recent acquisitions have been very synergistic, with strong growth and returns driven by significant cost and capital synergies. We establish minimum return requirements for acquisitions, based on specific risk-adjusted hurdle rates, and expect all acquisitions to be accretive to earnings per share (“EPS”).

DAVICAT® catalysts and catalyst carriers extend Grace-wide material science expertise in silicas, aluminas, and zeolites into a number of petrochemicals and fine chemicals applications.
Refining Technologies
FCC Catalysts and Additives
We are a global leader in developing and manufacturing fluid catalytic cracking, or FCC, catalysts and additives that are designed to enable petroleum refiners to increase profits by improving product yields, value and quality. Our FCC products also enable refiners to reduce emissions from their FCC units and reduce sulfur content in the transportation fuels they produce. Oil refining is a highly specialized discipline, and FCC catalysts must be tailored to meet local variations in crude oil feedstocks and a refinery’s desired product mix. We work regularly with our customers to identify the most appropriate catalyst and additive formulations for their changing needs.
FCC units are designed to produce a broad spectrum of refined product yields, including gasoline, middle distillates, and liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG. Traditionally, many FCC operators have focused on maximizing yields of transportation fuels. However, as demand for petrochemicals increases, a growing segment of refiners have transitioned their FCC operations with the primary objective of maximizing yields of petrochemical feedstocks, such as propylene. We maintain multiple industry leading technologies, including ZAVANTI™ and VIP-R™, that allow our customers to capture unique value from petrochemical feedstock driven operations.
Many countries and regions, including the U.S., European Union, Japan, Russia, India and China have imposed regulatory limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel. We have developed a portfolio of products designed to assist refiners in meeting their gasoline sulfur-reduction targets, including our D-PRISM® and GSR® additives and our SURCA® catalyst family.
Also, many U.S. petroleum refiners have entered into consent decrees with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) under which the refiners have agreed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The European Union has also imposed requirements on refineries with respect to nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides emissions. Our additives are designed to assist refineries in meeting their obligations to reduce these pollutants. Our Super DESOX® additive reduces sulfur oxides emissions from commercial FCC units. Our DENOX® additives are designed to achieve reductions in nitrogen oxides emissions comparable to those obtained from capital intensive alternatives available to a refinery, while our non-platinum-based combustion promoter CP® P is designed to enable refiners to control carbon monoxide emissions without increasing nitrogen oxides. Our newly developed OXYBURN® additives are used in the reduction of oxygenates which are often a problem when co-processing renewable feedstocks in FCC units.

TOC—Financial Statements

Hydroprocessing Catalysts
We market most of our hydroprocessing catalysts through our Advanced Refining Technologies LLC (“ART”) joint venture with Chevron Products Company (“Chevron”). We hold a 50% economic interest in ART, which is not consolidated in our financial statements so ART’s sales are excluded from our sales. We established ART to combine our technology with that of Chevron and to develop, market, and sell hydroprocessing catalysts to customers in the petroleum refining industry worldwide.
We are a leading supplier of hydroprocessing catalysts designed for processing high resid content feedstocks. We offer products for fixed-bed resid hydrotreating, on-stream catalyst replacement, and ebullating-bed resid hydrocracking processes.
We also offer a full line of catalysts, customized for individual refiners, used in distillate hydrotreating to produce ultra-low sulfur content gasoline and diesel fuel, including our SmART CATALYST SYSTEM® and APART® Catalyst Systems. As discussed above, regulatory limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel are becoming more common. These products are designed to help refiners to reduce the sulfur content of their products.
Our ENRICH® catalysts, which are marketed by Grace rather than ART, enable the coprocessing of bio-based feedstocks at refineries.
We have rights to sell hydrocracking and lubes hydroprocessing catalysts to licensees of Chevron Lummus Global (“CLG”) and other petroleum refiners for unit refills. These rights allow us to streamline hydroprocessing catalyst supply and improve technical service for refining customers by establishing ART as their single point of contact for all their hydroprocessing catalyst needs.
Manufacturing, Marketing and Raw Materials
Our Catalysts Technologies products are manufactured by a network of globally coordinated plants. Our integrated supply chain organization is responsible for the effective utilization of our manufacturing capabilities. For a discussion of our manufacturing plants for Catalysts Technologies, see Item 2, “Properties,” below.
We use a global organization of direct sales professionals to market our polyolefin catalysts, polypropylene process technology, and chemical catalysts, that seeks to maintain close working relationships with our customers. Our global direct sales force is complemented by a network of distributors and agents in Asia Pacific and, to a lesser extent, the Americas and Middle East. These relationships enable us to cooperate with major polymer and chemical producers to develop catalyst technologies that complement their process or application developments. We have geographically distributed our sales and technical service professionals to make them responsive to the needs of our geographically diverse customers. We typically operate under long-term contracts with our customers.
We use a global organization of technical professionals, including a direct sales force, with extensive experience in refining processes, catalyst development, and catalyst applications to market our refining catalysts and additives. These professionals work to tailor our technology to the needs of each specific customer. We generally negotiate prices for our refining catalysts because our formulations are specific to the needs of each customer and each customer receives individual attention and technical service. We sell a significant portion of our hydroprocessing catalysts through multiple-year supply agreements with our geographically diverse customer base.
The principal raw materials for Catalysts Technologies products include molybdenum oxide, specialty inorganics, caustic soda, alumina and derivatives, sodium silicate, nickel, rare earths, solvents, and titanium tetrachloride. Multiple suppliers are generally available for each of these materials; however, some of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We seek to mitigate the risk of using single source suppliers by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers or, for unique materials, by using alternative formulations from other suppliers. In some instances, we produce our own raw materials and intermediates.
Prices for many of our raw materials, including metals, and energy can be volatile. In response to increases in raw materials and energy costs, we generally take actions to mitigate the effects of higher costs including developing alternative formulations for our products, increasing productivity, hedging purchases of certain raw materials, and increasing prices.

TOC—Financial Statements

As in many chemical businesses, we consume significant quantities of natural gas in the production of Catalysts Technologies products. World events and other economic factors cause volatility in the price of natural gas. Increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas and raw materials can have a significant impact on our operating margins. We have implemented a risk management program under which we hedge natural gas in a way that is designed to mitigate the effects of price volatility.
Seasonality
Seasonality does not have a significant overall effect on our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment. However, under traditional patterns, sales of FCC catalysts have tended to be lower in the first calendar quarter due to maintenance outages taken prior to the shift in production by refineries from home heating oil for the winter season to gasoline production for the summer season. FCC catalysts and ebullating-bed hydroprocessing catalysts are consumed at a relatively steady rate and are replaced regularly. Fixed-bed hydroprocessing catalysts are consumed over a period of years and are replaced in bulk in an irregular pattern. Since our customers periodically shut down their refining processes to replace fixed-bed hydroprocessing catalysts in bulk, our hydroprocessing catalyst sales to any customer can vary substantially over the course of a year and between years based on that customer’s catalyst replacement schedule.
Backlog of Orders; Working Capital
While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, this backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales for Catalysts Technologies, nor are the changes, from time to time, significant. Our working capital consists of inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and deferred revenue. We closely manage these working capital accounts. We value inventory balances under the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories have turned regularly, but balances typically increase during the first half of the year before declining as a result of increased sales in the second half. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are also affected by this business cycle, typically requiring us to have greater working capital needs during the second and third quarters.
Competition
Competition in the polyolefin catalyst, catalyst supports, and polypropylene process licensing industry is technology-intensive. Our competition in this industry includes Univation, LyondellBasell, PQ, and Lummus Novolen Technology. Most competitors sell their products and/or license their technology worldwide.
Competition in FCC catalysts and additives and hydroprocessing catalysts is based on value delivered to refiners, which is based on differentiated technology, catalyst performance, technical and customer service, and price. Our principal global FCC catalyst competitors are Albemarle, BASF, and SINOPEC. Our principal global competitors in FCC additives are Johnson Matthey, Albemarle, and BASF. Our principal global competitors in hydroprocessing catalysts are Shell Catalysts (formerly Criterion), Albemarle, Haldor Topsoe, UOP, and Axens. We also have multiple regional competitors.
GRACE MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES
Materials Technologies uses our significant specialty silica, zeolite and fine chemical knowledge and applications expertise to design and manufacture products to create significant value for our customers. Our customers include pharmaceutical companies, consumer products manufacturers, coatings manufacturers, emission control system manufacturers, petrochemical and natural gas processors, and plastics manufacturers. We believe that our technological expertise and broad technology platform provide a competitive advantage, allowing us to tailor our products to specific customer requirements and help them create value in their operations and end markets.

While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, this backlog is not material in respect to our total annual sales for Materials Technologies, nor are the changes, from time to time, significant. Our working capital consists of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. We closely manage these working capital accounts. We value inventory balances under the FIFO method. Inventories have turned regularly.
Competition
There are many manufacturers of engineered materials that market their products on a global basis including Evonik, PQ, and Nalco. Competition is generally based on product performance, technical service, quality and reliability, price, and other differentiated product features to address the needs of customers, end-users, and brand owners. Our products compete on the basis of distinct technology, product quality, and customer support. Competition for these products is highly fragmented, with a large number of companies that sell their products on a global or regional basis.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
Competition in the specialty chemicals and specialty materials industry is often based on technological superiority and innovation. Our ability to maintain our margins and effectively compete with other suppliers depends on our ability to introduce new products based on innovative technology, as well as our ability to obtain patent or other intellectual property protection. Our research and development programs emphasize development of new products and processes, improvement of existing products and processes, and application of existing products and processes to new industries and uses. We conduct most of our research activity in North America and Europe.
We file patents in order to protect our investments in innovation arising from research and product development in all our businesses, and as a result, numerous patents and patent applications protect our products, formulations, manufacturing processes, equipment, and improvements. For example, we selectively file and obtain patents in our Refining Technologies business, as well as in our chemical catalysts product line in our Specialty Catalysts business, for strategic new products or for significant business opportunities. We routinely file and obtain patents in a number of countries around the world that are significant to our polyolefin catalysts product line in our Specialty Catalysts business.
In our Materials Technologies business, we focus our research on the development and use of specialty materials products and formulations for diverse applications. We file patents and trademarks in various countries to protect our unique products, processes and expertise in strategic areas of our business, and to cover key product innovations in adjacent market segments.
We also benefit from the use of trade secret information, including know-how and other proprietary information relating to many of our products and processing technologies in all of our businesses, including, but not limited to, our business in licensing UNIPOL® Polypropylene Process Technology.
While we seek legal protection for our innovations, there can be no assurance, however, that our patents, patent applications and precautions to protect trade secrets and know-how will provide sufficient protection for our intellectual property. In addition, other companies may independently develop technology that could replicate, and thus diminish the advantage provided by, our trade secrets. Other companies may also develop alternative technology or design-arounds that could circumvent our patents or may acquire patent rights applicable to our business which might interpose a limitation on expansion of our business in the future.
ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, SAFETY, AND SECURITY (or “EHSS”) MATTERS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
We are subject, along with other manufacturers of specialty chemicals, to stringent regulations under numerous regional, national, provincial, state and local EHSS laws and regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, handling, transportation, disposal and stewardship of chemicals and other materials. In addition to those laws and regulations, as we operate and/or sell to customers in over 60 countries, we must comply with important government regulations around the globe with respect to wide-ranging matters, including business and operating 

TOC—Financial Statements

licenses, reporting requirements, registrations of intellectual property rights, human capital management, mine safety, and customs and taxes, among others. Cumulatively, the expenses of compliance with government regulations have a material effect on our earnings; however, as other manufacturers of specialty chemicals face similar regulations (provided they operate under similar regulatory frameworks), we do not see our compliance as creating a material competitive disadvantage to date, and our conscientious adherence to safety and other regulations has positive effects on our overall position as a global company. Nevertheless, changes in, or additions to, governmental regulations may lead to additional expenditures and negative effects on our operations.
Environmental laws require that certain responsible parties, as defined in the relevant statute, fund remediation actions regardless of legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. We are involved in various response actions to address the presence of chemical substances as required by applicable laws. 
We have expended substantial funds to comply with environmental laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so in the future. The following table sets forth our expenditures in the past three years, and our estimated expenditures in 2021 and 2022, for (i) the operation and maintenance of manufacturing facilities and the disposal of wastes; (ii) capital expenditures for environmental control facilities; and (iii) site remediation:

(1)Amounts are based on environmental response matters for which sufficient information is available to estimate costs. We do not have sufficient information to estimate all of our possible future environmental response costs. As we receive new information, our estimate of such costs may change materially.
The table above does not include estimated expenditures related to the replacement of the dam spillway on the Libby, Montana, mine site. We are legally obligated to operate the dam and construct a new spillway in accordance with the conditions of the latest permit issued by the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. We have estimated the total cost of the project to be $95.0 million, with the timing of disbursements subject to a number of variables. Construction will begin in 2021 and is expected to take three to four years. Additional information about this matter and our environmental remediation activities is provided in this Report in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under Note 10, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
EHSS Programs
We continuously seek to improve our environmental, health, safety, and security performance. To the extent applicable, we extend the basic elements of the American Chemistry Council’s RESPONSIBLE CARE® program to all our locations worldwide. Our Environment, Health, Safety, and Security Policy and RESPONSIBLE CARE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM® guide the company, our operating segments, and our facilities worldwide in systematically managing the environmental, health, safety, process safety, product safety, security, and sustainability aspects of our operations.
Sustainability
Overview
We succeed when we deliver value to our customers, and that success is increasingly based on how we help them meet their sustainability goals. Many of our products and technical services improve the efficiency of our customers’ products and processes, reduce energy or water use, cut harmful emissions, conserve material inputs, and/or reduce waste. Several of our technologies enable our customers to make products that meet the toughest environmental standards or to reformulate products to address rising consumer and regulatory expectations for sustainability, human health, and safety. As a leading manufacturer of process catalysts, we have become an active participant in the circular economy, with increasing business in assisting our customers with the recycling or

reprocessing of spent catalysts. As part of our commitment to RESPONSIBLE CARE®, we systematically track safety and environmental performance through a comprehensive, global EHSS management system covering the environmental, health, safety (including process safety and product safety) and security aspects of our operations, and track progress through pertinent metrics.
In 2019, we began reporting to the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”). This year, we made our CDP Climate and CDP Water disclosures public for the first time. We also published sustainability disclosures aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standard for the chemical industry. In addition, we strengthened the governance of our sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) related activities by naming a Chief Sustainability Officer (“CSO”) reporting directly to the CEO, and established a Sustainability Leadership Council composed of the CSO and leadership from Grace businesses and integrated supply chain. We also established targets to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 22% from a baseline of 2019 by 2029, as well as 10-year reduction targets for water consumption and waste generation.
Product Portfolio
As part of a strategic review of our product portfolio, in 2019 we identified the products that directly contribute to our customers’ sustainability objectives, including:
•Products designed for use-phase efficiency — defined by the SASB as products that “through their use—can be shown to improve energy efficiency, eliminate or lower GHG emissions, reduce raw materials consumption, increase product longevity, and/or reduce water consumption,” either through:
◦Improved products — by increasing the efficiency of a product during its use phase, or
◦Improved processes — by increasing the efficiency of the manufacturing processes used to make products;
•Meeting the strictest environmental standards — products that directly enable customers to meet environmental regulatory/legal requirements applicable to their products or manufacturing processes; and
•Cleaner, safer products to meet consumer demands — products that enable customers to reformulate their products to avoid or reduce to de minimis levels substances of concern to their customers.
This year, we reviewed the requested disclosures from SASB and CDP as well as other ESG ratings organizations and expanded our product categories to include products that make a significant contribution to the move toward a more circular economy through:
•Enabling material recycling and bio-feeds – products that are tailored to enable customers to replace petroleum inputs with bio-based and recycled materials, and FCC catalyst sales (not counted above) where we take back spent FCC catalyst for recycling, or otherwise enable the reuse or recycling of spent catalysts.
Together, the products in our portfolio, including those of our ART joint venture, that address these sustainability endpoints accounted for approximately $1.1 billion, or 49% of our total revenue in 2020. Looking to the future, we estimate that 62% of our R&D projects are linked to at least one of these customer sustainability objectives. We expect to see further opportunities as we continue to develop technologies for advanced plastics recycling and renewable fuels.
ESG Rankings
For 2020, we again earned a Gold Rating from EcoVadis, this year placing us in the 95th percentile of all companies ranked by EcoVadis on their sustainability performance. EcoVadis is a leading third-party entity that evaluates suppliers on a complex scale of sustainability and ESG factors. CDP increased our 2020 Climate Disclosure score to a B-, above the average achieved by our chemical industry peers and above the North American average. Also in 2020, the ESG Risk Rating† from Sustainalytics placed us in the top quintile of both chemical and specialty companies. †Source Sustainalytics.
