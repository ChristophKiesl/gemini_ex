Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are well positioned to successfully execute our operational strategy and achieve our primary business objectives to provide capital appreciation and increase our return to stockholders over time because of the following competitive strengths:

• | Differentiated frac sand supply and logistics services. We provide integrated, mine-to-wellsite frac sand supply and logistics services to customers with an emphasis on safety, surety and efficiency. By controlling all points along the supply chain, we are able to better control quality and consistency of product, reduce delivery costs to our customers and realize supply chain efficiencies, resulting in more efficient and productive wellsite operations for our customers. We believe our offerings are unique in their ability to provide customers with wellsite-specific solutions for proppant supply, delivery and management due to our control of our production facilities, multiple in-basin rail terminals, both silo- and container-based last mile equipment solutions, integrated software platforms and wellsite management solutions. This enables us to augment customers’ fragmented sand supply chains with a simplified infrastructure for purchasing and related administrative matters, while utilizing adaptive technologies and best practices, including jobsite and operational safety. 


• | Long-term customer relationships. In conjunction with, and fully-supportive of, our integrated and differentiated frac sand and logistics service offering, we have developed and continue to expand our relationships with customers, particularly exploration and production companies ("E&Ps"). For the year ended December 31, 2019, 66% of our total sales volumes were to E&Ps. These E&P relationships are built and strengthened through realization of mutual benefits that accrue to both our customers and us. These include more integrated near- and long-term supply/demand planning, decreased volatility and disruption in sand and services demand, better visibility for us and our customers, surety of supply for our customers, consistent demand for our products and services, and greater emphasis on long-term cost savings versus near-term price fluctuations. These relationships are also supported by long-term contractual agreements. As of January 1, 2020, our long-term contracts have an average remaining contractual term of 1.7 years. A substantial portion of our logistics services are provided to customers with whom we have long-term agreements as defined in a master services agreements ("MSA") and related work orders. We expect to continue selling a majority of our sand and services to our customers with long-term contracts and MSAs in 2020 and future years. We believe the fully integrated service model combining sand and last mile logistics creates lasting relationships with our customers who value reliability of supply and cost effective delivery to the wellsite. 


• | Focus on the customer. Our business model places the utmost importance on serving the customer, meeting their needs for reliable and safe delivery of sand into the blender at the wellsite, while focusing on optimizing and reducing the overall delivered cost of sand. Our logistics and wellsite operations utilize purpose built equipment, minimizing operating costs at the wellsite, while also providing the flexibility our customers demand for both silo- and container-based delivery solutions. Our PropDispatch software provides customized dashboards for each customer to see their data in real-time and make decisions as needed. The logistics and wellsite operations are supported by our distribution network. This owned and operated network, in conjunction with third-party terminals, allows us to better, and cost effectively, service our customers’ short-notice needs across basins, and provide our customers with reliable supply and solutions for the logistical challenges presented by the large volume of frac sand typically required for each well completion. The strategic location, low per-unit production cost and logistics capabilities of our portfolio of production facilities enable us to serve all major U.S. and Canadian oil and natural gas producing basins. 


• | Experienced and incentivized management team. Our management team has extensive experience operating in the oil and natural gas industry. We benefit from long-term relationships with participants in the exploration and production and oilfield services industries. Our strong operational and commercial understanding of the markets in which our customers operate, together with expertise in development, construction and operation of frac sand processing and terminal facilities, bulk solids material handling, frac sand supply chain management, equipment design, rail and truck logistics provide distinct competitive strength to Hi-Crush. Our management team is focused on optimizing our current business and expanding our operations through disciplined execution of our operational strategy. Our management team is well-aligned with the interests of stockholders through their combined 5% direct ownership interest in our common stock, whose value is directly impacted by prudent growth in profitability, cash flows and the overall success of the business. 

Business Strategies 
Our primary business objectives are to provide capital appreciation and increase our return to stockholders over time. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:

• | Providing sand as a service. As we meet our customers' varied and evolving needs, we focus on the management of frac sand for our customers through "sand as a service." Through the development and deployment of a fully-integrated suite of sand and logistics solutions, including production, transportation, wellsite management and technology integration, we leverage our capabilities to manage our customers' frac sand and logistics needs all the way from the mine to the blender at the wellsite. Our relentless focus on execution of our operations aligns our service with their needs for quality and reliability as we handle the frac sand production, transportation and management challenges faced every day, while also placing a priority on safety. 


• | Focusing on long-term relationships with key customers. A key component of our business model is our integrated service model of providing sand and last mile services directly to the end user, particularly the larger E&Ps. Another component has been our sales strategy, which seeks to secure a high percentage of our volumes under long-term contracts with oil and natural gas E&Ps and major pressure pumping service providers. We believe this provides a more stable base of cash flow, while also providing the flexibility that we and our customers desire in the event of market changes. We believe this business model serves as the foundation for our ability to serve our customers, while reliably providing the product that is a critical component to the well completion process. We intend to utilize a substantial majority of our processing capacity to fulfill our customer contracts and continue to serve our existing and new customers with frac sand delivered through our distribution network and to the blender at the wellsite. 


• | Capitalizing on compelling industry fundamentals. We intend to continue positioning ourselves as a premier provider of proppant and logistics solutions to the North American energy industry, as we believe the proppant and logistics market offers attractive growth fundamentals over the long-term. The innovations in horizontal drilling in the various North American shale basins and other unconventional oil and natural gas plays have resulted in greater demand for frac sand per well and per stage. The long-term growth in frac sand demand and related logistics services is underpinned by continued horizontal drilling, increasing frac sand use per well and cost advantages over other proppant types, including resin-coated sand and ceramics. 


• | Building on our position as a low cost provider. We seek to maintain and improve upon our position as a low cost provider of frac sand. We will continue to analyze and pursue organic expansion efforts that will similarly allow us to capitalize on and cost-effectively optimize our existing production and logistics assets. For example, in 2019 we completed the acquisition of Proppant Logistics, which owns Pronghorn, a provider of end-to-end proppant logistics services, expanding our logistics and wellsite operations into additional major U.S. oil and gas basins. Further, we seek to find ways to reduce our customers' cost of frac sand delivered to the blender at the wellsite regardless of the source of production. We intend to accomplish this through a combination of our low cost production, our network of owned and operated terminals or third-party operated sites, our geographic footprint, and our logistics and wellsite operations. We intend to continue to analyze and pursue opportunities to cost-effectively expand our geographic reach, optimize our existing assets and meet our customers' demand for our high quality frac sand. 


• | Pursuing accretive acquisitions. In March 2017, we acquired a 1,226-acre frac sand reserve, located near Kermit, Texas. In August 2018, we acquired FB Industries Inc. ("FB Industries"), a company engaged in the engineering, design and marketing of silo-based frac sand management systems. In January 2019, the Company acquired BulkTracer, the owner of a logistics software system, PropDispatch, and in May 2019, we completed the acquisition of Proppant Logistics. As we evaluate acquisition opportunities, we intend to remain focused on operations that complement our reserves of frac sand, our portfolio of efficient production facilities, and assets that provide or would accommodate the development and construction of advantaged logistics and distribution capabilities. We believe these factors are critical to our business model and are important characteristics for any potential acquisitions. 


• | Maintaining financial flexibility and ample liquidity. We continue to pursue a disciplined financial policy and maintain liquidity aligned with our future financing needs and debt maturities. As of February 14, 2020, we had cash of $20.1 million and our senior secured revolving credit facility (the "ABL Credit Facility") had $43.9 million pursuant to available borrowings ($64.9 million, net of $21.0 million letter of credit commitments), resulting in total liquidity of $64.0 million. The ABL Credit Facility is available to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, including the making of certain restricted payments permitted therein. Borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets. On August 1, 2018, the Company completed the private placement of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 9.50% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the "Senior Notes"). We believe that our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets provides us with the financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic expansion and acquisition strategy. 

Our Industry 
The oil and natural gas proppant industry is comprised of businesses involved in the delivery, mining and manufacturing of the propping agents used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is the most widely used method for stimulating increased production from wells. The process consists of pumping fluids, mixed with granular proppants, into the geologic formation at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the hydrocarbon-bearing rock. Proppant-filled fractures create conductive channels through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation into the wellbore and then to the surface.
Industry Data
The market and industry data included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K was obtained through our own internal analysis and research, coupled with industry publications, surveys, reports and other analysis conducted by third parties. Industry publications, surveys, reports and other analysis generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. Although we believe that the industry reports are generally reliable, we have not independently verified the industry data from third-party sources. Although we believe our internal analysis and research is reliable and appropriate, such internal analysis and research has not been verified by any independent source.
Types of Proppant
There are three primary types of proppant that are commonly utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: raw frac sand, resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramic beads. We are engaged exclusively in the production of raw frac sand.
Raw Frac Sand
Of the three primary types of proppant, raw frac sand is the most widely used due to its broad applicability in oil and natural gas wells and its cost advantage relative to other proppants. Raw frac sand has been employed in nearly all major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins.
Raw frac sand is generally mined from the surface or underground, and in some cases crushed, and then cleaned, dried and sorted into consistent mesh sizes. The American Petroleum Institute ("API") has a range of guidelines it uses to evaluate frac sand grades and mesh sizes. In order to meet API specifications, frac sand must meet certain thresholds related to crush strength (ability to withstand high pressures), roundness and sphericity (facilitates hydrocarbon flow, or conductivity), particle size distribution, turbidity (low levels of contaminants), acid solubility and percent quartz (mineralogy). Oil and natural gas producers generally require that frac sand used in their drilling and completion processes meet API specifications.
Raw frac sand can be further delineated into three main types: Northern White, Brady Brown and what is commonly referred to as "in-basin" frac sand. The term "Northern White" is a commonly-used designation for premium white sand produced in Wisconsin and other limited parts of the upper Midwest region of the United States. Northern White, which is the type of frac sand we produce at our Wisconsin facilities, is known for its high crush strength, low turbidity, roundness and sphericity and monocrystalline grain structure. Northern White frac sand has historically commanded premium prices relative to Brady Brown. Brady Brown, or regional sand, had been preferred due to its proximity to the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale plays, and, therefore, its lower cost due to reduced logistics costs compared to Northern White frac sand. in-basin frac sand began to be developed and produced in 2017 in the Permian Basin and is also being developed and produced in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Mid-Con basins and has been adopted quickly due to its proximity to wellsites and reduced logistics costs. We produce Northern White and in-basin frac sand at our production facilities. 
Resin-Coated Frac Sand
Resin-coated frac sand consists of raw frac sand that is coated with a flexible resin that increases the sand’s crush strength and prevents crushed sand from dispersing throughout the fracture. Precured (or tempered) resin-coated sand primarily enhances crush strength, thermal stability and chemical resistance, allowing the sand to perform under harsh downhole conditions. Curable (or bonding) resin-coated frac sand uses a resin that is designed to bond together under closure stress and high temperatures, preventing proppant flowback. We do not produce resin-coated frac sand, but from time to time, we may purchase or transload resin-coated frac sand for use by our customers. 
Ceramics
Ceramic proppant is a manufactured product of comparatively consistent size and spherical shape that typically offers the highest crush strength relative to other types of proppants. Ceramic proppant derives its product strength from the molecular structure of its underlying raw material and is designed to withstand extreme heat, depth and pressure environments. We do not produce ceramic proppant, but from time to time, we may purchase or transload ceramic proppant for use by our customers. 
Proppant Mesh Sizes
Mesh size is used to describe the size of the proppant and is determined by sieving the proppant through screens with uniform openings corresponding to the desired size of the proppant. Each type of proppant comes in various sizes, categorized as mesh sizes, and the various mesh sizes are used in different applications in the oil and natural gas industry. The mesh number system is a measure of the number of equally sized openings per square inch of screen through which the proppant is sieved. For example, a 40 mesh screen has 40 equally sized openings per linear inch. Therefore, as the mesh number increases, the granule size decreases. In order to meet API specifications, 90% of the proppant described as 40/70 mesh size proppant must consist of granules that will pass through a 40 mesh screen but not through a 70 mesh screen. We excavate various mesh sizes at our facilities, and sell 20/40, 30/50, 40/70 and 100 mesh frac sand used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
Demand Trends
Demand for frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as overall industry activity. 
Demand fundamentals are expected to improve in 2020 compared to the latter part of 2019, particularly as some of the factors limiting demand in the back half of 2019, including E&P capex budget exhaustion, are alleviated. Additionally, an increase in the number of drilled but uncompleted wells represents pent up demand for completion services and frac sand that will provide further support for overall demand in 2020 and beyond, regardless of rig count activity. As E&Ps adjust annual spending cadence to adhere to the call from investors for capital discipline, demand for frac sand and logistics services may see greater stabilization throughout the year as opposed to the cyclical trend seen in 2018 and 2019. Demand for logistics services associated with frac sand has been directly correlated with the demand for frac sand, and is expected to grow throughout the first half of 2020. The increase in demand for frac sand logistics is expected to expand further driven by major E&P customers increasing adoption of an integrated frac sand supply and logistics sourcing strategy.
Supply Trends 
In 2017 and 2018, the industry developed additional frac sand production capacity, with the majority of this development in the Permian Basin, as well as mines in the Eagle Ford and other basins, to meet growing demand for lower cost in-basin supply. As a result of the rapid expansion of capacity, frac sand supply currently exceeds demand, however, we believe that supply and demand will be in balance over time as demand continues to grow and higher cost production is idled or permanently shut down over the coming years. While stated frac sand capacity may exceed near-term demand, available industry capacity is constrained due to several factors, including availability of the grades of frac sand that are most in demand in certain regions or well completion environments, general operating conditions and normal downtime, and logistics constraints.
The advent of in-basin sand supply available closer to the wellsite has resulted in a rapid shift away from Northern White sand supply to in-basin sand supply since 2017, specifically to finer mesh sizes of sand, particularly 100 mesh which is the principal grade produced in-basin. With the general trend towards use of finer mesh sizes of sand in all basins, Northern White fine mesh supply is increasingly logistically challenged and coarse grade sand supply greatly exceeds demand. Over time, we believe frac sand facilities producing Northern White at a higher cost are likely to be idled or permanently shut down due to increased competition within these regions resulting in realized sales pricing below the level at which such facilities can profitably operate. At this time, we are unable to determine which facilities will be idled or shut down, or the exact timeframe in which such actions might be taken.
The onset of reduced completion activity beginning in the third quarter of 2018 has caused frac sand demand growth to lag the increase in supply, and has resulted in a significant reduction in pricing, particularly for Northern White sand, that is impacting sand pricing in all basins. These factors continued to impact the market throughout 2019, particularly as E&Ps have been more conscious of managing spending over the course of the year. This has led to a steady decline in market pricing from the second half of 2018 into 2019, slowing in the second half of 2019. In response to the price decline, we and many of our competitors have reduced available capacity through the temporary idling of facilities. In September 2018, the Company temporarily idled dry plant operations at the Whitehall facility and resumed production in January 2019. Beginning in August 2019, the Company reduced the hours of operations at the Whitehall facility. Our Augusta facility was idled in January 2019.
Logistics services are provided in various combinations of service components including railcar fleet management, truck dispatching and dedicated wellsite operation.  Supply of last mile logistics services broadly fall in the categories of traditional pneumatic trucking operations, silo systems supported by belly dump trucking operations and container solutions.  There are a number of small and large competitors in the three broad categories with new technologies being developed and tested.  We believe a differentiating factor among the various competitors will be the reliability of the service and the execution on a day-to-day basis and, over time, we expect consolidation of the service offerings in the industry.
Pricing 
Frac sand pricing has been volatile, rising from the latter half of 2016 through the first half of 2018. During the latter half of 2018, frac sand pricing reversed trend and rapidly declined due to the combined impact of increasing supplies of in-basin sand and reduced completions activity. Spot pricing continued to fall during 2019, as oversupply of frac sand, particularly in the Permian Basin, persisted. We believe pricing could improve during 2020, as higher cost production facilities curtail production or opt to idle or shut down operations.
There are numerous grades and sizes of proppant which sell at various prices, dependent primarily upon the delivery point, and also quality, grade of proppant and many other factors.  Pricing of proppant sold at the terminal is higher than pricing of proppant sold FOB plant as a result of the associated transportation and handling costs to bring the sand from the mine to the terminal. No reliable publicized pricing information for raw frac sand exists. However, it is believed that the overall pricing trends tend to be consistent across the various sizes and within regions with some variation due to transportation costs, resulting from distance from the source. We believe a significant amount of proppant is sold under long-term contracts with varying pricing mechanisms, with the remainder being sold under short-term pricing arrangements or the spot market.
Pricing for logistics services is generally based on a fixed component for labor and equipment and a variable component based on transportation costs.  Pricing for logistics services has been less volatile than proppant pricing over the past few years, but is becoming more competitive given the increasing number of companies and technologies offering certain services or combinations thereof. However, we believe that as major E&Ps expand their share of activity in the North American shale industry, the associated move to more efficient, factory style completions will drive emphasis on efficiency, safety, flexibility and service quality versus strict price competition. 
Customers and Contracts
Our current customer base includes major oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and pressure pumping service providers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Chevron USA Inc. ("Chevron"), Chesapeake Operating, LLC and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation each accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to each of Chevron and Halliburton Company ("Halliburton") accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to each of Halliburton and Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. 
A substantial portion of our frac sand is sold to customers with whom we have long-term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated 72% of our revenues from sales of frac sand to customers with whom we had long-term contracts. We expect to continue selling a majority of our sand to our customers with long-term contracts in 2020 and future years. As of January 1, 2020, our long-term contracts have an average remaining contractual term of 1.7 years with remaining terms ranging from 3 to 60 months. 
Our contracts define, among other commitments, the volume of product that the Company must provide and the volume that the customer must purchase by the end of the defined periods. Pricing structures under our agreements are in many cases subject to certain contractual adjustments and consist of a combination of negotiated pricing and fixed pricing. These arrangements may undergo negotiations regarding pricing and volume requirements, which may occur in volatile market conditions. We also sell sand on the spot market, at prices and other terms determined by the existing market conditions as well as the specific requirements of the customer. 
A substantial portion of our logistics services are provided to customers with whom we have long-term agreements as defined in a MSA and related work orders.  The MSA typically outlines the general terms and conditions for work performed by us relating to invoicing, insurance, indemnity, taxes and similar terms.  The work orders typically define the commercial terms including the type of equipment and services to be provided, with pricing that is generally determined on a job-by-job basis due the variability in the specific requirements of each wellsite.  
We may, from time to time, sell silo systems and related equipment to third parties at negotiated prices for the specific equipment.
Suppliers 
Although the majority of the frac sand that we sell is produced from our production facilities, we can purchase, and have purchased in the past, a certain amount of frac sand and other proppant from various third parties for sale to our customers. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company purchased 226,528, 267,628 and 142,019 tons, respectively, from third parties.  
Our Operations 
Frac Sand Excavation Operations
Raw frac sand is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined and processed. While the specific extraction method utilized depends primarily on the geologic setting, most raw frac sand is mined using conventional open-pit bench extraction methods. The composition, depth and chemical purity of the sand also dictate the processing method and equipment utilized. For example, broken rock from a sandstone deposit may require one, two or three stages of crushing to produce sand grains required to meet API specifications. In contrast, unconsolidated deposits (loosely bound sediments of sand), like those found at our Wyeville and Kermit facilities, may require little or no crushing during the excavation process. 
The surface excavation operations at our production facilities are conducted by a third-party contractor. The mining technique at our production facilities is open-pit excavation of approximately 20-acre panels of unconsolidated silica deposits. At our Kermit facilities, unconsolidated dune sand is mined through the excavation process. At our Augusta, Blair and Whitehall facilities, the excavation process involves clearing vegetation and trees overlying the proposed mining area. Additionally, limited blasting procedures are conducted at our Augusta, Blair and Whitehall facilities. The initial two to five feet of overburden is removed and utilized to construct perimeter berms around the pit and property boundary. No underground mines are operated at our production facilities.
A track excavator and articulated trucks are utilized for excavating the sand at several different elevation levels of the active pit. The pit is generally dry mined and mined material is loaded and hauled from different areas of the pit and different elevations within the pit to the primary loading facility at our mines' on-site wet processing facilities. We pay a fixed fee per ton of sand excavated, subject to a diesel fuel surcharge.
At our Wyeville facility, in addition to surface excavation, sand is also mined through dredging operations.  Silica deposits are extracted from the ground with water.  The resulting slurry is transported via pipeline to the wet processing facility. Similar to surface excavation operations, the dredging at our Wyeville facility is performed by a third-party contractor.
Processing Facilities 
Our processing facilities are designed to wash, sort, dry and store our raw frac sand, with each plant employing modern and efficient wet and dry processing technology.
Our mined raw frac sand is initially stockpiled before processing. The material is recovered by a mounted belt feeder, which extends beneath a surge pile and is fed onto a conveyor. The sand exits the tunnel on the conveyor belt and is fed into the wet plant where impurities, such as clay and organic particles, and unusable fine grain sand are removed from the raw feed. The wet processed sand is then stockpiled in advance of being fed into the dry plant for further processing. The Wisconsin wet plants operate for seven to eight months per year due to the limitations arising from sustained freezing temperatures during winter months. When in operation, our Wisconsin wet plants process more sand per day than the dry plants can process to build up stockpiles of frac sand that will be processed by the dry plants during the winter months. The Kermit wet plants operate year round and therefore the stockpiles of frac sand are processed by the dry plants in a shorter timeframe.
The wet processed sand stockpile is fed into the dry plant hopper using a front end loader. The material is processed in a natural gas fired vibratory fluid bed dryer contained in an enclosed building. After drying, the sand is screened through gyratory screens and separated into industry standard product sizes. The finished product is then conveyed to multiple on-site storage silos for each size specification and our railcar or truck loads are tested to ensure that the delivery meets API specifications. 
Logistics Capabilities 
Most frac sand is shipped in bulk from the processing facility to terminal facilities, or directly to the customers by truck, rail or barge. For bulk raw frac sand, transportation costs often represent a significant portion of the customer’s overall product cost. Consequently, shipping in large quantities, particularly by unit train when shipping over long distances, may provide a significant cost advantage to the customer, emphasizing the importance of rail or barge access for low cost delivery. As a result, facility location and logistics capabilities are among the most important considerations for producers, distributors and customers.
All of the product sold from our Wyeville and Augusta facilities is shipped by rail from approximately 32,000 feet and 38,000 feet, respectively, of track that connects our facilities to a Union Pacific Railroad mainline. All of the product sold from our Blair and Whitehall facilities is shipped by rail from approximately 45,000 feet and 38,000 feet, respectively, of track that connects our facility to a Canadian National Railway mainline. These rail spurs, size of the rail yards and the capacity of the associated product storage silos allow us to accommodate a large number of rail cars, including unit trains, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ frac sand transportation needs. All of the product sold from our Kermit facilities is delivered by truck to the wellsite from 12 on-site silos with 36,000 tons of storage capacity. 
Terminal Facilities
We generally operate our terminal locations under long-term lease agreements with third-party operators or short-line rail companies. Some of these lease agreements include performance requirements, which typically specify a minimum number of rail cars that must be processed by us each year through the terminal. Each owned or operated terminal location is strategically positioned in the shale plays so that our customers typically do not need to travel more than 75 miles from the wellsite to purchase their frac sand requirements. Our terminals include rail-to-truck and, at silo storage locations, rail-to-storage capabilities.
Once the frac sand is loaded into rail cars at the origin, we utilize an extensive network through a combination of Class I and short-line railroads to move the sand to our terminals. For our terminals with silo storage capabilities, frac sand is loaded into delivery trucks directly from our silos. Our silos deploy sand via gravity to trucks stationed directly on scales under each silo with the loading, electronic recording of weight and dispatch of the truck capable of being completed in less than five minutes. Silos are considerably more efficient than conveyors, which require trucks to be loaded and then moved to separate scales to be weighed; however, frac sand can also be unloaded to delivery trucks directly via a conveyor. 
Logistics and Wellsite Operations
Our logistics and wellsite operations, named Pronghorn Energy Services, utilize silo systems and/or containers, and maintain strict proppant quality control from the mine to the blender, while also addressing environmental concerns through reduction of particulate matter emissions. We handle the full spectrum of logistics management, from railcar fleet management to truck dispatching and dedicated wellsite operation, structurally reducing costs for customers by eliminating inefficiencies throughout the proppant delivery process. Pronghorn Energy Services provide increased transportation efficiency and reduces supply chain related congestion at the wellsite, decreasing the number of trucks required per job and decreasing or eliminating trucking demurrage costs. Our logistics and wellsite operations are designed to meet or exceed the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSH Act") respirable crystalline silica standards that became effective in June 2018 for most aspects of hydraulic fracturing, as well as the engineering control obligations in connection with hydraulic fracturing that are set to become effective in 2021. Pronghorn Energy Services help eliminate supply risk and improve efficiency with the industry’s only fully integrated solution offering both silo systems and containers.
Silos: Our silo systems optimize the well pad with more proppant tons per square foot. The silos manage large sand quantities or high rates of pumping in a small footprint. The customizable wellsite configurations meet most space requirements. With a variety of silo configurations and sizes, and crane-free hydraulic lift and transport, our silo systems provide maximum flexibility and improve safety. Our silo systems provide flexible, high capacity proppant delivery options using hopper bottom and pneumatic trailers. An innovative conveyor system, the Atlas, speeds unloading while a state-of-the-art telescopic discharge tube top-fills silos in significantly less the time of traditional pneumatic systems. We believe the silo systems are the ideal choice for multi-well operations and high proppant intensity well completions.
Containers: Our container service involves loading proppant into containers before being transported by truck to the wellsite. The containers utilize intermodal container chassis or standard flatbeds for transportation, resulting in significant savings in terms of up-front and ongoing operations costs versus widely used pneumatic equipment. Our container service also provides flexible and scalable storage at the wellsite compared to silo solutions and more precise delivery of proppant into the blender hopper. Individual, coded containers reduce the risk of product contamination and stranded product, and preserve proppant integrity and mix flexibility at the blender. On single-well locations and when pad access is difficult or limited, we believe our containers are a compact, flexible logistics solution that optimizes delivery and wellsite footprint.
At the wellsite, the PropBeast® conveyor system significantly reduces noise and dust emissions due to its enclosed environment.  Gravity fed loading and unloading results in faster operations and greatly reduces proppant degradation. PropBeast conveyors can transfer approximately 60,000 pounds of proppant per minute into blender hoppers while reducing particulate matter emissions from sand operations at the wellsite by more than 90% versus the widely used pneumatic equipment alternative. 
Competition 
There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of the United States with which we compete. Our main public and private competitors, including logistics only providers, include:

• | Atlas Sand Company, LLC;


• | Black Mountain Sand Holdings, LLC;


• | Covia Holdings Corporation (NYSE: CVIA);


• | Smart Sand, Inc. (NASDAQ: SND);


• | Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. (NYSE: SOI);


• | Total Sand Solutions;


• | U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SLCA); and 


• | Vista Proppants and Logistics, LLC.

The most important factors on which we compete are price, reliability of supply, transportation capabilities, product quality, performance and sand characteristics. Demand for frac sand and related logistics, as well as the prices that we will be able to obtain for our products and services are closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number of stages completed and the mesh size and amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of proppant.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation
Mining and Workplace Safety
Federal Regulation
Our frac sand mining operations are subject to the oversight of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA"), which is the primary regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the commercial silica industry. MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. The MSHA administers and enforces the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ("MSH Act") to substantiate compliance with mandatory miner safety and health standards. As part of MSHA’s oversight, its representatives must perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each surface mining facility in its jurisdiction. To date, these inspections have not resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards at our mining facilities.
We also are subject to the requirements of the OSH Act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers with federal oversight provided primarily by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). OSHA has adopted and implemented a Hazard Communication Standard that requires information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and the public. OSHA regulates the users of commercial silica and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits and it's Hazard Communication Standard. In 2016, OSHA published a final rule that established a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and provided other provisions protective of employees involved in hydraulic fracturing activities including handling of frac sand. See Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on mining safety and health standards, financial assurance requirements relating to reclamation and restoration of mining property; respirable crystalline silica-related regulatory standards and other legal requirements relating to miner protection.
Health and Safety Programs
We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling employee exposure to silica dust, which includes a silicosis prevention program comprised of routine dust sampling, medical surveillance, training and other components. Our safety program is designed to ensure compliance with MSHA and OSHA regulations. For health and safety standards, hazard and risk assessment tools and critical task specific awareness, extensive training is provided to employees. We have daily pre-task meetings and safety toolbox meetings at all our plants with personnel and conduct monthly focus fatality hazard prevention assessments as well as quarterly corporate health and safety compliance audits. Additionally, we perform annual internal health and safety system audits and conduct random crisis management drills to test our abilities to respond to various situations. Health and safety programs are administered by our corporate health and safety department with the assistance of plant Environmental, Health and Safety Coordinators.
Environmental Matters
We and the commercial silica industry are subject to extensive governmental environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, environmental permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, air emissions and water discharges, soil and groundwater contamination, waste management, hazardous materials, land use, remediation, reclamation and restoration of properties and natural resources. A variety of federal, state and local agencies implement and enforce these laws and regulations. See Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing; air emissions, including climate change and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions; water availability and discharges, plant and wildlife protection; and other legal requirements relating to environmental protection.
Federal Regulation
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a Clean Water Act Section 402 permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or an analogous state agency to whom the EPA has delegated implementation of the permit program. With respect to our frac sand processing facilities in Wisconsin and Texas, those state agencies include the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR") and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ"), respectively. Additionally, we may be obligated to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits issued by the WDNR and TCEQ for stormwater runoff associated with construction activities. Also, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
The federal Clean Air Act ("CAA") and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify operational practices, and obtain permits for existing or new operations. Before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs to comply with these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and comparable state laws and regulations. Furthermore, regulatory bodies at the federal, tribal, regional, state and local levels in the United States, as well as internationally, and certain non-governmental organizations have been increasingly focused on climate change issues including GHG emissions. The EPA has adopted regulations under authority of the existing CAA that impose reporting obligations with respect to GHG emissions, including methane and restrictions on various regulated entities including our E&P customers, which obligations and restrictions may increase our customers' costs of conducting operations and adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas they produce, which could reduce demand for the fracturing sand that we mine, process and sell.
As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these substances. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including claims for injuries to persons or damages to natural resources and properties. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed of or arranged for disposal, including offsite disposal, of a hazardous substance generated or released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes that regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the authority of the EPA, most states, including the WDNR in Wisconsin and the TCEQ in Texas, administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. RCRA currently exempts certain drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Repeal or modification of the current RCRA exclusion or similar exemptions under state law could increase the amount of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and could cause us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, which could significantly reduce demand for our products and services.
Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all "major federal actions," which could include a major development project, such as a mining operation, significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review, which may result in a delay or cancellation of the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the federal Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with, and are potentially subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.
State and Local Regulation
We are also subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin and Texas where our production facilities are located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations and scenic areas. Wisconsin, Texas and some other states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements.
Certain local communities in which we operate, primarily in Wisconsin, have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize the potential for dust to become airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly restrict the area available for mining activities and require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining, among other regulatory initiatives. In addition, our existing permits granted by local regulatory authorities contain certain restrictions on such matters as hours of operation, permitted decibel levels and lighting, among other matters.
The regulatory framework in the jurisdictions in which we do business is potentially subject to amendments or modifications. Planned expansion of our existing facilities as well as the development of new facilities could be significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Delays or inability to obtain required permits for expansion of existing facilities, or the development of new facilities, as well as the increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
Costs of Compliance
We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and worker health and safety requirements applicable to our activities. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; imposition of investigatory, clean-up, and site restoration costs and liens or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the restriction, delay, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations; and the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease some or all of our operations in a particular area. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement, continuance or expansion of a given project. In addition, claims for injuries to persons or damages to natural resources and properties may result from environmental and other impacts of our activities.
The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state and local permits required for our operations involves a significant investment of time and capital. We cannot control the permit approval process. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop, continue or expand a project. Significant opposition and delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop, continue or expand a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Permits 
We operate our facilities under a number of federal, state and local authorizations. We are required to have obtained permits, approvals and/or agreements in order to construct and operate our mining, processing, transloading and material handling facilities and operations in several states. These authorizations address environmental and worker health and safety conditions, and serve to protect public health and welfare. Historically, our properties allocated for mining, and associated operational facilities and equipment, have obtained significant approvals necessary for excavation, extraction and distribution of quality reserves; however, there can be no assurance that such new or renewed approvals will be obtained in the future or that such future new or renewed approvals will not require increased costs or operating restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.
New laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that relate to environmental requirements may result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, delays or cancellations that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
See Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on environmental and mining-related permits and approvals.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 747 employees. In addition, we contract our excavation and trucking operations to third parties and accordingly have no employees directly involved in those operations.
