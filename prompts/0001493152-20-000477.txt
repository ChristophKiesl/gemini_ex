Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc. (referred to herein as “we”, “us” and “our”), together with its wholly-owned and majority-owned controlled subsidiaries is a global clean energy company that owns proprietary technology, SES Gasification Technology (“SGT”), for the low-cost and environmentally responsible production of synthesis gas (referred to as “syngas”). Our focus has been on commercializing our technology both in China and globally through the regional business platforms we have created with partners in Australia, via Australian Future Energy Pty Ltd (“AFE”), in Poland, via SES EnCoal Energy sp. zo. o (“SEE”) and in China, via Tianwo-SES Clean Energy Technologies Limited (“TSEC Joint Venture”).
 
SGT produces syngas that can provide a competitive alternative to other forms of energy such as natural gas, LNG, crude oil and the conventional utilization of coal in boilers for power generation. Our syngas can provide a lower cost energy source in markets where coal, low quality coal, coal wastes, biomass and municipal wastes are available and where natural gas, LNG, and crude oil are expensive or constrained due to lack of infrastructure such as distribution pipelines or power transmission lines, such as Australia, Asia, Eastern Europe and parts of South America. In addition to the economic advantages, we believe our syngas also provides an environmentally responsible option for the manufacturing of chemical, hydrogen, industrial fuel gas and a cleaner option for the generation of power from coal. We believe that our technology is well positioned to be an important solution that addresses the market needs of a changing global energy landscape.
 
Over the past twelve years, we have successfully commercialized SGT primarily through our efforts in China where, between 2006 and 2016, we invested in and built two commercial scale gasification projects together with Chinese partners and sub-licensed SGT into three additional projects in China. In the aggregate, we have completed five commercial scale industrial projects in China over a ten-year period, in which the projects utilize twelve SES proprietary SGT systems. We believe the completion of these projects in China propelled SGT into a globally recognized gasification technology.
 
We have determined that we did not have adequate cash to continue the commercialization of SGT due primarily to our inability to realize financial results from our two investments into projects in China and three technology licensed projects in China as well as our inability to quickly develop alternative technology income sources in Australia, Poland and other global regions. As a result, in our fiscal third quarter and the current quarter, we suspended our global SGT commercialization efforts, we undertook operating expense reductions, we severed our SGT technology resources, we ceased providing funds to project developments as we continue to explore the divesting of assets such as our Yima and TSEC Joint Ventures and we formed a special committee of the board of directors to evaluate financing and restructuring alternatives. On October 10, 2019, we announced the proposed merger with AFE and the acquisition of additional ownership in Batchfire Resources.
 
Proposed Merger with AFE
 
On March 29, 2019, our Board of Directors engaged Clarksons Platou Securities, Inc. (“CPS”) to act as our financial advisors to advise us as we conducted a process to evaluate financing options and strategic alternatives such as but not limited to a strategic merger, a sale, a recapitalization and/or a financing consisting of equity and/or debt securities focused on maximizing shareholder value and protecting the interests of our debtholders.
 
As a result of our efforts evaluating financing and strategic options, on October 10, 2019, we, SES Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of us (“Merger Subsidiary”), and AFE, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, AFE will, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, merge with and into Merger Subsidiary (the “Merger”), the separate corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease and AFE shall be the successor or surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of us. The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Upon the consummation of the Merger, it is contemplated that we will also change our name.
 
Upon consummation of the Merger, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, holders of AFE ordinary shares will receive, in exchange for such ordinary shares, 3,875,000 shares of our common stock. All outstanding stock options and restricted stock will remain outstanding post-Merger on the same terms and conditions as currently applicable to such awards, provided that outstanding awards for departing directors shall be amended to extend exercisability for the term of the award.
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and AFE, including, among other things, if the Merger is not consummated on or before April 15, 2020.
 
We operate our business from our headquarters located in Houston, Texas and our office in Shanghai, China.

Syngas as an Alternative to Conventional Energy Sources
 
Our syngas is used to produce a wide variety of high-value clean energy and chemical products, such as synthetic natural gas, power, methanol, and fertilizer. Syngas can provide a competitive alternative to other forms of energy such as natural gas, LNG, crude oil and conventional utilization of coal in boilers for power generation. Such competing technologies include reforming of natural gas for chemicals and hydrogen production, oil refining for fuels production, petroleum byproducts for plastics, precursors such as olefins and conventional natural gas, fuel oil and coal combustion in power generation equipment and other industrial applications.
 
Our syngas can provide a lower cost energy source in markets where coal, low quality coal, coal wastes, biomass and municipal wastes are available and where natural gas, LNG and crude oil are expensive or constrained due to lack of infrastructure such as distribution pipelines and power transmission lines, such as Australia, Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, while conversely in markets with relatively inexpensive natural gas, LNG and crude oil, we do not anticipate new syngas capacity additions.
 
In addition to economic advantages, we believe our syngas also provides an environmentally responsible option for the manufacturing of chemicals, hydrogen, industrial fuel gas and can provide a cleaner option for the generation of power from coal as it minimizes both air and solid environmental emissions, in addition to utilizing less water.
 
Target Markets
 
Our target markets focus primarily on lower quality coals, biomass and municipal waste where our gasification technology allows energy in the widest range of feedstocks to be unlocked and converted into flexible and valuable syngas. We offer a compelling advantage because of our ability to use such a wide range of solid fuel natural resources. Without our technology, regions where lignite coal, high moisture coal, high ash coal and/or high fines coals exist may face technology barriers which will prevent those resources from being used in energy production. Our technology can transform most of these natural resources into a valuable and flexible syngas products.
 
Our primary focus is on the Australia and Eastern Europe markets through AFE and SEE where each have unique market dynamics where we believe we can deploy our technology can be deployed into projects and provide the investment returns necessary to attract equity investment and debt capital.
 
Our syngas technology provides project owners with what we believe can be a responsible environmental footprint related to harmful pollutants such as nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, airborne mercury and heavy metals and is an efficient and responsible user of water resources. However, we face challenges with the growing anti-coal sentiment primarily in the western world where we are doing business such as in Australia and Eastern Europe. We believe we address this new challenge through utilizing our technology’s ability to blend renewable solid feedstocks with coal or by using only renewable solid feedstocks and/or integration with other technologies that together can produce a lower overall CO2 footprint.
 
While historical uses of gasification technology have predominantly been driven by the chemicals industry, we believe new growth will be within the chemicals industry but will also come from utilization of syngas as a source of industrial fuel gas, as a precursor to hydrogen and SNG production for power generation. We believe that our technology is well positioned to be an important solution that addresses the market needs of the changing global energy landscape. Our gasification technology is unique in its ability to provide an economic, efficient and environmentally responsible alternative to many energy and chemical products normally derived from natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and oil derivatives.
 
Competition
 
Our SGT competes against both, other forms of gasification technology, and other competing technologies that include reforming of natural gas for chemicals and hydrogen production, oil refining for fuels production, petroleum byproducts for plastics, precursors such as olefins and conventional natural gas, fuel oil and coal combustion in power generation equipment and other industrial applications. SGT is most competitive in regions of the world where oil and gas are expensive or have reduced market availability. The energy industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater financial and other resources than we have.
 
SGT offers an economical and cleaner approach for conversion of coal into energy and chemicals through our ability to efficiently and economically gasify a wide range of solid-form natural resources including biomass, low quality coals, high quality coals, and coal wastes. We are not aware of commercially available gasifiers with such a wide range of feedstock flexibility combined with our high carbon conversion efficiency. Our gasification technology is positively differentiated by its ability to provide high carbon conversion efficiency from high ash and high moisture coals without coal rejection due to particle size and without the formation of tars and oils present in the technology of our competitors. We are also positively differentiated in our lower capital costs and lower water usage relative to other gasification technologies.

Historically, the most predominantly deployed western gasification technologies are from Air Products, which has acquired the General Electric technology (previously known as the Texaco technology), Shell’s gasification technology and Lurgi’s technology. Siemens and CB&I have also deployed gasification technology but not at the scale of Air Products. With the exception of Lurgi, these competitors utilized entrained flow slagging gasification technologies. The entrained flow technologies operate on more expensive high grade bituminous and some sub-bituminous coals as feedstocks, but lack capability with the more difficult low heating value, high ash and high moisture coals and with biomass or other renewable waste materials. The Lurgi gasification technology, a moving bed gasification technology, is capable of gasifying many lower grade coals, but has restrictive requirements on its coal feedstock. Also, due to its lower and uneven reaction temperatures, it generates a variety of high volatile hydrocarbon constituents (tars and oils) in the syngas that require expensive downstream removal and can cause the need for additional capital to be spent managing the environmental concerns related to these high volatile constituents that must be removed after the syngas is produced.
 
China has deployed Chinese derivatives of these western technologies on a very large scale, such as East China University and Beijing Aerospace. The Chinese technologies commercialized thus far are derivatives of the historically commercialized western technologies mentioned above and generally fall into the category of entrained flow slagging gasification, and the Chinese have also developed a derivate of the Lurgi technology which has been widely deployed in China. To date, commercialization of these technologies has been primarily inside China.
 
Barriers to New Competition
 
Historically gasification technologies have required many years of development with large sums of research development and commercial demonstration investment required to achieve commercial viability. We believe that the current range of available technologies leaves little incentive for development of new coal-based technologies, and emerging competition for everyone in the industry will likely focus on imitation and adaptation.
 
GTI Agreement
 
In November 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement, (the “GTI Agreement”), with the Gas Technology Institute, (“GTI”), replacing the Amended and Restated License Agreement between us and GTI dated August 31, 2006, as amended. Under the GTI Agreement, we maintain our exclusive worldwide right to license the U-GAS® technology for all types of coals and coal/biomass mixtures with coal content exceeding 60%, as well as the non-exclusive right to license the U-GAS® technology for 100% biomass and coal/biomass blends exceeding 40% biomass.
 
In order to sublicense any U-GAS® system, we are required to comply with certain requirements set forth in the GTI Agreement. In the preliminary stage of developing a potential sublicense, we are required to provide notice and certain information regarding the potential sublicense to GTI and GTI is required to provide notice of approval or non-approval within ten business days of the date of the notice from us, provided that GTI is required to not unreasonably withhold their approval. If GTI does not respond within the ten-business day period, they are deemed to have approved of the sublicense. We are required to provide updates on any potential sublicenses once every three months during the term of the GTI Agreement. We are also restricted from offering a competing gasification technology during the term of the GTI Agreement.
 
For each U-GAS® unit which we license, design, build or operate for ourselves or for a party other than a sub-licensee and which uses coal or a coal and biomass mixture or biomass as the feedstock, we must pay a royalty based upon a calculation using the MMBtu per hour of dry syngas production of a rated design capacity, payable in installments at the beginning and at the completion of the construction of a project, or the Standard Royalty. If we invest, or have the option to invest, in a specified percentage of the equity of a third party, and the royalty payable by such third party for their sublicense exceeds the Standard Royalty, we are required to pay to GTI an agreed percentage split of third party licensing fees, or the Agreed Percentage, of such royalty payable by such third party. However, if the royalty payable by such third party for their sublicense is less than the Standard Royalty, we are required to pay to GTI, in addition to the Agreed Percentage of such royalty payable by such third party, the Agreed Percentage of our dividends and liquidation proceeds from our equity investment in the third party. In addition, if we receive a carried interest in a third party, and the carried interest is less than a specified percentage of the equity of such third party, we are required to pay to GTI, in our sole discretion, either (i) the Standard Royalty or (ii) the Agreed Percentage of the royalty payable to such third party for their sublicense, as well as the Agreed Percentage of the carried interest. We will be required to pay the Standard Royalty to GTI if the percentage of the equity of a third party that we (a) invest in, (b) have an option to invest in, or (c) receive a carried interest in, exceeds the percentage of the third party specified in the preceding sentence.

We are required to make an annual payment to GTI for each year of the term, with such annual payment due by the last day of January of the following year; provided, however, that we are entitled to deduct all royalties paid to GTI in a given year under the GTI Agreement from this amount, and if such royalties exceed the annual payment amount in a given year, we are not required to make the annual payment. We must also provide GTI with a copy of each contract that we enter into relating to a U-GAS® system and report to GTI with our progress on development of the technology every six months.
 
For a period of ten years, beginning in May 2016, we and GTI are restricted from disclosing any confidential information (as defined in the GTI Agreement) to any person other than employees of affiliates or contractors who are required to deal with such information, and such persons will be bound by the confidentiality provisions of the GTI Agreement. We have further indemnified GTI and its affiliates from any liability or loss resulting from unauthorized disclosure or use of any confidential information that we receive.
 
We continue to innovate and modify the SGT process to a point where we maintain certain intellectual property rights over SGT. Since the original licensing in 2004, we have maintained a strong relationship with GTI and continue to benefit from the resources and collaborative work environment that GTI provides us. In relation to the Merger with AFE, AFE and GTI have agreed upon new terms which, subject to a definitive agreement being completed prior to the Merger closing, would replace the current GTI Agreement.
 
Relationships with Strategic Partners and Business Verticals
 
We have focused on completing the evaluation of financing options, strategic alternatives and restructuring efforts and we determined that we do not have the financial or human resources to actively support our strategic partners and business verticals. However, we have worked to maintain the availability, to the extent practical, of these strategic partnerships and business verticals for the Company upon successful completion of a merger or restructuring. Also, we have continued to (i) monitor, support and facilitate our minority ownership interest in BFR in order to realize the financial value through dividend income or other means and (ii) worked to recover cash and monetize our joint venture operations, Yima and TSEC Joint Ventures.
Current Projects
 
Australian Future Energy Pty Ltd
 
In February 2014, we established AFE together with an Australian company, Ambre Investments PTY Limited (“Ambre”). AFE is an independently managed Australian business platform established for the purpose of building a large-scale, vertically integrated business in Australia based on developing, building and owning equity interests in financially attractive and environmentally responsible projects that produce low cost syngas as a competitive alternative to expensive local natural gas and LNG.
 
On June 9, 2015, we entered into a Master Technology Agreement (the “MTA”) with AFE which was later revised on May 10, 2017 (as described below). Pursuant to the MTA, we have conveyed certain exclusive access rights to our gasification technology in Australia focusing on promotion and use of our technology in projects. AFE is the exclusive operational entity for business relating to our technology in Australia and AFE owns no rights to sub-license our technology. AFE will work with us on project license agreements for use of our technology as projects are developed in Australia. In return for its work, AFE will receive a share of any license fee we receive for project licenses in Australia.
 
On May 10, 2017, we entered into a project technology license agreement with AFE in connection with a project being developed by AFE in Queensland Australia. AFE intends to form a subsidiary project company and assign the project technology license agreement to that company which will assume all of the obligations of AFE thereunder. Pursuant to the project technology license agreement, we granted a non-exclusive, license to use our technology at the project to manufacture syngas and to use our technology in the design of the facility. In consideration, the project technology license agreement calls for a license fee to be finalized based on the designed plant capacity and a separate fee of $2.0 million for the delivery of a process design package. The license agreement calls for license fees to be paid as project milestones are reached throughout the planning, construction and first five years of plant operations. The success and timing of the project being developed by AFE will affect if and/or when we will be able to receive all of the payments related to this license agreement. However, there can be no assurance that AFE will be successful in developing this or any other project.
 
In October 2016, AFE completed the creation and spin-off of BFR(as discussed below) as a separate standalone company which acquired and operates the Callide thermal coal mine in Queensland.
 
In August 2017, AFE completed the acquisition of a mine development lease related to the 266-million-ton resource near Pentland, Queensland through AFE’s wholly owned subsidiary, Great Northern Energy Pty Ltd (“GNE”).
 
In July 2018, we entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with AFE to provide short-term funding in order to enable AFE to continue to progress its project related initiatives for the betterment of AFE shareholders and the successful promotion of their projects in the amount of 350,000 Australian Dollars, approximately $260,000. The Loan Agreement had a term of three months, subject to certain events, and an interest rate of 6%. AFE repaid the outstanding principal amount under the Loan Agreement plus interest in August 2018.

In September 2018, AFE’s Gladstone Energy and Ammonia Project (“Gladstone Project”) was formally announced in Queensland Parliament by Minister for State Development, Manufacturing, Innovation and Planning, Mr. Cameron Dick and was declared by the Queensland Co-Ordinator General as a Co-Ordinated Project. A coordinated project approach also means that all the potential impacts and benefits of the project are considered in an integrated and comprehensive manner and the Coordinator-General’s decision to declare this project a Coordinated Project is expected to help streamline approvals and fast-track delivery of the project.
 
The project will be located in the State Development Area in Gladstone, Queensland and is planned to process 1.5 million mtpa of low-quality coal using SGT, to produce up to 330,000 mtpa of ammonia product, and up to 8 petajoules of pipeline quality gas for the east coast domestic gas market. In addition, the proposed project will generate approximately 90 MW of electrical power, with approximately 25 MW of this being available for export to the local domestic grid. The ammonia and gas produced is to be used by major industrial users, including those focusing on agriculture, the mining industry and advanced manufacturing. The project is estimated by AFE to commence construction by early 2021, with the first ammonia production proposed in early 2023.
 
On April 4, 2019, we entered into a Technology Purchase Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with AFE providing AFE with an exclusive option through July 31, 2019 to purchase 100% ownership of Synthesis Energy Systems Technology, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary which owns our interest in the SGT. In addition, ownership rights to SGT were to be carved out of the transaction and retained by us for China and we have a three-year option period post-closing to monetize SGT for India, Brazil, Poland and for the DRI technology market segment. On July 31, 2019, we entered into an Amendment to the Option Agreement with AFE extending the exclusive option provided in the Option Agreement through August 31, 2019. On August 31, 2019, we mutually agreed with AFE to allow the Option Agreement to terminate pursuant to its terms and no penalties or payments were due as a result of the termination of the agreement.
 
AFE issued one million shares to us in connection with the execution of the Option Agreement. AFE would also pay (i) an additional $2.0 million in three equal installments, with the first installment paid at closing and the remainder over the subsequent twelve months, and (ii) $3.8 million on the earlier of the closing of a construction financing by AFE or five years from closing. The closing of the transaction was subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements and other conditions specified in the Option Agreement. In addition to the payment schedule above, AFE issued an additional one million shares with the execution of the Option Agreement and would also pay an additional $100,000 with the first installment paid at closing as full and final settlement of outstanding invoices owing AFE to us at the date of this Option Agreement. As a result of the termination, we retained the two million shares AFE issued in connection with the Option Agreement. We accounted for the first million shares as an additional investment in AFE and a reduction of the receivable amounts due from AFE with a fair value of $100,000. The second million shares were accounted for as an additional investment in AFE and a deferred liability in the amount of $70,000 as a down payment on the purchase of our subsidiary.
 
For our ownership interest in AFE, we have been contributing cash and engineering support for AFE’s business development while Ambre contributed cash and services. Additional ownership in AFE has been granted to the AFE management team and staff individuals providing services to AFE. In August 2017 and March 2018, we elected to make additional contributions of $0.47 million and $0.16 million respectively to assist AFE with developing its business in Australia. In April 2019, we were issued two million shares in connection with the Option Agreement and its subsequent termination.
 
See “Proposed Merger with AFE” for a discussion of the Merger with AFE.
 
Batchfire Resources Pty Ltd
 
As a result of AFE’s early stage business development efforts associated with the Callide thermal coal mine in Central Queensland, Australia, AFE created BFR. BFR was a spin-off company for which ownership interest was distributed to the existing shareholders of AFE and to the new BFR management team in December 2015. BFR is registered in Australia and was formed for the purpose of purchasing the Callide thermal coal mine from Anglo-American plc (“Anglo-American”). The Callide mine is one of the largest thermal coal mines in Australia and has been in operation for more than 40 years.
 
In October 2016, BFR stated that it had received investment support for the acquisition from Singapore-based Lindenfels Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of commodity traders Avra Commodities, and as a result, the acquisition of the Callide thermal coal mine from Anglo-American was completed.
 
In January 2018, the Minister of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy approved BFR’s mining lease application through to 2043 for Callide’s Boundary Hill South Project. The Callide mining tenure extends across 180 square kilometers and contains an estimated coal resource of up to 1.7 billion metric tons and saleable coal production averages 10 million metric tons per year. BFR is implementing its mining plan at Callide intended to lower the per unit mining costs and deliver profitable financial results.

On April 29, 2019, BFR issued additional shares as part of a rights offering. We did not execute our rights in this offering and therefore after the completion of the offering process and the issuance of the additional shares, our ownership interest has been diluted from approximately 11% to approximately 7%.
 
In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, we entered into Share Exchange Agreements (each, a “Share Exchange Agreement”) with certain of the shareholders of BFR, whereby such shareholders will exchange their shares of BFR for shares of common stock at a ratio of 10 BFR shares for one share of common stock. As a result of these exchanges, we would own 25% of the outstanding shares of BFR. The closing of the exchange is subject to certain conditions specified in the Share Exchange Agreements, including, without limitation, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In addition, we are making an offer to the remaining shareholders of BFR such that we would acquire 100% of the shares if the offers are all accepted.
 
Cape River Resources Pty Ltd
 
In October 2018, AFE formed a separate unrelated company, Cape River Resources Pty Ltd (“CRR”) for the purpose of developing the Pentland resource into an operating thermal coal mine. Ownership in CRR was distributed proportionately to the shareholders of AFE with additional shares issued to the management team. Our ownership in CRR was approximately 38% upon the formation of CRR through our ownership interest in AFE. GNE sold its 100% ownership interest in the Pentland Coal Mine to CRR.
 
In September 2019, AFE repurchased all of the shares in CRR in exchange for AFE shares. The CRR shareholders received one share of AFE for every ten shares of CRR. As a result of the transaction, CRR is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AFE. CRR owns the Pentland Coal Resource which is a 266 million metric tonne thermal coal resource located approximately 230 kms southwest of Townsville in Queensland, Australia. The project is well located with good access to rail, road and mains power. The project is not being actively pursued at present due to funding restraints and the focus of AFE on the Gladstone Energy and Ammonia Project. Following the completion of the proposed Merger, it is intended to devote additional funding and resources to this project.
 
Townsville Metals Infrastructure Pty Ltd
 
In August 2018, AFE formed a separate unrelated company, Townsville Metals Infrastructure Pty Ltd (“TMI”) for the purpose of completing the development of the required infrastructure such as rail and port modifications related to the transport of mined products including coal from the Pentland resource to the Townsville port. Ownership in TMI was distributed proportionately to the shareholders of AFE. Our ownership in TMI is approximately 38% upon the formation of TMI through our ownership interest in AFE.
 
SES EnCoal Energy sp. z o.o
 
In October 2017, we entered into agreements with Warsaw-based EnInvestments sp. z o.o. Under the terms of the agreements, we and EnInvestments are equal shareholders of SEE and SEE will exclusively market, develop, and commercialize projects in Poland which utilize our technology, services, and proprietary equipment and we share with SEE a portion of the technology license payments, net of fees, we receive from Poland. The goal of SEE is to establish efficient clean energy projects that provide Polish industries superior economic benefits as compared to the use of expensive, imported natural gas and LNG, while providing energy independence through our technological capabilities to convert the wide range of Poland’s indigenous coals, coal waste, biomass and municipal waste to valuable syngas products. SEE has developed a pipeline of projects and together with us is actively working with Polish customers and partners to complete necessary project feasibility, permitting, and SGT agreement steps required prior to starting construction on the projects.
 
Tauron Wytwarzanie S.A., (“Tauron”), has contracted Poland’s Institute of Coal Chemistry (“IChPW”) to complete a detailed preliminary design assessment and economic study for the conversion of its 200MW conventional power boilers to clean syngas which would be Poland’s first SGT facility. The project feasibility study concluded in March 2018 with positive results. The results presented by IChPW to Tauron have shown that the conversion of Tauron’s 200 MW power boiler utilizing SGT can be both economically attractive and environmentally beneficial. We believe that SGT power boiler conversions are an ideal solution capable of meeting EU and IED targets.
 
For our ownership interest in SEE, we have been contributing cash and assisting in the development of SEE. SEE was initially funded in January 2018 with a cash contribution of approximately $6,000 and an additional funding in March 2018 of approximately $76,000. In August 2018, we made an additional cash contribution of approximately $11,000.

Midrex Technologies
 
In July 2015, we entered into a Project Alliance Agreement that expands our exclusive relationship with Midrex Technologies for integration and optimization of DRI technology using coal gasification. Midrex has taken the lead in marketing, sales, proposal development, and project execution for coal gasification DRI projects as part of the new project alliance. Midrex may also lead the construction of the fully integrated solution for customers who desire such an execution strategy. We will provide the DRI gasification technology for each project including engineering, key equipment, and technical services. The agreement includes finalization of an engineering package for the optimized coal gasification DRI solution. Prior to the Project Alliance Agreement, we also entered into an exclusive agreement with the TSEC Joint Venture and Midrex for the joint marketing of coal gasification-based DRI facilities in China. These facilities will combine our gasification technology with the Direct Reduction Process of Midrex to create syngas from low quality coals in order to convert iron ore into high-purity DRI. The TSEC Joint Venture will aid in the marketing of these DRI facilities in China and will supply the gasification equipment and licensing of the technology.
Yima Joint Venture
 
In August 2009, we entered into joint venture contracts and related agreements with Yima Coal Industry Group Company (“Yima”), replacing the prior joint venture contracts entered in October 2008 and April 2009. The joint ventures were formed for each of the gasification, methanol/methanol protein production, and utility island components of the plant (collectively the “Yima Joint Venture”). The joint venture contracts provided that we and Yima contribute equity of 25% and 75%, respectively, to the Yima Joint Venture. The remaining capital for the project construction has been funded with project debt obtained by the Yima Joint Venture. Yima agreed to guarantee the project debt in order to secure debt financing from domestic Chinese banking sources. We agreed to pledge to Yima our ownership interests in the joint ventures as security for our obligations. In the event that the necessary additional debt financing is not obtained, Yima agreed to provide a loan to the joint venture to satisfy the remaining capital needs of the project with terms comparable to current market rates at the time of the loan. Yima also agreed to provide coal to the project at preferential pricing under a side-letter agreement related to the JV contracts. Despite our efforts, to date, Yima has not provided coal at preferential price to the project and we do not believe Yima will do so in the future.
 
The term of the joint venture commenced June 9, 2009 at the time each joint venture company obtained its business operating license and shall end 30 years after the business license issue date, June 8, 2039. As discussed below, in November 2016, as part of an overall corporate restructuring plan, these joint ventures were combined into a single joint venture.
 
We continue to own a 25% interest in the Yima Joint Venture and Yima owns a 75% interest. Notwithstanding this, in connection with an expansion of the project, we have the option to contribute a greater percentage of capital for the expansion, such that as a result, we could expand through contributions, at our election, up to a 49% ownership interest in the Yima Joint Venture.
 
In 2016, the plant faced increasing regulatory scrutiny from the environmental and safety bureaus as the plant was not built in full compliance with its original submitted designs. In June 2016, the local environmental bureau requested that the plant temporarily halt operations to address certain issues identified by the environmental bureau. These issues affected the joint venture’s ability to receive its final operating and safety permits and were related to the original approval for methanol protein production and the original three JV business structure. This has been addressed and fully resolved and the three joints ventures were combined into one in November 2016. The Yima Joint Venture returned to operations in late November 2016 and in November 2017, the Yima Joint Venture completed the required safety testing and successfully received its safety production permit from the Henan government and it subsequently received the Industry Products License in May 2018, allowing for its products to be sold on the open market and an updated business license was successfully obtained in January 2018.
 
Since the plant restored operations in November 2016, it has had periods of running at full design capacity and periods of operations at lower levels of production. The primary operational issues have been related to operational errors, equipment quality that has caused increased downtime and the failure to secure coal supply. The plant experienced its first 90-day period in which it operated at full capacity ending in August 2017. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the plant produced 284,642 tons of pure methanol, its best fiscal year performance to date besting the plant production of 185,761 tons of pure methanol for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We continue to see signs of overall improvement in operations, resulting in longer periods of production at design capacity. In May 2019, the plant was idled to perform its annual maintenance. Due to lack of funds and a decrease in the price of methanol the maintenance program was delayed. The plant remained idled from May 2019 until November 2019.
 
In December 2017 and January 2018, on-going development cooperation and discussions with the Yima Joint Venture management resulted in the joint venture agreeing to pay various costs incurred by us during the construction and commissioning period of the facility in the amount of approximately 16 million Chinese Renminbi yuan, (“RMB”) (approximately $2.5 million). As of June 30, 2018, we have received 6.15 million RMB (approximately $0.9 million) of payments from the Yima Joint Venture related to these costs. Due to uncertainty, revenues will be recorded upon receipt of payment. Despite our continuous collection efforts, we have not received any additional payments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.

Tianwo-SES Clean Energy Technologies Limited
 
Joint Venture Contract
 
In February 2014, SES Asia Technologies Limited, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a Joint Venture Contract (the “JV Contract”) with Zhangjiagang Chemical Machinery Co., Ltd., which subsequently changed its legal name to Suzhou Thvow Technology Co. Ltd. (“STT”), to form the TSEC Joint Venture. The purpose of the TSEC Joint Venture is to establish SGT as the leading gasification technology in the TSEC Joint Venture territory (which is China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Mongolia and Malaysia) by becoming a leading provider of proprietary equipment and engineering services for SGT. The scope of the TSEC Joint Venture is to market and license SGT via project sublicenses, procurement and sale of proprietary equipment and services, coal testing, engineering, procurement and research and development related to SGT. STT contributed 53.8 million RMB (approximately $8.0 million) in April 2014 and was required to contribute an additional 46.2 million RMB (approximately $6.8 million) within two years of such date for a total contribution of 100 million RMB (approximately $14.8 million) in cash to the TSEC Joint Venture in return for a 65% ownership interest in the TSEC Joint Venture. The second capital contribution from STT of 46.2 million RMB (approximately $6.8 million) was not paid by STT in April 2016 as required by the initial JV Contract. As part of a restructuring of the agreement described below, the obligation for payment of additional registered capital was removed.
 
We contributed certain exclusive technology sub-licensing rights into the TSEC Joint Venture for the territory pursuant to the terms of a Technology Usage and Contribution Agreement (the “TUCA”) entered into among the TSEC Joint Venture, STT and us on the same date and further described in more detail below. This resulted in our original ownership of 35% of the TSEC Joint Venture. Under the JV Contract, neither party may transfer their interests in the TSEC Joint Venture without first offering such interests to the other party.
 
In August 2017, we entered into a restructuring agreement of the TSEC Joint Venture (“Restructuring Agreement”). The agreed change in share ownership, reduction in the registered capital of the joint venture, and the final transfer of shares with local government authorities was completed in December 2017. In this restructuring, an additional party was added to the JV Contract, upon receipt of final government approvals, The Innovative Coal Chemical Design Institute (“ICCDI”) became a 25% owner of the TSEC Joint Venture, we decreased our ownership to 25% and STT decreased its ownership to 50%. ICCDI previously served as general contractor and engineered and constructed all three projects which utilize SGT in seven gasification systems for the Aluminum Corporation of China. Equipment orders related to these projects were secured by our joint venture partner, STT. The projects are located in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, have been completed and are currently operating for the Aluminum Corporation of China.
 
We received 11.15 million RMB (approximately $1.7 million) from ICCDI as a result of this restructuring. In conjunction with the joint venture restructuring, we also received 1.2 million RMB (approximately $180,000) related to outstanding invoices for services we had provided to the TSEC Joint Venture. The inclusion of ICCDI as an owner has the potential to enhance the joint venture’s bidding ability and we believe the joint venture will focus on securing larger coal to chemical projects as well as continue to pursue projects in the industrial fuels segment.
 
In addition to the ownership changes described above, the TSEC Joint Venture is now managed by a board of directors (the “Board”) consisting of eight directors, four appointed by STT, two appointed by ICCDI and two appointed by us. All significant acts as described in the JV Contract require the unanimous approval of the Board.
 
The JV Contract also includes a non-competition provision which requires that the TSEC Joint Venture be the exclusive legal entity within the TSEC Joint Venture territory for the marketing and sale of any gasification technology or related equipment that utilizes low quality coal feedstock. Notwithstanding this, STT retained the right to manufacture and sell gasification equipment outside the scope of the TSEC Joint Venture within the TSEC Joint Venture territory. In addition, we retained the right to develop and invest equity in projects outside of the TSEC Joint Venture within the TSEC Joint Venture territory. As a result of the Restructuring Agreement, we have further retained the right to provide SGT licenses and to sell proprietary equipment directly into projects in the TSEC Joint Venture territory provided we have an equity interest in the project. After the termination of the TSEC Joint Venture, STT and ICCDI must obtain written consent from us to market development of any gasification technology that utilizes low quality coal feedstock in the TSEC Joint Venture territory.
 
The JV Contract may be terminated upon, among other things: (i) a material breach of the JV Contract which is not cured; (ii) a violation of the TUCA; (iii) the failure to obtain positive net income within 24 months of establishing the TSEC Joint Venture or (iv) mutual agreement of the parties.
 
TUCA
 
Pursuant to the TUCA, we have contributed to the TSEC Joint Venture certain exclusive rights to our SGT in the TSEC Joint Venture territory, including the right to: (i) grant site specific project sub-licenses to third parties; (ii) use our marks for proprietary equipment and services; (iii) engineer and/or design processes that utilize our SGT or our other intellectual property; (iv) provide engineering and design services for joint venture projects and (v) take over the development of projects in the TSEC Joint Venture territory that have previously been developed by us and our affiliates. As a result of the Restructuring Agreement, ICCDI was added as a party to the TUCA, but all other material terms remained the same.

The TSEC Joint Venture will be the exclusive operational entity for business relating to SGT in the TSEC Joint Venture territory, except for projects in which we have an equity ownership position. For these projects, as a result of the Restructuring Agreement, we can provide technology and equipment directly, with no obligation to the joint venture. If the TSEC Joint Venture loses exclusivity due to a breach by us, STT and ICCDI are to be compensated for direct losses and all lost project profits. We were also required to provide training for technical personnel of the TSEC Joint Venture through the second anniversary of the establishment of the TSEC Joint Venture, which has now passed. We will also provide a review of engineering works for the TSEC Joint Venture. If modifications are suggested by us and not made, the TSEC Joint Venture bears the liability resulting from such failure. If we suggest modifications and there is still liability resulting from the engineering work, it is our liability.
 
Any party making improvements, whether patentable or not, relating to SGT after the establishment of the TSEC Joint Venture, grants to the other party an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty free right to use or license such improvements and agrees to make such improvements available to us free of charge. All such improvements shall become part of SGT and all parties shall have the same rights, licenses and obligations with respect to the improvement as contemplated by the TUCA.
 
Any breach of or default under the TUCA which is not cured on notice entitles the non-breaching party to terminate. The TSEC Joint Venture indemnifies us for misuse of SGT or infringement of SGT upon rights of any third party.
 
Business Development, Engineering and Project Management
 
Management and Business Development Staff
 
We currently employ a staff of three employees and access to several contractors in addition to the Board of Directors, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Corporate Controller. In addition, we utilize consultants and our relationships with our strategic partners to further supplement our staff in developing relationships with potential customers, engineering and project management.
Business Concentration
 
Our assets related to the corporate office and the technology accounted for approximately 93% of our total assets as of June 30, 2019. While all of the operating plants using our technology are located in China, we are primarily focused on restructuring the Company through the Merger Agreement and emphasizing opportunities outside of China, primarily in Australia.
Suppliers
 
In China, through our strategic relationships, we have been successful in locating and contracting with a number of key suppliers of major equipment and services. For projects outside of China, we would plan to continue to leverage our strong ties and partnerships in China to provide low cost equipment and engineering into our projects. In locations where local sourcing is of value, we expect to be able to develop supply chain capabilities for our equipment utilizing experienced industrial manufacturing capabilities and low-cost sources of labor and materials that will benefit our technology if and/or when necessary.
Patents
 
We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and a number of pending patent applications, primarily relating to new technology developments that we have made to the U-GAS® technology, known as SGT. This includes our gasification process, the integration of our gasification process with downstream uses and the equipment design for our gasification facilities. Although in the aggregate our patents are important to us, we do not regard any individual patent as critical or essential to our business.
 
Prior to us entering into the GTI Agreement, U-GAS® had not been commercially deployed on coal above approximately 150 tons per day per gasification system nor had it been commercially deployed on coal using pure oxygen as a reactant or at elevated pressures. Today, we have commercially deployed SGT at a scale of 1,200 tons per day of coal feed using pure oxygen as a reactant and at pressures of up to 10 bar. Our new designs allow for quoting gasification systems to customers that would increase our gasification capacity to approximately 3,000 tons per day of coal using pure oxygen as a reactant at pressures up to 55 bar. We have made improvements to the U-GAS technology which have either been patented, are in the process of patenting, or are held by us as trade secrets.

Project and Technical Development
 
We have in the past incurred internal and third-party project and technical development costs related to the advancement of our gasification technology and related processes. We no longer plan to continue the technical development initiatives to support project development activities.
Environmental Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to stringent national, provincial state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, including various Chinese and Australian authorities, issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before construction or operation at a facility commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with such activities, limit or prohibit construction activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution.
 
Our facilities may require permits for or be constrained by permit conditions in relation to acceptable air emissions and wastewater discharges, as well as other authorizations, some of which must be issued before construction commences. Issuance of these permits could be subject to unpredictable delays, contests and even, in some cases, denial or refusal. Although we believe that there will be support for our projects, the permitting process could be complex and time consuming and the issuance of permits may be subject to the potential for contest and other regulatory uncertainties that may result in unpredictable delays. We are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements.
 
In addition, some recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” may be contributing to the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. In response to such studies, many countries are actively considering legislation, or have already taken legal measures, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Examples of such legislation and new legal measures include new environmental laws and regulations that could impose a carbon tax, a cap and trade program requiring us to purchase carbon credits, or measures that would require reductions in emissions or require modification of raw materials, fuel use or production rates. In China, the Environmental Protection Tax Law entered into force on January 1, 2018, pursuant to which enterprises that directly discharge taxable pollutants within the territory of China and maritime space under its justification shall pay environmental protection tax. This legislation includes two appendices, one of which provides for the tax rate of different pollutants and the other lists taxable pollutants and pollution equivalent. According to this legislation, the environmental protection tax has replaced the pollutant discharge fee since January 1, 2018.
 
Carbon dioxide (CO2), a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as coal, is an example of a greenhouse gas. Regardless of technology used in gasification facilities, there is carbon dioxide released whenever the syngas is cleaned and prepared for energy or chemicals production. We believe that gasification is currently the most desirable technology for processing coal if CO2 emissions become regulated. This is because gasification and the adjacent syngas cleaning technologies separate the CO2 produced from the final products and thereby create a rich CO2 stream that can be captured, sequestered and/or sold. However, greenhouse gas regulations can add production and capital cost to all fossil fuel technologies and may require us or our customers to obtain additional permits, meet additional control requirements, install additional environmental mitigation equipment, or take other as yet unknown steps to comply with such potential regulations, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
 
In 2013, the U.S. and a number of international development banks, including the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, announced that they would no longer provide financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants or would do so only in narrowly defined circumstances. Other international development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank and the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, have continued to provide such financing.
 
The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in December 1997 by the signatories to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), established a binding set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed nations. The U.S. signed the Kyoto Protocol, but it has never been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol in December 2007 and became a full member in March 2008. There were discussions to develop a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol after the expiration of its commitment period in 2012, including at the UNFCCC conferences in Copenhagen (2009), Cancun (2010), Durban (2011), Doha (2012) and Paris (2015). At the Durban conference, an ad hoc working group was established to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the UNFCCC, applicable to all parties. At the Doha meeting, an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, which included new commitments for certain parties in a second commitment period, from 2013 to 2020. In December 2012, Australia signed on to the second commitment period. During the UNFCCC conference in Paris, France in late 2015, an agreement was adopted calling for voluntary emissions reductions contributions after the second commitment period ends in 2020. The agreement was entered into force on November 4, 2016 after ratification and execution by more than 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Both Australia and the United States ratified the agreement. On August 4, 2017 the United States formally signaled its intention to withdraw from the agreement (although it has not yet withdrawn).

Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power stations could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. The potential financial impact on us of future laws, regulations or other policies will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws, regulations or other policies, the time periods over which those laws, regulations or other policies would be phased in, the state of commercial development and deployment of CCUS technologies and the alternative uses for coal. From time to time, we attempt to analyze the potential impact on the Company of as-yet-unadopted, potential laws, regulations and policies. Such analysis require that we make significant assumptions as to the specific provisions of such potential laws, regulations and policies. These analyses sometimes show that certain potential laws, regulations and policies, if implemented in the manner assumed by the analyses, could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these potential laws, regulations and policies. We do not believe that such analyses reasonably predict the quantitative impact that future laws, regulations or other policies may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 
Australian Regulatory Matters
 
Native Title and Cultural Heritage. Since 1992, the Australian courts have recognized that native title to lands, as recognized under the laws and customs of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, may have survived the process of European settlement. These developments are supported by Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) which recognizes and protects native title, and under which a national register of native title claims and determinations has been established. Native title rights do not extend to minerals; however, native title rights can be affected by the mining process unless those rights have previously been extinguished thereby requiring negotiation with the registered native title claimants or determined native title holders (as applicable) (and potentially the payment of compensation) prior to the grant of certain mining tenements. There is also federal and state legislation to prevent damage to and manage Aboriginal cultural heritage and archaeological sites.
 
Mining Tenements and Environmental. In Queensland and New South Wales, the development of a mine requires both the grant of a right to extract the resource and an approval which authorizes the environmental impact. These approvals are obtained under separate legislation from separate government authorities. The application processes can run concurrently and are also concurrent with any native title or cultural heritage process that is required. The environmental impacts of mining projects are regulated by state and federal governments. Federal regulation will only apply if the particular project will, or is likely to, significantly impact a matter of national environmental significance (for example, a water resource, an endangered species or particular protected places). Environmental approvals processes involve complex issues that, on occasion, require lengthy studies and documentation. Typically mining proponents must also reach agreement with the owners of land underlying proposed mining tenements prior to the grant and/or conduct of mining activities or otherwise acquire the land. These arrangements generally involve the payment of compensation in lieu of the impacts of mining on the land.
 
Australian mining operations are generally subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations. At the federal level, these legislative acts include, but are not limited to, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth). Foreign investors into Australia may also require approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board.
 
In Queensland, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld), Mineral and Energy Resources (Common Provisions) Act 2014 (Qld) (MERCP Act), Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) (EP Act), Environmental Protection Regulation 2019 (Qld), potentially the Planning Act 2016 (Qld), Building Act 1975 (Qld), Explosives Act 1999 (Qld), Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld), Native Title (Queensland) Act 1993 (Qld), Water Act 2000 (Qld), State Development and Public Works Organization Act 1971 (Qld), Queensland Heritage Act 1992 (Qld), Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 (Qld), Nature Conservation Act 1992 (Qld), Vegetation Management Act 1999 (Qld), Land Act 1994 (Qld), Regional Planning Interests Act 2014 (Qld), Fisheries Act 1994 (Qld) and the Forestry Act 1959 (Qld). Under the EP Act, policies have been developed to achieve the objectives of the law and provide guidance on specific areas of the environment, including air, noise, water and waste management. Increased emphasis has recently been placed on topics including, but not limited to, hazardous dams assessment, the assessment and provision of financial assurance and undertaking rehabilitation of mining activities. On April 1, 2019, amendments to the EP Act (by way of the Mineral and Energy Resources (Financial Provisioning) Act 2018 (Qld) (MERFP Act)) took effect to implement a new risk-based framework and new financial provisioning requirements in the undertaking resource activities in Queensland. The financial provisioning scheme now in place features a pooled scheme fund and expanded surety and security options operated by an appointed Scheme Manager. On November 1, 2019, further amendments to the EP Act by way of the MERFP Act commenced, which requires on a transitional basis, all holders of an environmental authority for site-specific mining activities to prepare a “progressive rehabilitation and closure plan”(PRCP) which details how and where activities will be carried out on the land in a way that maximizes the progressive rehabilitation of the land to a stable condition. The PRCP must be approved by the administering authority and include a PRCP Schedule (that identifies post-mining land uses, any non-use management areas, milestones and conditions) which must be complied with. Further EP Act reforms are expected during 2020 in relation to residual risk issues.

The MERCP Act commenced on September 27, 2016 and included significant reforms to the management of overlapping coal and coal seam gas tenements and the coordination of activities and access to private and public land. In November 2016, amendments to the EP Act and the Water Act 2000 (Qld) became effective and facilitate regulatory scrutiny of the environmental impacts of underground water extraction during the operational phase of resource projects for all tenements yet to commence mineral extraction. The ‘Chain of Responsibility’ provisions of the EP Act, effective in April 2016, allow the regulator to issue an environmental protection order (EPO) to a related person of a company in two circumstances; (a) if an EPO has been issued to the company, an EPO can also be issued to a related person of the company (at the same time or later); or (b) if the company is a high risk company (as defined in the EP Act), an EPO can be issued to a related person of the company (whether or not an EPO has also been issued to the company). A guideline has been issued to provide more certainty to industry on the circumstances when an EPO may be issued.
 
In New South Wales, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mining Act 1992 (NSW) (Mining Act), Work Health and Safety (Mines and Petroleum Sites) Act 2013 (NSW), Mine Subsidence Compensation Act 1961 (NSW), Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (EP&A Act), Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulations 2000 (NSW), Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW), Contaminated Land Management Act 1997 (NSW), Explosives Act 2003 (NSW), Water Management Act 2000 (NSW), Water Act 1912 (NSW), Radiation Control Act 1990 (NSW), Heritage Act 1977 (NSW), Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW), Crown Lands Management Act 2016 (NSW), Dangerous Goods (Road and Rail Transport) Act 2008 (NSW), Fisheries Management Act 1994 (NSW), Forestry Act 2012 (NSW), Native Title (New South Wales) Act 1994 (NSW), Roads Act 1993 (NSW) and National Parks & Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW). Under the EP&A Act, environmental planning instruments must be considered when approving a mining project development application. There are multiple State Environmental Planning Policies (SEPPs) relevant to coal projects in New South Wales. Amendments to the SEPPs that cover mining have occurred in the past two years and are aimed at protecting agriculture, water resources and critical industry clusters. One SEPP, referred to as the “Mining SEPP”, was amended in late 2013 to make it mandatory for decision makers to consider the economic significance of coal resources when determining a development application for a mine and to give primacy to that consideration. While this amendment was repealed in 2015, decision makers still have regard to the significance of a resource and the State and regional economic benefits of a proposed coal mine when considering a development application on the basis that it is an element of the “public interest” head of consideration contained in the legislation.
 
Mining Rehabilitation (Reclamation). Mine reclamation is regulated by state specific legislation. As a condition of approval for mining operations (and via PRCP and PRCP Schedule in Queensland as each mine is transitioned into this new arrangement over a 3 year period from November 1, 2019), companies are required to progressively rehabilitate mined land and provide security (or in Queensland, appropriate financial provisioning as determined by the Scheme Manager) to the relevant state government as a safeguard to cover the costs of rehabilitation in circumstances where mine operators are unable to do so. Self-bonding is not permitted. BFR has provided security to the relevant authorities which has been calculated in accordance with current regulatory requirements. BFR operate in both the Queensland and New South Wales state jurisdictions.
 
New South Wales reclamation. The Mining Act 1992 (NSW) is administered by the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment and authorizes the holder of a mining tenement to extract a mineral subject to obtaining consent under the EP&A and other auxiliary approvals and licenses.
 
Through the Mining Act, environmental protection and rehabilitation are regulated by conditions in all mining leases and environmental authorities including requirements for the submission of a Mining Operations Plan (MOP) prior to the commencement of operations. All mining operations must be carried out in accordance with the MOP which describes site activities and the progress toward environmental and rehabilitation outcomes and are updated on a regular basis or if mine plans change. The mines publicly report their reclamation performance on an annual basis.
 
In support of the MOP process, a rehabilitation cost estimate is calculated periodically to determine the amount of bond support required to cover the cost of rehabilitation based on extent of disturbance during the MOP period.
 
Queensland rehabilitation. The EP Act is administered by the Department of Environment and Science which authorizes environmentally relevant activities such as mining activities relating to a mining lease through an Environmental Authority (EA). Environmental protection is regulated by conditions in the EA. The mines submit an annual return reporting on their EA compliance . As a result of changes made to the EP Act which took effect on November 1, 2018 the holder of a site specific EA for a mining activity will now be required to prepare a ‘life of mine’ progressive rehabilitation and closure plan (PRCP) which will be binding in the undertaking of a mining activity and include annual reporting and regular auditing requirements in accordance with an approved PRCP Schedule. A PRCP is to include information detailing how mining activities will be undertaken to maximize progressive rehabilitation of the land to a stable condition. The PRCP Schedule will provide for specific rehabilitation milestones and non-compliance will be an offence.

Where a mine is operating pursuant to EA conditions about rehabilitation and an approved Plan of Operations ( which was previously required to describe site activities and the progress toward environmental and rehabilitation outcomes), those requirements will continue to apply until each mining operation is transitioned into the PRCP framework.
 
On April 1, 2019 changes to the financial provisioning requirements for undertaking a resource activity in Queensland took effect which has amended the way in which financial provisioning is calculated and provided. The new regime considers the risk profile of the EA holder for the resource (including mining) activity and the risk profile of the particular mining project so that security is either provided by way of a contribution to a fund or by other surety as determined by the Scheme Manager. From April 1, 2019 and over a three year period, the Scheme Manager will individually assess all current EAs (in an order as determined by the Scheme Manager) and transition those EAs into the new financial provisioning scheme.
 
Occupational Health and Safety. Broadly, State legislation requires persons conducting a business or undertaking to provide and maintain a safe workplace by providing safe systems of work, safety equipment and appropriate information, instruction, training and supervision. Specific occupational health and safety obligations have been mandated under state legislation to account for the specialized nature of the coal mining industry. The concepts are typically similar to the general occupational health and safety legislation however, there are some differences in the terminology, the application and detail of the laws. The most noteworthy difference being that coal mining safety laws are more prescriptive when compared to general occupational health and safety laws. Further, mining operators, executive officers (including directors and other officers of a corporate entity), employees with statutory appointments (e.g. site senior executives) and all other persons (including coal mine workers and all other persons at a mine) are subject to the obligations under this legislation.
 
A small number of coal mine workers in Queensland and New South Wales have been diagnosed with coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP, also known as black lung) following decades of assumed eradication of the disease. This led to a Parliamentary inquiry into CWP with a report tabled before the Queensland parliament in May 2017. The report made a series of recommendations regarding the detection and monitoring of CWP as well as recommending the relevant legislation better support these initiatives. The report also noted that the government authority (the Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy) responsible for regulating CWP (amongst broader occupational health and safety issues pertaining to the resources and mining sector) failed to properly administer the relevant legislation.
 
The Queensland Government released its formal response to the recommendations tabled before Parliament. Following the recommendations, and a consultation process, the Queensland Government made a number of changes to the coal mining legislation, specifically with a view to prevent and monitor issues contributing to CWP. Following the report, the Queensland Government’s initial response was to release a draft Bill establishing a mine health and safety regulatory body that is independent from the Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy. This Bill has not been passed by Parliament and further amendments to the Bill have been tabled.
 
From March 2019, new legislation has been in force which increases the maximum penalties that may be imposed following a successful prosecution. Following the introduction of the legislation, corporations may now be fined in excess of $AUD 4 million for breaching the coal mining legislation. Similarly, additional duties for contractors and service providers to coal mines have been introduced, as well as a positive obligation imposed on all officers of an entity to ensure that the officer conducts due diligence to assure itself that the entity is complying with its obligations under the legislation.
 
Industrial Relations. A national industrial relations system administered by the federal government applies to all private sector employers and employees. The matters regulated under the national system include employment conditions, unfair dismissal, enterprise bargaining, bullying claims, industrial action and resolution of workplace disputes. Many of the workers employed or to be employed by AFE and BFR are covered by enterprise agreements approved under the national system.
 
Greenhouse Gases. In 2007, a single, national reporting system relating to greenhouse gas emissions, energy use and energy production was introduced. The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth) (NGER Act) imposes requirements for corporations meeting a certain threshold to register and report greenhouse gas emissions and abatement actions, as well as energy production and consumption. The Clean Energy Regulator administers the NGER Act. The Commonwealth Department of Environment is responsible for NGER Act-related policy developments and review. Both foreign and local corporations that meet the prescribed carbon dioxide and energy production or consumption limits in Australia (Controlling Corporations) must comply with the NGER Act.
 
On July 1, 2016, amendments to the NGER Act implemented the Emission Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism. From that date, large designated facilities such as coal mines were issued with a baseline for their covered emissions and must take steps to keep their emissions below the baseline, comply with their statutory obligations by some other means (for example, by purchasing and surrendering Australian carbon credit units to offset emissions over the baseline) or face penalties.

Queensland Royalty. As a general rule, royalties are payable to the State of Queensland for extracted coal. Statutory formulas under the Mineral Resources Regulation 2013 (Qld) are used to calculate the royalty rates (expressed as a percentage) for coal sold, disposed of, or used, where the average price per metric ton is either between $100 and $150 Australian dollars, or greater than $150 Australian dollars. The rate is 7% for coal sold, disposed of, or used below $100 Australian dollars per metric ton. The periodic impact of these royalty rates is dependent upon the volume of metric tons produced at Queensland mining locations and coal prices received for those metric tons. The Queensland Office of State Revenue issues determinations setting out its interpretation of the laws that impose royalties and provide guidance on how royalty rates should be calculated.
 
New South Wales Royalty. In New South Wales, the royalty applicable to coal is charged as a percentage of the value of production (total revenue less allowable deductions). This is equal to 6.2% for deep underground mines (coal extracted at depths greater than 400 meters below ground surface), 7.2% for underground mines and 8.2% for open-cut mines.
 
Chinese Foreign Investment and Business Regulations
 
We operate our business in China under a legal regime consisting of the State Council, which is the highest authority of the executive branch of the Chinese central government, and several ministries and agencies under its authority, including the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”), the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) and their respective authorized local counterparts.
 
The Chinese government imposes restrictions on the convertibility of the Chinese Renminbi yuan and on the collection and use of foreign currency by Chinese entities. Under current regulations, the Chinese Renminbi yuan is generally convertible for current account transactions, which include dividend distributions, and the import and export of goods and services subject to review and approval by SAFE or its designated foreign exchange bank. However, conversion of Chinese Renminbi yuan into foreign currency and foreign currency into Chinese Renminbi yuan for capital account transactions is under the strict scrutiny of SAFE. According to SAFE Circular [2015] 19 (Circular on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement of Foreign-invested Enterprise) and SAFE Circular [2016] 16 (Circular on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement under the Capital Account), foreign-invested enterprise whose main business is investment may convert foreign currency in a capital account into Chinese Renminbi yuan for equity investment. Other types of foreign-invested enterprises may convert foreign currency in a capital account into Chinese Renminbi yuan for equity investment provided that the enterprise being invested into makes relevant registration with SAFE (or a designated bank) and establishes a settlement payment account.
 
Under current Chinese regulations, foreign-invested enterprises such as our Chinese subsidiaries are required to apply to banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business by SAFE for a Foreign Exchange Registration Certificate for Foreign-Invested Enterprise. With such registration (which is subject to remaining rights and interests, registration with SAFE), a foreign-invested enterprise may open foreign exchange bank accounts at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business by SAFE and may buy, sell and remit foreign exchange through such banks, subject to documentation and approval requirements. Foreign-invested enterprises are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account transactions and current account transactions. In addition, there are restrictions on the amount of foreign currency that foreign-invested enterprises may retain in such accounts, except that foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange income under current account transactions in its sole discretion.
 
Also, at the time of applying for SAFE registration (including any change registration), foreign-invested enterprises that do not constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to represent that its foreign shareholder is not directly or indirectly held by any Chinese residents; foreign-invested enterprises that constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to disclose the actual controlling person of its foreign shareholder. Any false or misleading representations may result in administrative liabilities imposed on the onshore entities and their legal representatives. If Chinese residents who are beneficial holders of our shares, make, or have previously made, direct or indirect round tripping investments through a SPV which falls within the scope of the registration under the SAFE Circular [2014] 37 (SAFE Circular [2014] 37 Relating to Foreign Exchange Administration of Offshore Investment, Financing and Round tripping Investment by Domestic Residents utilizing Special Purpose Vehicles), the Chinese residents must make foreign exchange registration for their offshore investments, failing which, the Chinese residents may be ordered to return the capital to China and be imposed a fine by SAFE for such misconduct.
 
Failure to comply with the registration procedures, including failure to update its own foreign exchange registration, may result in restrictions on the relevant onshore entity, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and restrictions on the capital inflow from the offshore entity, and may also subject relevant Chinese residents to penalties under the Chinese foreign exchange administration regulations. Also, at the time of applying for SAFE registration (including any change registration), the onshore entities that do not constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to represents that its foreign shareholder is not directly or indirectly held by any Chinese residents; the onshore entities that constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to disclose the actual controlling person of its foreign shareholder. Any false or misleading representations may result in administrative liabilities imposed on the onshore entities and their legal representatives.

Under Chinese regulations, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. The foreign invested company may not distribute profits until the losses of the previous fiscal years have been made up. Additionally, the foreign invested company shall make allocations of after-tax profits to a reserve fund and a bonus and welfare fund for their employees. In the case of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture, in addition to the reserve fund and the bonus and welfare fund, the company shall also make allocations to a venture expansion fund. In the case of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, the amount to be contributed to the reserve fund shall be no less than 10% of the after-tax profits unless the aggregate amount reaches 50% of the registered capital of the company, at which time the company may stop making allocations to the reserve fund. The amount to be contributed to other funds of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise or any of the above funds of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture may be determined by the board of the company in accordance with the applicable laws. Any amounts to be contributed to such funds shall be set aside prior to distribution of after-tax profit.
