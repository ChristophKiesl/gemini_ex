Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of functional calorie-burning fitness and lifestyle beverages under the Celsius® brand name. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving of Celsius® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s resting metabolism an average of 12% and providing sustained energy for up to a nine-hour period. Our exercise focused studies show Celsius delivers additional benefits when consumed prior to exercise. The studies show benefits such as increase in fat burn, increase in lean muscle mass and increased endurance.
 
We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks and sodas. Celsius® has no artificial preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. Celsius® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. The main Celsius line of products are sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda®, which makes our beverages low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted.
 
We currently offer five beverage lines, CELSIUS® Originals, CELSIUS HEAT™, CELSIUS® BCAA+ENERGY, CELSIUS® On-the-Go and CELSIUS® Sweetened with Stevia.
 
Celsius has undertaken significant marketing efforts aimed at building brand awareness, including a wide variety of marketing vehicles such as television, radio, digital, social media, sponsorships, and magazine advertising. We also undertake various promotions at the retail level such as coupons and other discounts in addition to in-store sampling. During the first quarter of 2021, Celsius launched a branded cooler program, with a first phase target of locating up to 1,000 coolers in various retail outlets.
 
We distribute our In the United States and elsewhere in North America, Celsius® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, spas, gyms, the military and e-commerce websites.
 
We distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR). We are continuing to emphasize DSD distribution as we believe it has been a key element in opening additional domestic markets and retail segments and increasing sales.
 
Our products are distributed in various foreign regions, primarily Europe and Asia, through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. Celsius intends to use Func Food as a platform to expand product distribution elsewhere in Europe.
 
The Company does not directly manufacture its beverages and powder packets, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to established third-party co-packers. We do, however, provide our co-packers with flavors, ingredient blends, cans and other raw materials for our beverages purchased by us from various suppliers.

Recent Developments 
 
On October 30, 2020, the Company fully repaid the outstanding bonds payable, which were reinstated as part of the acquisition of Func Food on October 25, 2019, in accordance with the original terms of the bonds. The total amount repaid was approximately $9.9 million, which included principal of $9.6 million and accrued interest of $0.3 million.
 
Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company’s Business
 
Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the global macro-economic environment which may also reflect the negative impacts caused by pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These macro-economic aspects may also impact inflation, currency exchange rates, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer demand, distribution and raw material costs.
 
Volatility in the financial markets and deterioration of global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in several ways, including the following:
 

● | Purchasing power of consumers may be reduced thereby affecting demand for our products; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Restrictions related to social distancing and other activities may limit the opportunity for our clients and consumers to purchase our products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a significant number of our employees are unable to work, including illness or travel restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations may be negatively impacted; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A shutdown of multiple co-packer facilities in connection with COVID-19 may affect our product availability; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Decreased demand for our products due to significant unemployment as a result of COVID-19 and macro-economic environment; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limitations regarding our raw materials and other input components could substantially impact the availability of our products; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If needed, it may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt, in each case, on terms and within a time period acceptable to us. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our ability to commercialize our products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related aspects or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our operations.
 
We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our supply chain, distribution and our consolidated results of operations. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply and has not experienced significant adverse effects on its business, operations and financial condition from such shortage or otherwise from the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have due to the uncertainties which include the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the intensity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, and/or actions that may be taken by governmental agencies.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on April 26, 2005 under the name “Vector Ventures, Inc.” and originally engaged in mineral exploration. Such business was unsuccessful. On January 26, 2007, we acquired the Celsius® beverage business of Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation engaged in the development of “functional” beverages since 2004 in a reverse merger, and subsequently changed our name to Celsius Holdings, Inc.

Our Products
 
Celsius® calorie-burning beverages were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005.
 
According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of Celsius® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of Celsius® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise.
 
We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. Celsius® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. Celsius® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. Celsius is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda®, which makes our beverages low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of Celsius® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse.
 
We currently five beverage lines:
 

● | CELSIUS® Originals, our initial product line. is currently offered in nine flavors: orange, wild berry, cola, grape, kiwi-guava and watermelon (which are carbonated), and non-carbonated green tea raspberry/acai, green tea/peach mango and green tea/grapefruit melon. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CELSIUS HEAT™, introduced in 2018 is a trainer’s grade beverage. CELSIUS HEAT™ is also a dietary supplement, that uses the same proprietary thermogenic MetaPlus® formula as CELSIUS®, Originals, which is proven to accelerate metabolism, boost energy and accelerate calorie and fat burn when combined with exercise. CELSIUS HEAT™, which is packed with 2,000mg of L-citrulline and 300mg of caffeine, comes in eight carbonated flavors: Apple Jack’d, Orangesicle, Inferno Punch, Cherry Lime, Blueberry Pomegranate, Strawberry Dragonfruit, Tangerine Grapefruit and Jackfruit.

Celsius® ready-to drink products are packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold as singles or in four-packs. We have recently redesigned our packaging to provide a cleaner, crisper and more modern look. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to -drink products line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free.
 
As a result of completion of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we acquired the beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods marketed and distributed in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These products are distributed under the FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and which are owned by Func Food. FAST products is a market leader in Finland and has begun distribution into the Swedish market. FitFarm and CocoVi are well-established brands of superfoods and other supplements in the Nordic countries.

Clinical Studies
 
It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more beverages are marketed with health claims. Celsius® was one of the first functional beverages to be launched along with a clinical study. Celsius® is also one of very few functional beverages that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some beverage companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important to have studies on the actual product.
 
We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for Celsius®. Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total Celsius® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided Celsius® beverage for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal shareholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies.
 
The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com. The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of Celsius® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12 ounce serving of Celsius® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke®. All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank Celsius® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis.
 
Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy.
 
The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of Celsius® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming Celsius® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo beverage and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant.
 
The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the Celsius® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis.
 
Our fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined Celsius® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of Celsius® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion.

Our fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or Celsius®, per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels.
 
Our sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or Celsius®, per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO2 were observed in the subjects that consumed Celsius® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects.
 
Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as the ready to drink beverages.
 
Manufacture and Supply of Our Products
 
Our beverages are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. We believe one benefit of using co-packers is that we do not have to invest in the production facility and can focus our resources on brand development, sales and marketing. It also allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of Celsius® products is specified as 15 to 18 months.
 
Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in Celsius® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. Celsius® is labeled with a supplements facts panel. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. We single-source all our ingredients for purchasing efficiency; however, we have identified a second source for our critical ingredients and there are many suppliers of flavors, colorings and sucralose. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers that may disrupt our production schedules.
 
Packaging materials, except for our distinctive sleek aluminum cans, are easily available from multiple sources in the United States; however, due to efficiencies we utilize single source vendor relationships. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply and has not experienced significant adverse effects from such shortages.
 
We believe that our co-packing arrangement and supply sources are adequate for our present needs.
 
Func Food similarly has its FAST and other products manufactured by independent third parties in the Nordic countries.
 
Distribution
 
Domestic
 
In the United States and elsewhere in North America, Celsius® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, spas, gyms, the military, and e-commerce websites.

5
-

 

We distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR).
 
We are continuing to emphasize the expansion of our DSD distribution network as we believe it has been a key element in opening additional domestic markets and retail segments and increasing sales.
 
We also sell our products online through our own and other e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. As a result of the shift to online purchasing by consumers, including additional growth arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the shutdown of various retail outlets, particularly gyms and health clubs in the fitness channel, e-commerce sales have accounted for a growing percentage of our domestic revenue. We expect this trend to continue at least through most of 2021.
 
International  
 
We distribute our products in various foreign regions through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. Celsius intends to use Func Food as a platform to expand product distribution elsewhere in Europe.
 
We market our products in the Asian market, which is one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing, through a partnership with A.S. Watson industries in Hong Kong and a license agreement with our partner in China, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Qifeng”). While we initially began both local production and preliminary distribution of the Celsius® brand in 2018 through our partnership in Qifeng, effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our Celsius products (i.e., license agreement) and a repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of $6.9 million for the five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng Food will repay the marketing investments made by Celsius into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated.
 
Significant Customer
 
As a result of the growth of our business and the increase in online sales in 2020 related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, one customer, Amazon, accounted for approximately 15% and 12.0% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that we are dependent on our sales to Amazon for our continued growth and profitability.
Seasonality of Sales 
 
As is typical in the beverage industry, sales of our beverages are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets.
Competition
 
We believe that our Celsius® brand products are one of the few calorie-burning fitness beverages whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position in the beverage market. However, our products do compete broadly with all categories of consumer beverages. The beverage market is highly competitive, and includes international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional beverage market include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Monster Energy, and Red Bull.
Proprietary Rights
 
We have registered the Celsius® and MetaPlus® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks.
 
We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus® formulation and product formulas.

6
-

 

We maintain our MetaPlus® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula.
 
We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future.
 
As a result of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we have acquired additional brands and tradenames.
 
Government Regulation
 
The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.

7
-

 

Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.
 
Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold.
