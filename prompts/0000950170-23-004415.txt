Item 1. Business
 The Company is a self-administered and self-managed real estate company that acquires, owns and manages self-storage properties. We refer to the self-storage properties in which we have an ownership interest, lease, and/or are managed by us as “Properties.” We began operations on June 26, 1995. We were formed to continue the business of our predecessor company, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1985. At December 31, 2022, we had an ownership interest in and/or managed 1,198 self-storage properties in 37 states and the District of Columbia. Among our 1,198 self-storage properties are 141 properties that we manage for unconsolidated joint ventures, 299 properties that we manage and have no ownership interest, and five properties that we lease. We believe we are the fourth largest operator of self-storage properties in the United States based on square feet owned and managed. Our Properties in the United States conduct business under the customer-friendly name Life Storage ®.
At December 31, 2022, the Parent Company owned a direct or indirect interest in 899 of the Properties through the Operating Partnership, which includes 758 wholly-owned properties and 141 properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. In total, we own a 97.9% economic interest in the Operating Partnership and unaffiliated third parties collectively own a 2.1% limited partnership interest at December 31, 2022, assuming the conversion of all preferred operating partnership units at that date. We believe that this structure, commonly known as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust (“UPREIT”), facilitates our ability to acquire properties by using units of the Operating Partnership as currency. By utilizing interests in the Operating Partnership as currency in self-storage facility acquisitions, we may partially defer the seller’s income tax liability which in turn may allow us to obtain more favorable pricing.
 The Parent Company was incorporated on April 19, 1995 under Maryland law. The Operating Partnership was formed on June 1, 1995 as a Delaware limited partnership and has engaged in virtually all aspects of the self-storage business, including the development, acquisition, management, ownership and operation of self-storage facilities. Our principal executive offices are located at 6467 Main Street, Williamsville, New York 14221, our telephone number is (716) 633-1850, and our website is www.lifestorage.com.
 We seek to enhance shareholder value through internal growth, acquisition of additional storage properties, expansion and enhancement of existing self-storage properties, expansion of our third-party management platform, select new development, and advances in innovative technology. Internal growth is achieved through aggressive property management: optimizing rental rates, increasing occupancy levels, controlling costs, maximizing collections, and strategically expanding and enhancing the Properties. Should demographic and economic conditions warrant, we may develop new properties. We believe that there continues to be opportunity for growth through acquisitions, including acquisitions through unconsolidated joint ventures of the Company. We seek to acquire self-storage properties that are susceptible to realization of increased economies of scale and improved performance through application of our expertise.
 Industry Overview
 We believe that self-storage facilities offer affordable storage space to residential and commercial users. In addition to fully enclosed and secure storage space, many facilities also offer outside storage for automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats. Modern facilities, such as those owned and/or managed by the Company, are usually fenced and well lit with automated access systems and surveillance cameras and offer temperature and humidity control features. Our customers rent space on a month-to-month basis and typically have access to their storage space up to 15 hours a day, with 24-hour access in certain circumstances. Individual storage spaces are secured by the customer’s lock, and the customer has control of access to the space.
 According to the 2023 Self-Storage Almanac, of the estimated 51,000 core self-storage facilities in the United States (those properties identified as having self-storage operated as the core business at the address), approximately 24.2% are owned and/or managed by the 10 largest operators. This results in a highly fragmented industry as the remainder of the industry is characterized by numerous small, local operators. The scarcity of capital available to small operators for acquisitions and expansions, internet marketing, call centers, and the potential for savings through economies of scale are factors that are leading to consolidation in the industry. We believe that, as a result of this trend, significant growth opportunities exist for operators with proven management systems and sufficient capital resources to grow through acquisitions and/or third-party management platforms.
 Property Management
 We have over 35 years of experience acquiring, building, expanding and managing self-storage facilities, and the combined experience of our key personnel makes us one of the leaders in the industry. Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value at acceptable levels of risk. To support our long-term growth, we employ the following strategies with respect to our property management:
Our People:
 We recognize the importance of quality people to the success of an organization. Accordingly, we hire and train to ensure that associates can reach their full potential. We conduct annual anonymous surveys of all employees to proactively identify areas for improvement. We strive to ensure that all associates conduct themselves in accordance with our core values: Teamwork, Respect, Accountability, Integrity, and Innovation. In turn, we support them with state-of-the-art training tools including an online learning management system, a company intranet and a network of certified training personnel. Every store team also has frequent, and sometimes daily, interaction with an Area Manager, a Regional Vice President, an Accounting Representative, and other support personnel. As such, our store associates are held to high standards for customer service, store appearance, financial performance, and overall operations.
Training & Development:
 Our employees benefit from a wide array of training and development opportunities. New store employees undergo a comprehensive, proprietary training program designed to drive sales and operational results while ensuring the delivery of quality customer service. To supplement their initial training, employees enjoy continuing edification, coaching, and performance feedback, including customer satisfaction surveying, throughout their tenure.
 All learning and development activities are facilitated through our online training and development portal. This portal delivers and tracks hundreds of computer-based training and compliance courses; it also administers tests, surveys, and the employee appraisal process. The Company’s training and development program encompasses the tools and support we deem essential to the success of our employees and business.
 Marketing and Advertising:
 The digital age has changed consumer behavior – the way people shop, their expectations, and the way we communicate with them. As such, we utilize the following strategies to market our properties and products:
 •We created, developed and implemented Rent Now, our proprietary fully-digital rental platform for customers who prefer to self-serve and complete the rental process online. Customers can now “skip the counter” by selecting a storage unit, completing the rental agreement and making their rental payment online. The customer receives their property access code and step-by-step directions to their specific rental unit on a digital map sent to their mobile device. Rent Now is fully-integrated with Life Storage’s operating, security and revenue management systems, allowing for real-time and efficient inventory and sales management.
 •We employ a Customer Care Center (call center) that services an average of 56,000 rental related inquiries per month. Our Sales Representatives answer incoming sales calls for all of our locations, 364 days a year, 24 hours a day. In addition, they respond to email inquiries and serve as overnight customer service agents to assist customers outside of regular office hours. The team undergoes continuous training and coaching in effective storage sales techniques and best practices in customer service, which we believe results in higher conversions of inquiries to rentals.
 •We maintain a website and involve internal and external expertise to manage our internet presence and leverage a search engine and social media marketing strategy to attract customers and gain rentals online, through our call center and at our stores. Precise targeting and tracking through campaign management and analysis allows us to attract the right customers, at the right time, for reasonable costs of acquisition.
 •Since demand for storage is largely based on timing, the goal is to create positive brand recognition through a variety of channels, both digital and traditional. When the time comes for a customer to select a storage company, we want the Life Storage brand to be recognized as the most trusted and respected provider. We employ a variety of different strategies to create brand awareness; this includes our branded merchandise such as moving and packing supplies, regional marketing in the communities in which we operate, and digital targeting using search, social media and remarketing campaigns. We strive to introduce storage solutions early and often to gain the most exposure as possible for the longest duration.
 •Approximately 59.7% of our self-storage space is comprised of units with temperature and/or humidity control capabilities which we market to corporate, retail and residential customers seeking storage solutions for valuable, sentimental, or otherwise sensitive items.

Third-Party Management:
 We seek to add third-party managed stores to our portfolio in order to help drive fee revenue, brand awareness, cost efficiencies and customer data to make more informed revenue management decisions with little capital investment. The portfolio also may, in certain circumstances, serve to supplement our acquisition pipeline.
 To broaden opportunities available, we have implemented a bridge lending program, under which an unconsolidated joint venture of the Company provides financing to properties that we will manage. We anticipate that this program will help us increase our management business, create additional future acquisition opportunities, and strengthen our relationship with partners, all while providing interest and fee income. This joint venture generally originates mortgage loans and mezzanine loans, with the intent to sell the mortgage loans to third parties, while retaining the joint venture's interests in these loans.
Corporate Customer Value Proposition:
 We offer a differentiated corporate customer value proposition through Warehouse Anywhere. Warehouse Anywhere is Life Storage’s proprietary intelligent and technologically advanced warehousing solution that provides third-party logistics (3PL) through a forward deployed, unmanned model combining storage asset management with a proprietary inventory management application across a network of more than 12,000 Life Storage or partner facilities.
Ancillary Income:
 We know that our over 690,000 customers require more than just a storage space. Knowing this, we offer a wide range of other products and services that fulfill their needs while providing us with ancillary income. We rent moving dollies and blankets, in addition to carrying a wide assortment of moving and packing supplies including boxes, tape, locks, and other essential items. For those customers who do not carry storage insurance, we make available renters insurance on which we earn income by providing reinsurance through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. We also receive incidental income from billboards and cell towers.
Information Systems:
 Each of our primary business functions is linked to our customized computer applications, many of which are proprietary. These systems provide for consistent, timely and accurate flow of information throughout our critical platforms:
 •Our proprietary operating software (“LifeOS”) is installed at all locations and performs the functions necessary for field personnel to efficiently and effectively run a property. This includes customer account management, automatic imposition of late fees, move-in and move-out analysis, generation of essential legal notices, and marketing reports to aid in regional marketing efforts. Financial reports are automatically transmitted to our Corporate Offices overnight to allow for strict accounting oversight.
 •LifeOS is linked with each of our primary sales channels (customer care center, internet, store) allowing for real-time access to space type and inventory, pricing, promotions, and other pertinent store information. This robust flow of information facilitates our commitment to capturing prospective customers from all channels.
 •LifeOS provides our revenue management team with raw data on historical pricing, move-in and move-out activity, specials and occupancies, etc. This data is utilized in the various algorithms that form the foundation of our revenue management program. Changes to pricing and specials are “pushed out” to all sales channels instantaneously.
 •LifeOS generates financial reports for each property that provide our accounting and audit departments with the necessary oversight of transactions; this allows us to maintain proper control of cash receipts.
Revenue Management:
 Our proprietary revenue management system is constantly evolving through the efforts of our dedicated data science and revenue management team. We have the ability to change pricing instantaneously for any single unit type, at any single location, based on the occupancy, competition, and forecasted changes in demand. By analyzing current customer rent tenures, we can implement rental rate increases at optimal times to increase revenues. Advanced pricing analytics enable us to reduce the amount of concessions, attracting a more stable customer base and discouraging short-term price shoppers. This system continues to drive revenue stability and/or growth throughout our portfolio.
Property Maintenance:
 We take great pride in the appearance and structural integrity of our Properties. All of our Properties go through a thorough annual inspection performed by experienced project managers. These inspections provide the basis for short and long term planned projects that are all performed under a standardized set of specifications. Routine maintenance such as landscaping, pest control, and snowplowing is contracted to local providers to whom we clearly communicate our standards. Further, our software tracks repairs, monitors contractor performance and measures the useful life of assets. As with many other aspects of our Company, our size has allowed us to enjoy relatively low maintenance
costs because we have the benefit of economies of scale in purchasing, travel, and overhead absorption. In addition, we continually look to green alternatives and implement energy saving alternatives as new technology becomes available. This includes the installation of solar panels, LED lighting, energy efficient air conditioning units, and cool roofs which are all environmentally friendly solutions that have the potential to reduce energy consumption (thereby reducing costs) in the buildings in which they are installed. We continue to implement and expand the Company’s solar panel initiative which has reduced energy consumption and costs at those installed locations.
Environmental Social Governance:
 Our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Committee supports our on-going commitment to sustainability by identifying, evaluating and monitoring ESG issues throughout the Company and overseeing the integration of strategic ESG initiatives throughout the organization. On-going initiatives can be found within our annual Sustainability Report located on our website at https://www.lifestorage.com/company/sustainability/.
Environmental and Other Regulations
 We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property. We have not received notice from any governmental authority or private party of any material environmental noncompliance, claim, or liability in connection with any of the Properties, and are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the Properties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
 The Properties are also generally subject to the same types of local regulations governing other real property, including zoning ordinances. We believe that the Properties are in substantial compliance with all such regulations.
 Insurance
 Each of the Properties is covered by fire and property insurance (including comprehensive liability and business interruption), and all-risk property insurance policies, which are provided by reputable companies and on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, we maintain a policy insuring against environmental liabilities resulting from tenant storage on terms customary for the industry, and title insurance insuring fee title to the Company-owned Properties in an amount that we believe to be adequate.
Federal Income Tax
 We operate, and we intend to continue to operate, in such a manner as to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be taxed, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders. We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries. In general, our taxable REIT subsidiaries may perform additional services for customers and generally may engage in certain real estate or non-real estate related business. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - REIT Qualification and Distribution Requirements.”
Competition
 The primary factors upon which competition in the self-storage industry is based are location, appearance, rental rates, suitability of the property’s design to prospective customers’ needs, and how the property is operated and marketed. We believe we compete successfully on these factors. The extent of competition depends significantly on local market conditions. We seek to locate where we can increase market share while not adversely affecting any of our existing locations in that market. However, the number of self-storage facilities in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the performance of any of the Properties.
 Several of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. These larger operators may, among other possible advantages, be capable of greater leverage and the payment of higher prices for acquisitions. However, we believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions.
 Investment Policy
 While we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may, at our discretion, invest in mortgage and other real estate interests related to self-storage properties in a manner consistent with our qualification as a REIT. We may also retain a purchase money mortgage for a portion of the sale price in connection with the disposition of Properties from time to time. Should investment opportunities become available, we may look to acquire additional self-storage properties via new or existing joint-venture partnerships or similar entities. We may or may not elect to have a significant investment in such a venture, but would use such an opportunity to expand our portfolio of branded and managed properties. We also invest in innovative, and sometimes proprietary, new technology that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.

Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.
 Disposition Policy
 Any disposition decision of our Properties is based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, (i) the potential to continue to increase cash flow and value, (ii) the sale price, (iii) the strategic fit with the rest of our portfolio, (iv) the potential for, or existence of, environmental or regulatory issues, (v) alternative uses of capital, and (vi) maintaining qualification as a REIT.
 The Company did not sell any self-storage facilities in 2022, 2021, or 2020. During 2022, one of the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures sold one self-storage facility, which was acquired by the Company. During 2021, the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures sold a total of four self-storage facilities, all of which were acquired by the Company. During 2020, the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures sold a total of 36 self-storage facilities, 32 of which were acquired by the Company.
 Distribution Policy
 We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our shareholders. However, future distributions by us will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not include capital gains or losses). Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distribution in order to meet the minimum requirements.
Financing Policy
 Our Board of Directors currently limits the amount of debt that may be incurred by us to less than 50% of the sum of the market value of our issued and outstanding common and preferred stock plus our debt. We, however, may from time to time re-evaluate and modify our borrowing policy considering current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of properties, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors. In addition to our Board of Directors’ debt limits, our most restrictive debt covenants limit our leverage. However, we believe cash flow from operations, access to the capital markets and access to our credit facility, as described below, are adequate to execute our current business plan and remain in compliance with our debt covenants.
 The following sets forth certain financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022:
 On July 13, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit facility. Under the amended credit facility, the Company's revolving credit facility increased to $1.25 billion and the maturity date of such facility was extended to January 13, 2027. The new revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable annual rate equal to Term SOFR plus a 0.10% SOFR adjustment plus a margin based on the Company's credit rating (the margin was 0.775% at December 31, 2022) and requires an annual facility fee on the revolving credit facility which varies based on the Company’s credit rating (the facility fee was 0.15% at December 31, 2022). The interest rate on the Company’s revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022 was approximately 5.20%. At December 31, 2022, there was $654.9 million available on the unsecured line of credit. The Company has the option under this credit facility to increase the total aggregate borrowing capacity to $2.0 billion.
 Amounts outstanding on the Company’s line of credit at December 31, 2022 totaled $595.0 million.
 During 2022, the Company issued 1,352,833 shares of common stock under the Company’s continuous equity offering programs at a weighted average issue price of $135.22, generating net proceeds of $180.8 million.
 To the extent that we desire to obtain additional capital to pay distributions, to provide working capital, to pay existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions, expansions or development of new properties, we may utilize amounts available under our line of credit, common or preferred stock offerings, floating or fixed rate debt financing, retention of cash flow (subject to satisfying our distribution requirements under the REIT rules) or a combination of these methods. Additional debt financing may also be obtained through mortgages on our Properties, which may be recourse, non-recourse, or cross-collateralized and may contain cross-default provisions. We have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single Property or on our portfolio as a whole, although certain of our existing term loans contain limits on overall mortgage indebtedness. For additional information regarding borrowings and equity activities, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Notes 5, 6 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements filed herewith.
Employees
 At December 31, 2022, we employ a total of 2,508 employees, including 1,052 property managers, 70 area managers, and 979 associate managers and part-time employees. At our headquarters, in addition to our three senior executive officers, we employ 404 people engaged in various support activities, including accounting, human resources, customer care, and management information systems. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be excellent.
