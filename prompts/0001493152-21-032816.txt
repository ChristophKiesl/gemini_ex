ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2017 as a wholly owned subsidiary of RealBiz Media Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“RealBiz”). On July 31, 2018, RealBiz effectuated our spin-off from RealBiz. Upon completion of the spin-off, RealBiz stockholders owned 100% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.
The Company
 
We are engaged in the business of providing digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry. We currently generate revenue from service fees (video creation and production and referral fees from our LoseTheAgent.com website). At the core of our programs is our proprietary video creation technology which allows for an automated conversion of data (text, video slices and pictures of home listings) to a video with voice over and music. We provide video search, storage and marketing capabilities on multiple platform dynamics for web and mobile. Once a home, personal or community video is created using our proprietary technology, it can be published to social media, email or distributed to multiple real estate websites.
 
In addition, we own and operate the web site LoseTheAgent.com, which is a site dedicated to peer-to-peer real estate transactions between home sellers and buyers - the so called For Sale By Owner segment. We currently have approximately 100,000 home listings across all 50 states. LoseTheAgent.com website traffic increased 105% in users and 114% in page views over the 11 months ending November 30, 2021, compared to the same period ending November 30, 2020. After adjusting for the discontinuance of advertising and marketing expenditures in February 2020, LoseTheAgent.com website traffic almost tripled in users and more than doubled in page views (176% in users and 147% in page views) over the 9 months ending November 30, 2021, compared to the same period ending November 30, 2020 (periods during which we spent $0 on LoseTheAgent.com advertising and marketing). We monetize the website by charging fees for both listing a home for sale and picking up possible buyers’ messages of interest. We also plan on generating additional revenues by monetizing seller/buyer data with targeted, interested parties. The web site is fully functional and is being marketed via various online platforms.

Products and Services
 
We currently offer the following products and services:
 
Enterprise Video Production: We service large and small broker accounts in the North America Real Estate Market in compiling listings into a Video format and distributing to those franchisor’s websites, brokers and agents and lead generation platforms 24/7. Some of these multiyear contracts produced over 10 million video listings from 2012-2014. These volumes, however, have declined beginning in 2017. We currently have the ability to produce over 15,000 videos per day.
 
The Virtual Tour (VT): This program was developed and implemented to allow agents to access specific video based product strategies that are designed specifically to increase the SEO rank and traffic credit to real estate franchise systems and/or their brokers.
 
LoseTheAgent.com: We own and operate the web site LoseTheAgent.com, which is a site dedicated to peer-to-peer real estate transactions between home sellers and buyers - the so called For Sale By Owner (FSBO) segment. We currently have approximately 100,000 home listings across all 50 states. We monetize the website by charging fees for both listing a home for sale and picking up possible buyers’ messages of interest. We also plan on generating additional revenues by monetizing seller/buyer data with targeted, interested parties. The web site is functional and is being marketed via various online platforms.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Key Elements of our growth strategy during fiscal 2021 include:
 
Focus on growing the number of home listings on LoseTheAgent.com. While we have experienced growth in the number of listings of FSBO homes, we plan to continue to seek interested home buyers via targeted Internet and social media platforms. In addition, we believe a public relations campaign could boost awareness of our brand and increase listings volume.
 
Leverage our proprietary video technology. While our proprietary video technology has been developed for the real estate industry, we believe this technology can be applied to other industries as well. In particular, we believe that the used car sale industry could benefit from our automated and seamless development engine. We will continue to explore these and other similar opportunities.
 
Design and develop technology for the real estate industry. We will continue working to develop technologies to increase sales and efficiencies for the real estate professional.

Background and Industry Trends
 
According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR) data, for sale by owner (FSBO) transactions represented over 7% of all home sales in the United States in 2021. While NAR considers private sales between people familiar to each other, such as family members, as FSBO home sales, we believe this percentage is still impressive. In the Year 2022, trends are expected to expand the FSBO segment as technology replaces the search/find capabilities of the MLS and property owners seeking to save on commissions take on additional roles typically carried out by real estate agents.
 
We believe that the real estate market is undergoing a dramatic change not dissimilar to that previously experienced by traditional stock brokerages. We believe that the most critical aspect driving this change is the advent of the Internet as a tool for searching for and researching real estate, eliminating the commitments of time and expense involved with visiting multiple properties in person. According to the National Association of Realtors’ 2014 “Member Profile,” 89% of home buyers use the internet to search for a home, up from 74% in 2010. This mirrors the 69% who use a realtor for their search. Note: many buyers use both the internet and a realtor in their search. In addition, home sellers can use the Internet to check home valuations, track the housing market and research comparable sales information. The majority of consumers used the Internet frequently to search for homes (81%), with consumers aged 33 or younger being higher than average (92%) and 59-67 year olds below (although still high at 69%). Searches are often conducted on mobile devices such as iPhones (47%), iPads (40%) or Androids (24%). One of the most significant trends for our business is that 70% of homebuyers search for and watch video home tours. Also, real estate searches on Google have grown 253% over the past four years.
 
The increased use of technology throughout the entire process of a typical residential real estate transaction is an important development in the real estate market. For instance, electronic communication and electronic data storage permits a real estate brokerage to quickly reproduce standard real estate transaction documents, store such documents and store other important information about customers and properties, and communicate quickly with other parties involved in real estate transactions (e.g., title companies, insurers, surveyors, inspectors and governmental agencies), all of which permits increased efficiencies in the process of buying and selling a home. The technological changes and developments generally make it possible to achieve a greater volume of transactions with less effort and expense.
 
We believe the technological developments in the real estate market and the increased amount of information available to and used by ordinary consumers appear to be circumstances that are similar to those developments that eventually gave rise to the non-traditional stock brokerages which have intruded upon the market dominance of traditional stock brokerages over the past two decades. For example, we note that the non-traditional stock brokerages developed their services and products to compete primarily on the bases of price, consumer effort and technology. Their websites, such as TD Ameritrade or e-Trade, provide not only trading capacity for the average consumer, but also a tremendous amount of information about companies. In this regard, we note that there has recently been a proliferation of various Internet-related real estate businesses that seek to provide either specific and limited services or information relating to residential real estate transactions (e.g., ForSaleByOwner.com, BuyOwner.com, Realtor.com, Trulia.com and Zillow.com). Like the non-traditional stock brokerages, these businesses typically rely on consumer effort, technology and price as the bases for competition.

However, the market models of Zillow/Trulia and Realtor are now in direct conflict with the enterprises that own the listings and that make the actual sales. The Zillow group’s main revenues are generated by advertising the listing as though another agent owned the listing, an agent that had paid Zillow for such display. Unaware, the consumer thus interacts with the displayed agent thinking they are the one that controls the listing. Then the display agent contacts the true agent and askes to 50/50 split the commission due on the sale. As the consumer power of the Zillow group has grown exponentially, they have substantially cut into the profits of the enterprises and agents that actually own the listings. Thus, the battle lines are now drawn between the Zillow group and groups such as Realogy member of companies and Keller Williams.
 
We foresee direct and continuous pushback in 2022 by the enterprises against the Zillow group, in trying to neutralize their marketing power and take ownership back of their listings. As publicly owned companies the Zillow group can only grow revenues by increasing advertising rates to the agent community which strikes deep into agent discontent with the enterprises and the resulting demand in action. This competitive model is unique to the real estate industry and clearly will not follow the path of the aforementioned financial portals.
 
Website and Mobile Applications
 
Our product, LoseTheAgent.com, is a complex web site produced completely by our internal technology group. We believe our technology team has utilized the latest technologies in order to make LoseTheAgent easy to use and functionally convenient. Visitors are able to search our thousands of listings, gain critical information about properties, and after making an informed choice, directly contact owners of target properties. After making contact with an owner, a dialog commences between the two parties that may result in a potentially advantageous sale for both parties. Our use of map data increases site usability where visitors can search using state, city or even neighborhood.
 
We are utilizing our proprietary technology along with our industry contracts to create two separate and very important critical paths for real estate professionals and their organizations to follow. By using our video processing capabilities combined with micro-site and website building techniques we have created an agent/broker micro-site product that leverages best practices in SEO (search engine optimization) on the agent/brokers behalf and delivers a web and mobile friendly rich media experience to consumers. This solution provides the broker a significant increase in organic ranking in local searches, increased site traffic and by doing so, reduces the agent/broker dependency on traditional listing aggregators. Secondly, by integrating marketing capabilities into a single powerful platform, we have taken the direct-to-agent sales model and offered to the property owner through SoloSeller, our proprietary marketing toolset. This strategy lowers risk threshold by giving home sellers a set of tools to market their homes on social media and the Internet as well as providing a pathway to developing accelerating revenue stream via a monthly subscription model. While the former video generator intensive model for us will continue to be our primary revenue generator, we believe that our SoloSeller will become the next generation of marketing for the FSBO home seller.
 
LoseTheAgent saw growth in traffic, audience and revue in 2021. While the real estate market was reeling from COVID, we experienced growth. For the 9 months ending November 2021, page views and users were up more than double (+114% for page views and + 105% for users) and revenues were up more than 40%. Interestingly, according to NAR only 4% of FSBO sellers utilized videos of their homes in the sale process. This represents an opportunity for us as video is a key element of the virtual search/tour paradigm. We hope to expand marketing efforts to reach the thousands of listing owners on the web site, encouraging them to utilize our proprietary video technology for a minimal fee.

Market and Competition
 
The FSBO segment represents 7% of home sale transactions according to NAR 2020 projections; however, the segment remains nascent. We believe the advent of Internet based technology has made much of the practical functionality reserved to real estate professionals irrelevant. Even so, there doesn’t appear to be a market leader focusing solely on the FSBO segment, likely because of challenges related to monetization of FSBO market opportunities. While Zillow has expanded the category dramatically by introducing a listing process for interested FSBO sellers, this runs against the revenue interest of Zillow and may potentially adversely impact agents that are the mainstay of Zillow revenues. Other players such as forsalebyowner.com and fsbo.com have been around for decades but have not had the financing to fuel market expansion and growth. As a result, we believe the existing competition in the FSBO market does not preclude us from achieving success in this market. We believe the key is to develop a formula for monetization so that the few web sites in the FSBO segment can fuel the category expansion the market is demanding.
 
The National Association of Realtors has approximately 1.2 million members, of which we estimate roughly half are active and associated with at least one real estate brokerage firm.
 
Presently, Zillow is the largest independent real estate market site, as measured by homes in its database and unique visitors to its website. In 2015, Zillow completed its acquisition of Trulia making it the single most powerful name in the real estate web marketplace. A full 29% of web property searches were conducted on the joint platforms in 2015. As part of the industry consolidation, NewsCorp acquired the 3rd largest real estate portal, Realtor.com. This acquisition has fueled the growth in Realtor.com both via relevance and traffic making it now the second most popular real estate directory site, after Zillow. Additionally, there are a variety of other websites which have meaningful market share and listing information. We believe a battle for the consumer mindset is now underway as the real estate enterprises enter into a competitive setting against Zillow/Trulia/Realtor/Homes. We also believe we can benefit from the acrimony as we have positioned ourselves as the friends of the enterprises and offer products and capabilities that will enhance the position of the enterprises by leveraging our technology.
 
Customers
 
We have experienced substantial customer losses in our legacy RealBiz 360 video businesses due to our proprietary Virtual Tour technology being overtaken by open-source coding and clients taking the service in house and offering as an added benefit to agents, free of charge. As a result, for the year ended November 30, 2021, our legacy business revenue was down 24%.
Industry Segments
 
We currently operate in one primary operating segment, real estate, mainly through web-assisted services.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
The residential real estate market has traditionally experienced seasonality, with a peak in the spring and summer seasons and a decrease in activity during the fall and winter seasons. Revenues in each quarter can be significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter, given the time lag between contract execution and closing. A typical real estate transaction has a 30-day lag between contract signing and closing of the transaction.
 
Impact of COVID
 
The pandemic introduced wide disparity and unpredictable fluctuations in the US real estate market. Residents seeking to escape the confines of large and crowded cities drove down real prices in urban areas, introducing countervailing unnatural pricing spikes in certain more rural destinations. These forces combined to make accurate forward real estate pricing almost impossible. In the FSBO segment the necessity to introduce strangers to view homes became a disease transmission risk for many older home owners. Activity in urban areas flattened as owners refused to sell into a depressed market, in popular rural areas however the exact opposite happened as owners were offered prices hereto unimaginable. This negatively impacted the FSBO segment. We anticipate robust growth in home sales, particularly in urban areas, as COVID comes under control.
