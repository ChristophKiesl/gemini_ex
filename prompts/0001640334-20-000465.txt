Item 1. Business
Overview

Union Bridge Holdings Limited (the “Company” or “we”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 6, 2014 under the name Costo, Inc. to engage in the business of distributing automobile parts and components necessary for the maintenance and repair of automobiles and specialty equipment, including construction and road machinery, principally in China, Europe and certain Commonwealth of Independent States countries (Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). We changed our name to Union Bridge Holdings Limited on May 23, 2016 in connection with our expanded business plan under which we determined to expand operations into the health care industry. We never achieved any revenues from our automobile and specialty equipment business and during the fourth quarter of 2017 we determined to discontinue that area of business.

The Company incorporated a new wholly owned subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, First Channel Limited (“FC”), on March 18, 2016. This subsidiary was formed for investment holding.

The Company incorporated two new wholly owned subsidiaries in the British Virgin Islands: 1.) Phoenix Creation Global Limited (“PC”) on October 26, 2017 and 2.) Windsor Honour Limited (“WH”) on October 30, 2017, respectively. These subsidiaries were formed with the intent to sell healthcare products and services to seniors and individual with disabilities. The Company procured samples of motorized wheelchairs, as the first product in an expected of a portfolio of products targeted at this market.

On February 2, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary Union Beam Investment Limited (“UB”) established Qianhai Lianqiao Investment Consulting (Shenzhen) Company Limited, renamed as Union Beam Trading (Shenzhen) Limited (“UB Trading”), a wholly foreign owned entity in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), to engage in the sale of healthcare products and services. On November 6, 2019, the Company disposed UB Trading to an unrelated party at no consideration.

On February 13, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary PC established Union Care Investment Limited (“UC”) in Hong Kong engaging the senior care services.

On May 25, 2018, our subsidiary, Union Care Investment Limited in Hong Kong (“UC”) established Sino Silver (Qianhai) Holdings Ltd. (“Sino Silver Qianhai”), a wholly owned entity in the PRC, to engage in the provision of elderly home care services, to establish senior care centers and to provide community services. On November 6, 2019, the Company disposed Sino Silver Qianhai to an unrelated party at no consideration. 

On September 20, 2018, Sino Silver Qianhai and UB established Sino Sliver (Beijing) Elderly Service Ltd. (“Sino Silver Beijing”) in the PRC to engaging elderly home care services, operate senior care centers and provide community services in the Beijing region. Due to the disposal of Sino Silver Qianhai and UB Trading to an unrelated party in November 6, 2019, Sino Silver Beijing is no longer the Company’s subsidiary.

On December 27, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary UC established Sino Silver (Zhuhai Hengqin) Elderly Service Limited “(Sino Silver Zhuhai”), a wholly owned entity in the PRC engaging the elderly home care services, senior care centers and community services. On December 17, 2019, the Company disposed Sino Silver Zhuhai to an unrelated party.

Restructuring

On September 24, 2019, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), with shareholders of Conperin Group Inc., a British Virgin Islands company, who together own shares constituting 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares Shares of Conperin Group Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the shareholders of Conperin Group Inc. transferred to us all of their shares of Conperin Group Inc. in exchange for the issuance of 187,546,887 shares of our common stock (the “Stock Purchase”). As a result of the Stock Purchase, we are now a holding company, is engaged in providing technology in digital media industry, including developing a branded social network and e-commerce app platform aiming to promote a high quality of life for families and seniors by using artificial intelligence, blockchain and cognitive e-commerce technology in China, Hong Kong and Asia Pacific. As a result of the consummation of the Stock Purchase, we are no longer a shell company as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

We develop and operate CircleYY, a mobile-based social networking and premium e-commerce app and website platform that will also use impactful editorial content to promote a balanced quality of life for families and seniors aged 50 and above by understanding their behavior, tastes and needs. The platform enables users around the world to share family stories, build meaningful interactions between 50+ users and their family members, discover and buy fashion, beauty and other daily accessories products. We connect people and facilitate human interactions based on cities, interests and a variety of activities including pictures and short videos.

Our CircleYY mobile application can be downloaded and used free of charge, and we will generate our revenues from the various services we offer on our platforms, dedicated to a 50+ client base and their families: (i) collaborations with brands and users on the creation of premium content (ii) the sale of advertising on our social media platform (iii) the sale of third-party branded items, mainly fashion, beauty, daily accessories and services on our e-commerce platform.

As a global platform, CircleYY is expected to target a global audience with content designed for universal appeal amongst family members, notably 50+, along with a local focus for marketing campaigns. The initial opening market is intended to be Hong Kong SAR, followed by similar markets in the Asia-Pacific area and subsequently Europe and North America.

On September 27, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary Conperin Group Inc. established Circle YY International Inc., a limited company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“Circle International”), to engage in new business when any suitable business opportunity arises. As of December 31, 2019, Circle International is ready to be engaged in the business activities of the Company.

On November 11, 2019, our subsidiary Circle YY Technologies Hong Kong Limited, which operates our CircleYY platforms, launched its unique ecosystem technology covering social networking, content and e-commerce. 

Material Commitments

Chang Mai Project

On March 23, 2018, our subsidiary, Windsor Honour Limited (“WHL”) entered into a Binding Heads of Agreement with the owner of a land parcel for a senior care facility to be established in Chang Mai, Thailand. The parties will negotiate in good faith toward definitive agreements regarding the project. WHL would lease the land and be the developer of the project and would own the buildings on the site. WHL would have full control of the design and supervision of the construction of the project, as well as daily operations and management of the project. The land owner would be responsible for obtaining necessary construction, operation and other permits for the project and would provide necessary liaison with government officials. Total investment in the project for development and construction is estimated to be approximately 200 million Thai Baht (approximately US$6.4 million at current exchange rates), for which WHL would be responsible to obtain financing. WHL would also be responsible for arranging financing of operating costs until they can be funded from operations. The project would lease the land for 90 years with automatic renewals, each for 30 years. The total rent for the first 90 years would be 10 million Thai Baht (approximately US$320,000 at current exchange rates). In addition to the rent, WHL may consider a discretionary bonus to the land owner (with details to be agreed in the definitive agreements).

Upon signing the definitive agreement, WHL will pay 2 million Thai Baht (approximately US$64,300 at current exchange rates) as a deposit to the land owner within 90 days, which will be refundable if the development plan for the land as a senior nursing home facility has not been approved by the competent government authority within one year, or if before that date such authority has definitively denied the application for the development plan upon the request of WHL. Otherwise, the deposit will be applied to the rent for the land.

No assurance can be given, however, that the Chang Mai, Thailand senior facility project will be successfully developed and operated because, (i) WHL may not successfully negotiate definitive agreements for the project, (ii) required permits may not be obtained, and (iii) required financing may not be obtainable.

Industry and Market Overview

The pace of population ageing around the world is growing faster than at any time in the past. According to the World Health Organization, the proportion of the world’s population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22% between 2015 and 2050. A longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole. Additional years provide the chance to pursue new activities such as further education, a new career or pursuing a long- neglected passion. Older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities. Yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on two factors: their health and their quality of life.

According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department (report no.67, June 2019), between 2016 and 2018, smartphone users aged over 65 increased by 35%. 95% of internet users aged over 65 used the internet for online social activities. Retirees spent an average of 7.1 hours per week for online social activities and this number is increasing. There is still a strong margin of progression for e-commerce use: only 37% of the aged 45-54 population bought online in the last 12 months, so did 18.4% of the aged 55-64 population and 2.8% of the aged over 65 population. This means there are already 325,100 online shoppers in the 50+ group: the total catchment audience in Hong Kong SAR of adult users is around 1.2 million users.

Corporate Structure

Our current corporate structure is set forth below:

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following key competitive strengths:


● | First-mover advantages and strong brand recognition. There are plenty of social networks and e-commerce platforms but we believe that CircleYY will be the first to combine these two components along with a consistent theme, that of building a family lifestyle with positive values and empowering the 50+ population. Combined with a brand that boldly showcases the company values, this delivers a clear first mover advantage that we expect to quickly provide strong brand recognition amongst the target audience.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have designed and developed our app and website with a sleek and user-friendly interface, which can support visitors and branded products for sale on our e-commerce platform. Simplicity and accessibility are extremely important factors given our target user audience, which includes people aged above 50+ who will appreciate ease of use.

To that effect, an entertaining loyalty system based on gamification processes and interaction between users has been put into place to reward and incentivize repeat users.

Our Initial Target End Users and Acquisition

Our user target group is comprised of families and users aged 50 and above, both active and retired. We expect that these user groups will be a major target of our editorial content which will aim to create a new market standard in terms of a healthy, positive quality of life for 50+ users and stimulate them to stay active, whilst staying connected to current trends. Users will also be encouraged to post content on the social media feed and share their expertise in certain fields (business, crafts, cooking, hiking, travel experiences etc) in order to inspire others whilst becoming key opinion leaders (KOLs).
Growth Strategy

Our objectives are to build and consolidate our position as one of the most innovative social networking and e-commerce platforms and to achieve rapid but sustainable growth. We intend to achieve these objectives by implementing the following strategies, although there is no guarantee that our growth plan will be successful:

Internationally expanding our e-commerce platform

We intend to expand our platform in order to facilitate penetration into different markets and build a global brand. To achieve this goal, we intend to further customize our digital media platform to cater for visitors from different parts of the world with different language preference. After launching with an initial marketing strategy based around Hong Kong SAR, we will expand to other regional cities with sizeable English language speaking demographics, such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Manilla, and countries before targeting other global destinations, notably Europe and North America.

Increasing CircleYY branded products

We intend to add new CircleYY branded products, notably in the technology and lifestyle fields, in order to create a strong brand image and provide accessible items that will be ideal gifts to 50+ users. 

Enhancing the fun and interactive loyalty program

We intend to add new features to our loyalty program in order to attract more users, notably via a gamification process.

Promoting our CircleYY Brand name to attract a wider customer base and increase consumer loyalty

Enhancing our brand name in the industry will allow us to solidify and broaden our customer base by growing market awareness of our products. We intend to seek partnerships with well-known premium fashion and lifestyle brands for the e-commerce component, which we believe will help position CircleYY as the ideal platform when it comes to purchasing gifts for and showing appreciation to 50+ users.

Collaborating with leading Non-Governmental Orgnizations to promote common values and corporate social responsibilities.

CircleYY promotes positive values such as an improved quality of life for 50+ people, bringing together families irrespective of generations and distance and generally positive change in the mindset of society. As such its values are aligned with several global non-governmental organisations and campaigns, such as the Junior Chamber International or the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CircleYY intends to seek partnerships with like-minded corporations

Our CircleYY App Platform

The CircleYY platform, aiming at revolutionizing intergenerational relationships by becoming the first family focused vertical social network platform, includes the CircleYY mobile application and a variety of related properties, features, functionalities, tools and services that we intend to provide to users, customers and platform partners. The CircleYY mobile application, which is available on Android and iOS platforms, enables users to share family stories, build meaningful interactions between seniors and their family members, discover and buy fashion, beauty and other daily lifestyle products and services. We connect people and facilitate interactions based on location, interests and a variety of activities including pictures and short videos. CircleYY offers a personal and lively way for users of all ages to get to know their family members better and enables 50+ users to meet like-minded people. It facilitates connecting, communicating, interacting, and content sharing with others. CircleYY features various social networking features, including uploading functions, pictures and short video services, hobby groups, a private family network and other live interactive experiences. CircleYY’s social features are increasingly integrated with video and audio functions to offer more fun and entertaining contents and to enhance and encourage social interactions between users. On December 2019, CircleYY launched its website (www.circleyy.com) and the CircleYY mobile application expects to be launched around mid-2020.

Key features and functionalities offered by the CircleYY mobile platform include the following:

Follow functions

The Follow tab aggregates content that a user chooses to follow and video content our algorithm “thinks” the user might want to follow based on our data analytics. There are two subsections within the tab. The “Follow” section under the Follow tab contains a stream of feeds created by people followed by the user while the “Recommended” section features popular short video content that our recommendation engine, based on our data analytics, believes the user might like or suggests the user to follow. The algorithm of the recommendation engine computes and makes recommendations based on a variety of factors including users’ personal preferences as well as the overall popularity of a specific short video clip.

Family and group functions

Our application allows users to create and/or participate in family groups and social groups created across points of interest. Each group is given a shared CircleYY discussion page on which group members can discuss their common interests, post their photos, exchange messages and organize other online and offline events. Individuals can connect with each other regarding common interests.

User Profile Page

If a user is interested in finding out more about another user on our platform, he or she can review the User Profile page, which is a function that we offer to provide a quick snapshot of a user. Information featured on this page includes profile pictures, account status such as activeness, popularity, the user’s historical posts and videos shared as well as the broadcasters.
Our Website - CircleYY.com

Our website CircleYY.com has been launched in December 2019 which provides a platform for the publication of news and articles that update our followers and visitors about the latest lifestyle trends for 50+ users, notably with articles or videos about fashion, footwear, entertainment, music, lifestyle, technology and design. We expect to bring to our followers and visitors the latest trends in fashion, lifestyle, culture and music, that interest our senior users and their family member followers and visitors. Our content is updated on a continuous basis. It will also have similar family network, e-commerce and social network functions to the mobile app.

Our CircleYY Store

CircleYY caters to consumers’ ever-growing demand for high-quality products and premium shopping experience. We have positioned CircleYY as a trusted platform for senior consumers and their family members. CircleYY is intended to be the partner of choice for brands. Brands and retailers are expected to operate their own flagship stores on the CircleYY platform with unique brand identities and look and feel, accompanied by full control over their own branding and merchandising. We seek to build our mind-share among consumers to position CircleYY as the premier shopping destination for premium items, highlighting value and convenience for senior people and their families. We plan to strengthen consumer recognition of CircleYY’s value proposition in consumer products through promotional events and strategic partnerships.
Our Digital Content

As an operator of social networking and e-commerce platforms, we view content management and monitoring as a critical part of our operations. We monitor and screen user information and user generated content against a spam list, which is a list of content and behaviors that we have determined are likely to be indicative of inappropriate or illegal content or illegal activities. Additionally, our users can also easily report fraud if they come across suspicious content, and each user complaint is processed by our content management and monitoring system.

Our editorial teams follow the latest trends in fashion, lifestyle, culture and music and gather information from various sources. Our editors select and present news and events which appeal to families and people of 50+ through our editorial experience and knowledge in the fashion and digital media industries. When appropriate, our editors also seek to verify information gathered by conducting independent research or interviews with third-parties. Through our rigorous curation and review process, our editors seek to report and produce digital content such as articles and videos that are most relevant and interesting to our audience. We utilise data analytics to track the popularity of articles such that our editorial teams are able to choose better content that is suitable for different user groups according to their preferences.

Our Services and Products

We currently generate revenues primarily from value-added service, mobile marketing services, and other services.

Value-added Service

Our value-added service primarily consists of subscription services that provide paying users with features and functions for better user-friendly experience on CircleYY. We provide enhanced membership privileges to CircleYY users who subscribe to our membership package by paying membership fees.
Mobile Marketing Services

We seek to provide advertising and marketing solutions to enable our customers to promote their brands and conduct effective marketing activities. We provide our customers with analytical tools to enable them to track and improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns on our platform. Our advertising and marketing customers include brand marketers, local merchants, application developers and publishers as well as other small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. Our mobile marketing services currently include the following:

In-feed marketing solutions.

We offer advertising units that appear as feeds on the CircleYY social platform features. We offer advertising units in various formats, including text-based content, pictures, video clips and function that enables direct application downloads.

Our customers can use a combination of the various formats and targeting capabilities to create their marketing campaigns more effectively.

Display ads.

We offer a variety of marketing products in display format, including full screen banner ads that appear before the application is loaded, banners on frequently visited pages and other sponsored images displayed elsewhere within our application. Unlike the in-feed ad units, the display ad units are not sold through the bidding system.


9


We also offer integrated marketing packages that include multiple advertising units such as feeds, banners, video ads and sponsorships in order to serve a broader sets of marketing objectives of our marketing customers.

Loyalty Program

We believe that it is important to ensure that users join the app but also return afterwards. To that effect, an entertaining loyalty system based on gamification processes and interaction between users has been put into place to reward and incentivize repeat users.
Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) Services

CircleYY will encourage 50+ users to post videos and other forms of content to the social network in order to boost their lifestyle and share their expertise. To this effect, they will be empowered to become Key Opinion Leaders for the platform and share the values of CircleYY to other users in their age group.
Orange Label Solutions (OLS) 

CircleYY offers users new opportunity to grow brand awareness and global expansion to local and international business. We select brands which we believe are aligned with our values. Selected brands will be offered service packages starting from Gold, Platinum to Orange Label Solutions (“OLS”). Our first OLS service package, charged on a fixed monthly fee basis, will include 10 SKUs products and model photo shooting, online sales, fulfillment and professional reports. The CircleYY fulfillment offers users fully customizable experience and enables us to control our inventory and warehouse operations. 

For Business to Business, OLS provides a one stop service fulfillment to vendors which features lower operation costs, inventory storage space and cost, centralized returns policies and management. With OLS tags, OLS promotes merchants’ brand value. For Business to Customers, OLS creates prestige and unique brand image value and desirable first impression. While we ensure OLS service quality, we provide special box design for easy use and returns. 

Other Services

Our other services will include subscriptions to gifting programs for other family members, business gift sales for companies who want to add a special touch for their regular customers and online to offline events that are produced with partner brands. Our other services also includes model photo shooting. We are planning to establish Studio O, a state-of-the-art photography studio, which will also provide for space for multipurpose, including warehouse and fulfillment operations. 

Sales and marketing

Digital Media Services

We have a sales and marketing team responsible for sales and marketing activities for the promotion of our digital media services.

Our brand and our CircleYY platforms act as a marketing tool for our company. We continuously post updates on fashion, lifestyle, culture and music on our platforms. Many of our digital media customers learn about us through our platforms.

Members of our sales and marketing team maintain regular contacts with our existing media customers to understand their marketing needs and keep them updated on our advertising products and services. For potential advertising customers, we inform them of our recent developments and achievements by distributing project portfolios and background materials. Our sales and marketing team also attends events organised by brands to broaden the team’s network and provide coverage of these events on our digital media platforms. We constantly look for and identify synergies among various digital publications, social media platforms and apps and devise impactful cross advertising opportunities.


10

E-commerce Business

Our e-commerce segment primarily engages in the operation of CircleYY store that primarily sells third-party branded clothing, shoes and daily accessories to our customers. We believe that a considerable portion of our e-commerce customers are also followers and visitors to our digital media platforms. The rest of our customers are obtained through our other marketing efforts which include search results returned from search engines and advertisements we place on other websites and on our digital media platforms.
Research and Development

Our research and development efforts focus on product development, architecture and technological infrastructures, as well as the security and integrity of our platform to protect our user data.

Our product development endeavors revolve around continuous innovations to help users discover and make new connections as well as building effective interactions. As our user base continues to expand and consumer behaviors constantly evolve, the social demands from the users become increasingly diversified. We make significant investments in technology to optimize our existing products and services and to develop new ones so that we can expand the social use offerings to satisfy the diversifying user demands.

In addition, we are also investing in building and maintaining the technological infrastructures to support the delivery and usage of our products and services in a fast and efficient manner within a safe and secured environment.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We are in the process of registering 37 trademarks in 12 countries. The source codes and the design architecture are wholly owned by CircleYY. We have also registered 13 domain names, including CircleYY.com.
Competition

As a mobile social networking and e-commerce platform, we are subject to intense competition from providers of similar services, as well as potential new types of online services.

Our competitors may have substantially more cash, traffic, technical, performer and other resources, as well as broader product or service offerings and can leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain a larger share of marketing budgets from customers. We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors, including composition and engagement of our user base, our ad targeting capabilities, market acceptance of our mobile marketing services, our marketing and selling efforts, and the strength and reputation of our brand. We also experience significant competition for highly skilled personnel, including management, engineers, designers and product managers. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our existing personnel and add additional highly skilled employees.

Insurance

We do not maintain property insurance, business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain key-man life insurance.

Legal Proceedings

We are currently not a party to any legal or administrative proceedings and are not aware of any pending or threatened legal or administrative proceedings against us in all material aspects. We may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
● | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.


We may take advantage of these provisions through December 31, 2020. If certain events occur prior to December 31, 2020, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to December 31, 2020.

We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this registration statement and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies.
