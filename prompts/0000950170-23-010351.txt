Overview
 GreenLight has a clear mission: To create products addressing some of humanity’s greatest challenges through the rigorous application of science.
 We aim to achieve this goal through our cell-free biomanufacturing platform. This platform enables us to make complex biological molecules—nucleic acids, peptides, carbohydrates, and many others—in a manner that we believe will allow us to manufacture high-quality products at a lower cost than traditional methods using fermentation. We are using this platform to develop and commercialize products that, if they receive appropriate regulatory approvals, address agricultural, human health and animal health issues.
Humanity faces numerous challenges. There are more than eight billion people sharing the diminishing resources of Earth. This growing population needs to produce more food with the same amount of land and, at the same time, honor the global desire—and increasing technical need—to replace chemical pesticides. Not only are these pesticides facing increased consumer opposition and threat of outright bans due to environmental damage, but many are losing their effectiveness.
More than half the world’s population now lives in cities, breathing the same air that carries pathogens and causes infections. Humanity needs to adapt and tackle pandemics both for those who have and for those who do not have access to good health care around the planet.
To address these issues, we need to develop high-quality, cost-effective products that can be deployed widely, including to developing countries. We believe ribonucleic acid, or RNA, can be the critical aspect to these products.
 RNA gained broad global prominence in recent years as the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the world’s population, prompting messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines to move from a scientific theory to a medical reality. Vaccines made using mRNA proved among the fastest to develop and the easiest to update for newer strains of COVID-19.
While the fast rollout of mRNA vaccines helped change the course of the pandemic, this is just one part of the story. The full potential for RNA in human health has not yet been realized. Beyond human health, RNA-based technology can also be deployed to address other global issues, including agricultural needs for crop protection.
Our technology platform, which was initially developed to produce agricultural crop protection products and is protected by patents and know-how, is capable of synthesizing building blocks (nucleotides), building tools (enzymes), and instructions (DNA templates) to make double-stranded RNA, or dsRNA, within an integrated process. The know-how that we gained from our experience with designing and developing our dsRNA platform process and analytics provided the foundation upon which we designed and developed our mRNA production process and analytics. For more information on our proprietary platform, see “Business—Our Manufacturing Platform and Capabilities.”
We have several dsRNA-based products in our agricultural pipeline that, if commercialized, we believe can change the way in which farmers protect crops, allowing them to better utilize the land dedicated to agriculture and produce foods with less or no pesticide residue. Two of these potential products, CalanthaTM, which is designed to manage Colorado potato beetles, and our varroa mite solution, which is designed to protect bees, have been submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval. Our other dsRNA-based agricultural products are in various earlier stages of development, ranging from proof of concept in the lab to proof of technology in the greenhouse and proof of scale in the field. See “Business—Plant Health Product Pipeline” for additional information on the development process. In order to commercialize a product for the U.S. agricultural market, we must complete specified toxicology and environmental studies, submit a registration dossier to the EPA demonstrating that the product does not pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment, respond adequately to any deficiencies

identified by the EPA through its risk assessment process and obtain the EPA’s approval of our labeling. The EPA must also establish a tolerance level for the product or issue a tolerance exemption. We must separately obtain any applicable state or foreign regulatory approvals where we want to commercialize our products. For more information regarding the regulatory process, see “Business—Government Regulation—Agricultural Products” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Plant Health Program”.
Our COVID-19 vaccine program and shingles vaccine program are the primary focus areas of our human health pipeline. Other potential product candidates in our human health pipeline are in early stages of pre-clinical research and development. To get to the pre-investigational new drug (“IND”) application phase for our product candidates in our human health pipeline, we must successfully design and test the product candidates in animal models, achieve positive results, select the product candidates to progress to IND-enabling toxicology studies, develop chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) protocols and create a development plan to discuss with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other foreign health regulatory authorities, as applicable, as part of pre-consultations, and manufacture, fill and finish the vaccine candidate material. Significant uncertainty exists as to whether any of other potential product candidates will reach the candidate selection phase.
AN INTRODUCTION TO RNA
RNA is present in all known life forms and plays an essential role in numerous biological processes, including the control of gene expression through RNA interference (RNAi) and as a messenger for protein synthesis. Consequently, RNA molecules are being studied for use in potential products in many fields, such as agriculture (e.g., dsRNA-based insecticides or fungicides) and human health (e.g., mRNA-based vaccines and therapies).

RNA can be transformative for human health and plant health:
•Plant health—where dsRNA can be leveraged to regulate the expression of a target protein by interfering with its message. Such RNA-mediated interference can form the basis for highly targeted pesticides or protection against parasites. 
 •Human health—where mRNA can be used to express specific proteins which form the basis of vaccines as well as other therapies. 
 
RNA in agriculture
New crop-protection strategies are urgently needed as pests become resistant to existing pesticide products. Many existing products are also being limited through primary regulatory action (government regulations) or secondary regulations (food chain regulation) because of concerns about their effects on humans or the environment, with environmental concerns including off-target toxicity and long-term effects on crops, soil, and water. Together, these factors spur the need to develop alternative crop-protection products with new modes of action and improved safety profiles.
Double-stranded RNA products in agriculture exploit a natural biological process called RNA interference (RNAi). This is a biological process found in many eukaryotic organisms, which break down dsRNA that has been taken into a cell into short fragments known as small interfering RNA (siRNA). The presence of these small RNA fragments can lead to the degradation of complementary mRNA, thereby limiting or stopping the synthesis of the protein that is encoded by the mRNA (e.g., a protein that is of vital importance to a harmful pest insect).
RNA-based pesticides may be able to give us more environmentally friendly ways to protect crops and beneficial insects while effectively stopping harmful pests. Much of our ability to design products that are intended to improve the environmental profile associated with crop protection products relies on our ability to design an RNA sequence that is only found in the organism(s) that we desire to manage. In this design process, we will compare the genome of our target species to the genome of other species that may co-exist with it, including humans, with the goal of avoiding off-target effects.

RNA in human health
Messenger RNA’s features make it broadly valuable for potential use in human health, whether as a prophylactic vaccine or a therapy. It is well known that mRNA has been used to make some of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines and that these vaccines have been developed quickly, which is critical for a pandemic response. Far more than a billion doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine have already been produced globally. We are developing multiple mRNA vaccine candidates such as shingles vaccine candidates, an improved vaccine designed to be more broadly protective against COVID-19, and personalized oncology vaccines.
DNA encodes the instructions for life to function. DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is processed and translated by the ribosome as it synthesizes proteins. Instructions to make proteins that perform many critical functions are transcribed from the

DNA to mRNA. mRNA is a polymer generally comprised of four ribonucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil), the sequence of which determines the composition of the protein that the mRNA encodes. Synthetic mRNA can be produced in manufacturing facilities for delivery into the cellular cytoplasm, enabling the cells to produce proteins as vaccines or for therapy.
mRNA has many useful attributes:
•Wide range of applications: mRNA can encode for any protein (intracellular, membrane-bound, or secreted), giving it many potential uses (e.g., as a component of vaccines or therapies). 
 •Transient expression: The body has mechanisms to degrade mRNA, allowing for repeat dosing and a dose-response which can be tailored for the needs of the pharmaceutical product. 
 •Fast development: Relatively simple changes to the mRNA molecule are needed to produce different therapeutic proteins, enabling a fast turnaround from gene selection to product. For instance, if a booster vaccine is needed for a new variant, no changes will need to be made except to the mRNA sequence itself. 
 •Flexible manufacturing: A single manufacturing facility can produce different vaccines and therapies with appropriate controls in place, as the process of producing the mRNA is essentially the same regardless of the product will little need for major manufacturing changes.
 Until recent years, it was very difficult to stabilize mRNA, understand its interaction with the human immune system and avoid innate immune activation, or deliver it into target cells at effective levels. Addressing these challenges has allowed the development of the RNA industry and its rapid deployment as a global healthcare product.
OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH STRATEGY
 
As a company, we aim to make the benefits of RNA, and other biologics, accessible to everyone.
In human health, we are developing vaccines and RNA therapeutics to alleviate or cure critical diseases facing patients worldwide. In agriculture, we are developing products that promote sustainability and supplement or replace traditional pesticides and fungicides with RNA in farmers’ crop-protection and enhancement programs.
Our technology platform provides for integrated discovery, design, and development of RNA-based products and gives rise to three distinct capabilities that underpin a sustainable business model and bring capabilities normally used in advanced pharma discovery to agriculture and human health:
•Identification and design: Machine learning and proprietary algorithms are key tools as we work to identify the best gene target candidates for dsRNA-based products and seek to design safe and effective dsRNA against those targets. For mRNA-based products in human health, we identify the protein that we are seeking to have the patient express (e.g., an antigen for a prophylactic vaccine application) and seek to design safe and effective mRNA according to our design rules. As we accumulate data across our programs throughout their various stages of development, we incorporate learnings for future improvements to our design and discovery processes. 
 •Develop and optimize: Our ability to produce RNA and formulate it in-house fuels development. Depending on the testing needs of the program and the stage of development, we can produce various RNAs (types, compositions, lengths) at different scales (ranging from micrograms to kilograms) and various levels of purity with fast turnaround. For instance, we might screen dozens to several hundreds of RNAs in early discovery using microgram to milligram quantities that can be produced and analyzed in one week. As lead sequences are identified, we may seek to improve them by further iterating on their designs. In addition, as the leads progress further in development, we will produce them at the milligram to gram scale (e.g., for in vivo animal studies with mRNA in human health or for greenhouse trials with dsRNA in agriculture). We also have kilogram-scale capability for dsRNA (e.g., for supplying global field trials). 
 •Manufacturing: We have developed two manufacturing processes, one for plant health (dsRNA) and one for human health (mRNA) that both rely on synthesis of RNA from RNA building blocks, enzymes, and DNA templates and require many of the same analytical methods for assessing in-process control and product quality. We can produce dsRNA products through our proprietary cell-free system. Our current production scale is 2,000 liters per batch. Our mRNA process has been used to produce clinical trial material under phase-appropriate current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations for use in human trials. Our mRNA process has been demonstrated at commercial scale (i.e., basis of 50-liter mRNA synthesis reaction) at a contract development and manufacturing organization. See “Business – Our Manufacturing Platform and Capabilities” for additional details.


In the next five years, our pipeline includes seven agricultural products planned for launch and several human health product candidates with clinical milestones, including Phase I clinical trials, in each case, subject to applicable regulatory approvals.
We anticipate this pipeline will demonstrate:
•Fast development of agricultural products. CalanthaTM will, if approved in 2023, have taken five years from first field trials to market compared to a typical 10-year cycle at major agribusinesses. 
 •Rapid integration of acquisitions. We acquired Bayer’s topical RNA treatment for honeybees that targets the varroa mite in December 2020. By May 2021, we were conducting further field trials. In February 2023, we submitted our dossier for this product to the EPA for review. 
 •Validation of our mRNA platform. We are working toward clinical proof of concept of our COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidate. We have updated our clinical strategy to leapfrog monovalent and bivalent vaccines and advance to progressing our pan-sarbecovirus mRNA vaccine candidate. 
 Our growth strategy in plant health is to pursue significant market opportunities where RNA has the greatest potential to provide growers with improved pest control and the sustainable nature of our products (e.g., benefits to honeybees and low to no residue) delivers the most impact for society and aligns most closely with macro trends from consumers and regulators. When we use the term ‘sustainable,’ we refer to our efforts to align economic development with environmental protection and human well-being as well as our anticipated obligations as a Public Benefit Corporation under § 362(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
For our plant health products, we define total addressable market as the global revenue opportunity available to pesticide solutions controlling a target pest or disease. In most instances, we do this by defining a relevant active ingredient market for the crop or crops where we intend to market our products and then making an assumption as to the percentage of that market that is spent on controlling the target pest or disease. We use data from AgBioinvestor and FAOSTAT (a database run by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), and data purchased from third party consultants is used to quantify the market and underpin assumptions. In order to address the total insecticide and fungicide markets we identify pests or diseases in that market, develop targeted dsRNA sequences for them and attempt to develop the best delivery mechanism for that dsRNA. Over time, we intend to expand beyond RNA, building on our capabilities. In human health, we intend to pursue markets where RNA can provide better products (faster, cost effective or more efficacious) to improve standards of care for patients across infectious diseases, oncology/autoimmune products, and in a variety of additional indications through potential third party collaborations.

 OUR MANUFACTURING PLATFORM AND CAPABILITIES
 Our platform, developed through years of research and technology development, is protected by know-how and foundational patents.
 Overview of manufacturing process for agriculture
 While the potential advantages of dsRNA for use in agriculture have been known for some time, production cost has historically been a barrier. Our proprietary cell-free dsRNA manufacturing process was designed to achieve an economically viable scale (i.e., metric tons per annum) and cost of goods for competing in broadacre agriculture markets (e.g., < $1 per gram of dsRNA technical grade active ingredient). In human health, raw materials from the vaccines industry are not readily available at these scales and at economically viable prices. Cell-based processes (e.g., production of RNA via microbial fermentation) are generally low yielding and of poorer quality, necessitating more expensive larger-scale capital than higher yielding, higher quality cell-free processes.
Our proprietary process begins with cellular RNA obtained from inexpensive, readily available sources (e.g., yeast). This cellular RNA is broken up (depolymerized) into RNA building blocks (nucleoside monophosphates) using a nuclease enzyme. The desired dsRNA is then synthesized from these nucleoside monophosphates using carefully selected enzymes that “energize” the building blocks (into nucleoside triphosphates) and polymerize them into the desired RNA according to a corresponding DNA template. Key to this dsRNA synthesis process and its economic viability is that we employ inorganic polyphosphate as the energy source, which is inexpensive and readily available like the nucleotide source (cellular RNA). We also produce the required enzymes and DNA templates via scalable fermentation-based processes using proprietary microbial strains, all of which were developed at GreenLight with scale and cost in mind. In addition, enzymes that have a high temperature tolerance were selected to facilitate the production of high-energy nucleotides. The utilization of such enzymes allows high temperature to be incorporated in their preparation, providing a way to mitigate undesirable contaminating activities (e.g., RNA-degrading enzymes, DNA-degrading enzymes, nucleotide-degrading/altering enzymes, protein-degrading enzymes) from entering the RNA synthesis portion of the process and affecting quality and yield.
 Regarding the scalability of our cell-free manufacturing platform, we have increased our production scale of dsRNA from microliters to our current 2,000-liter capacity with no material impact on quality or process yields. Regarding the flexibility of the platform, we have synthesized numerous dsRNAs of varying lengths and compositions across these scales in order to supply material for testing at all stages of product development from early discovery to greenhouse to field trials. We believe our expertise and proprietary technology will allow us to increase batch sizes to 10,000 liters and beyond, which will allow us to reduce the cost of our dsRNA products.

Our manufacturing for agriculture
Our dsRNA manufacturing facility in Rochester, New York, is designed for process development while generating samples for research and market development with a design basis of 1,000 kg of dsRNA production per year. The facility has a raw material storage and handling area, high bay wet-processing area with floor drains, two 1,200-liter fermenters, two 2,000-liter cell-free reactors, NMP preparation tanks, formulation, packaging, development laboratory, analytical laboratory, loading dock, and cold storage areas. This plant currently has 18 process engineers, technicians, research associates, and quality-control personnel for commercial production of plant health products.
Of our two 2,000-liter reactors, one has been operational since the second quarter of 2021, and we are planning to have the other online by the end of the second quarter of 2023 as part of our plan to increase manufacturing capacity to 1,000 kg of dsRNA per year. If we obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals to commercialize our products as we project in our agricultural product pipeline, we expect that this capacity will enable us to meet our agricultural product needs through mid-2024.

Overview of manufacturing process for human health
Messenger RNA is produced using a state-of-the art process. mRNA is synthesized (via an in vitro transcription reaction) from RNA building blocks (nucleoside triphosphates and a co-transcriptional capping reagent) that are assembled by an enzyme (RNA polymerase) according to a set of molecular instructions (DNA template) that encodes for the desired mRNA. The resulting mRNA is comprised of elements (a 5’-untranslated region, a protein-coding region, a 3’-unstranslated region, and a poly(A) tail) that ultimately enable protein expression (e.g., of an antigen for a prophylactic vaccine application) upon delivery to human cells. The mRNA undergoes several purification steps to reach the highest quality levels for safety. This process scales linearly from milliliter-scale to commercially relevant scale (50 liters), achieving 12 grams of mRNA per liter of reaction.


For our most advanced programs, the purified mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to facilitate delivery to target cells in humans. The LNPs protect the mRNA from degradation and enables its uptake into the cells so that the mRNA can be used to express the protein of interest. The manufacturing process for mRNA-LNP involves two liquid streams colliding at high velocity in a jet-mixing chamber, one of which contains lipids and one of which contains mRNA. After some additional processing, a cryoprotectant is added before the product is sterile-filtered and stored prior to fill-finish.

Our manufacturing for human health
 In June 2022, we terminated our lease for cleanrooms in Burlington, Massachusetts. In May 2022, we entered into a lease in Lexington, Massachusetts for office and laboratory space with existing cleanrooms. We are executing on a plan to be able to qualify the cleanrooms for early phase clinical material production (multi-gram scale) by year-end 2023. We will continue to use CMOs to fill/finish and label/pack our clinical material. We plan to use a contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO, to produce mRNA in larger quantities. In November 2021, we engaged Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) as a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) for scale up and commercial scale production of our mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate pursuant to a Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) and a Product Specific Agreement (the “PSA”, and together with the MSA, the “Samsung Agreements”). Under the Samsung Agreements, Samsung is performing pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services for us over a period of years at its South Korean facility in exchange for service fees. We agreed that, if we enter into a purchase agreement for commercial quantities of drug product, we will pay Samsung, on a minimum take-or-pay basis for each year under that agreement, for our minimum purchase commitments, as determined pursuant to the terms of the Samsung Agreements. Based on our minimum purchase commitments, we expect to pay Samsung a minimum of approximately $8.8 million in service fees under the Samsung Agreements, excluding the cost of raw materials, which we must supply to Samsung separately. These fees include initial technology and analytical method transfer fees, process development and scale-up fees, process characterization fees, an annual project management fee, and per-batch engineering run fees. Based on our current schedule, we incurred $5.9 million of expense in 2022, with any remaining expense we expect to incur in 2023. If we move to commercial production, the agreement provides for additional process validation, inspection, cleaning, stability testing and commercial production fees, most of which would be incurred on a per-batch basis.
The Samsung Agreements will terminate on December 31, 2026, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with their terms. If we terminate the Samsung Agreements, we will generally be responsible for paying the purchase price for our aggregate product commitment for the remainder of the term, less any amounts we have already paid. Samsung agreed that, at or before the end of the term of the Samsung Agreements, it will assist us to transfer the commercial scale manufacturing process to a facility designated by us. The Samsung Agreements impose limits on Samsung’s liability to us for breaches of the agreements.

Supply for research and development
Depending on the testing needs of the program and the stage of development, we can produce various RNAs at various scales and levels of purity with a rapid turnaround.
Our dsRNA high through-put sample production capabilities are based at our Medford, MA site. We are able to produce about 100 products per week at the microgram to milligram scale for use in early discovery efforts to identify lead sequences or later in development to improve on the leads. We can also produce multi-gram scale quantities at a rate of about 10 products per month if required to support studies that necessitate significantly more material (e.g., lab assays on plant material or greenhouse trials). These materials are typically sent to our Durham, North Carolina facility for formulation.
 Our mRNA production capabilities are based at our Lexington, MA site. We are able to produce about 100 products per week at the microgram to milligram scale for use in discovery (e.g., antigen screening or antigen selection). We are also able to produce about 15 products per month at the 20 to 250mg scale if required to support translational research studies that necessitate significantly more material (e.g., in vivo studies in animals). For samples that require mRNA encapsulation, we also have this routine capability at our Lexington, MA site.

Supply for clinical trials & toxicology tests
 In 2021, we produced clinical material for our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, GLB-COV2-043 under phase-appropriate cGMP regulations for use in human trials. We engaged contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to complete the GMP fill/finish and clinical label/pack of these materials. We are in the process of reestablishing our ability to produce GMP clinical trial material in our Lexington facility, which we expect will be completed in the second half of 2023.
We have also produced mRNA and LNP formulations for multiple IND-enabling toxicology studies under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) procedures in our Lexington facility.

Human Health Product PIPELINE
Overview
 The key pillars of our human health strategy are as follows:
•Developing vaccines for infectious diseases, especially those addressing unmet medical needs in lower- and middle- income countries. Consistent with its public benefit corporation status, GreenLight is striving to support global, sustainable vaccine access and pandemic response readiness. 
 •Developing innovative products to address unmet medical needs in oncology and autoimmune diseases. This work has begun with the collaboration with EpiVax Therapeutics, Inc. to co-develop and commercialize personalized cancer vaccines, with the initial indication for the first potential product candidate targeting bladder cancer. 
 •Continued advancement of GreenLight’s mRNA technology platform through innovations and to seek potential partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
 Our mRNA platform consists of:
•The manufacturing process used to produce the product (described above) 
 •The mRNA molecule 
 •The delivery vehicle it uses to reach the target tissue 
 All elements of the platform affect product characteristics, such as purity, potency, and immunogenicity, so our teams work on optimizing mRNA molecules and delivery vehicles for a given indication, and the performance and cost of the manufacturing process.

mRNA molecule design
Changes in the mRNA molecule will result in changes in the protein we intend to express, mRNA stability, safety of the product and the immune response to the product.
First, we must choose the right target protein, after which an mRNA has to be designed for it. A well-designed mRNA molecule, with necessary modifications, will carry instructions for the relevant protein to be expressed safely and efficiently and for the desired duration. The mRNA composition can be optimized to avoid undesirable immune responses while increasing protein expression (or potency).

Delivery vehicles
To facilitate the mRNA to reach its destination without degradation, we must formulate it into a delivery vehicle. The delivery system’s design can influence potency, immunogenicity, safety and the product’s shelf life when stored before administration.
One such delivery system consists of encapsulating mRNA in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). We work with several established companies that have extensive experience in clinical LNPs for our vaccine candidates. We are able to routinely produce our mRNA-containing LNPs to support our research and development efforts. In addition, we work on stabilizing the LNPs to improve the storage conditions and shelf life of our products.

Our human health pipeline
We are currently working on infectious disease and oncology vaccine targets. We are exploring ways to expand our pipeline to include additional therapeutic areas, including gene therapies, in the future.
To get to the candidate selection phase of our product candidates in our human health pipeline, we must design and test the product candidates in vitro and in animal models, select the top product candidate to progress to IND-enabling toxicology studies, develop chemistry, manufacturing, and controls protocols and processes, create a clinical development plan to discuss with national health regulatory authorities as part of pre-consultation meetings, and manufacture, fill and finish the vaccine candidate material.
In order to begin Phase I clinical trials for any type of vaccine candidate in the United States, we must first successfully complete the required pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology study for demonstrating reasonable safety of the product candidate, submit an IND application to the FDA, which will include the scope of our proposed Phase I clinical trial, and satisfy all requirements required by the FDA for approval of the IND. We can offer no assurance that any clinical trial applications we

may file will be approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, in order to begin Phase I clinical trials, we must first produce the Phase I IND candidates in compliance with applicable cGMP regulations and conformity to our chemistry, manufacturing and controls protocols. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Manufacturing Platform.”
Prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases
The objective of a prophylactic vaccine is to expose the body to a protein (called the antigen) that is present in the disease-causing virus or bacterium so that it can generate a protective immune response in the absence of the pathogen and be prepared to fight the actual infection, should it occur in the future. mRNA could be used to encode the antigen as a way to expose the body to a component of the pathogen, avoiding the use of whole infectious agents.
Vaccines that use mRNAs present significant advantages compared to non-mRNA vaccines, including:
•The antigen expressed is a true match to the protein present in the pathogen, thus increasing the potential for an effective immune response as compared to vaccines produced through other methods in which manufacturing processes may result in changes to the antigen. 
 •The short development time from antigen selection to clinical trials and rapid manufacturing makes mRNA ideal for emerging epidemics or pandemic response. This is why the two mRNA COVID-19vaccines were among the fastest to be authorized. 
 •The same manufacturing plant can be used to produce mRNA vaccines against multiple potential indications. 
 
Opportunity
Immunization with prophylactic vaccines has become one of the most successful of all healthcare interventions. It is estimated that vaccines prevent 6 million deaths every year.
Our COVID-19 vaccine candidate
Unmet need
Although a large portion of the population in high-income countries has been vaccinated against COVID-19, widespread vaccination in mid- and low-income countries (“LMICs”) has lagged behind the developed world. As we enter the fourth year of the COVID-19 pandemic, continuous and substantial viral evolution create challenges to the ongoing public health response, including timely decisions on modifications to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition to provide protection. The rapid evolution of the virus and subsequent emergence of new variants which have exhibited a degree of immune escape from vaccination or prior infection has meant that there is a need for boosters which will be more broadly protective. There is also a need to improve the durability of the immune response for longer protection and intervals between boosters. The trajectory and timeline of further virus evolution are uncertain and delays between recommendations to update vaccine antigen composition and roll-out of updated vaccines significantly and disproportionately impact LMICs.
 
Product concept
Our initial COVID-19 vaccine candidate, GLB-COV2-043, used mRNA to encode the full-length spike protein of the Wuhan strain, formulated in LNPs. Concurrent with the development of GLB-COV-2-043, a monovalent booster candidate, we have been developing a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine candidate, which we are currently evaluating various potential candidates in preclinical studies for their ability to provide protection against a broad panel of sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. As previously announced, we are updating our clinical strategy to accelerate the development of this pan-sarbecovirus vaccine candidate instead of advancing the GLB-COV2-043 (monovalent) vaccine candidate as originally planned.

Achievements to date and future milestones
As part of the toxicology and pre-clinical testing, for our initial COVID-19 vaccine candidate, hamsters (16/group) were immunized at day 0 and 21 at three dose levels of 5 µg, 30 µg, and 100 µg of vaccine or controls of saline or LNP. At day 40 of the study, the animals were intra-nasally challenged with live SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate USA-WA1/2020). Animals were followed for 14 days, and their weights taken daily. This hamster challenge study revealed that all doses of GLB-COV2-043 provided protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge using percent body weight (% BW) change as a criterion. We observed a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in weight loss, compared to controls on Day 6, the peak of disease, and Day 14, the end of the challenge study.




Body weight changes of vaccinated hamsters after SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge
Hamsters (8/group) were immunized at day 0 and 21 at three dose levels of 5 µg, 30 µg, and 100 µg of vaccine or controls of saline or LNP (GLuc). Blood draws at day 21 (pre-boost: before injection of the second vaccine dose), and day 39 (post-boost: that is, 18 days after the second dose) were tested for neutralizing antibody titers against live SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate USA-WA1/2020).
All vaccine doses tested induced significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titer compared to controls, both Pre- and Post-Boost. The 100 µg and 30 µg doses of GLB-COV2-043 induced significantly or trending towards significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to control immunized animals. The GLB-COV2-043 vaccine candidate displayed a clear dose response after boost, demonstrating that is induces high titers of functional anti-SARS-CoV-2 capable of neutralizing virus entry into cells.


SARS-Cov-2 Serum neutralizing antibody titers for hamsters vaccinated with GLB-Cov-2-043. Day 21: 3 weeks after 1st vaccination dose. Day 39: 18 days after 2nd vaccination dose (*:p<0.05, ***: p<0.001: ns: p=0.0523)

After we completed pre-clinical testing, we were able to produce, fill, and finish the drug product using our own GMP facilities.
 As previously announced, GreenLight received approval from the Rwanda Food and Drugs Authority (Rwanda FDA) to initiate a Phase I/II study of its GLB-CoV2-043 (monovalent) vaccine booster candidate. However, given the global shift in the standard of care for COVID-19 vaccination to the Wuhan/Omicron bivalent vaccine and new availability of the bivalent vaccine in Rwanda, GreenLight is updating its clinical strategy to leapfrog monovalent and bivalent vaccines by accelerating development of its pan-sarbecovirus vaccine candidate instead of advancing the GLB-COV2-043 (monovalent) vaccine candidate as originally planned. We are aiming to produce a potential vaccine that will be effective against current and future COVID variants, including preparing for future potential pandemics.
Our Shingles Vaccine Candidate
In March 2022 we granted Serum Institute of India Private Limited (SIIPL), an exclusive license to use our proprietary technology platform to develop, manufacture and commercialize an mRNA shingles (herpes zoster) product and up to two other mRNA products in all territories other than the United States, the 27 member states of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Pursuant to our arrangement with SIIPL, we have engaged in designing and performing preclinical research to develop a shingles vaccine candidate.

Unmet need
Ninety-five percent of people older than 50 years of age have had chicken-pox. The varicella zoster virus causing this disease remains dormant in the body and reactivates periodically, which may result in herpes zoster or shingles. The lifetime risk of herpes zoster exceeds 30%, with global incidence rates estimated at 3 to 5 per 1,000 person-years overall, 5-11 per 1,000 person-years among adults ≥ 50 years of age and increasing age-specific incidence rates over the last 60 years. Increasing age is also associated with an increasing risk of debilitating complications with a significant impact on quality of life, functional status and productivity, and healthcare costs. The availability and cost of the vaccine currently available for herpes zoster prevention is prohibitively high for many in low- and middle-income countries where the associated impaired quality of life, morbidity, healthcare costs and lost productivity of herpes zoster and its complications have a disproportionate impact.

Our product concept
Our mRNA-based formulations are targeting key viral antigens known to play a critical role in the viral entry and life-cycle. We believe correctly selected antigens and formulations will produce a vaccine candidate with a competitive product profile.

Achievements to date and future milestones
Since March 2022, our Shingles vaccine program has progressed from the stage of concept evaluation to the stage of antigen design and pre-clinical evaluation in small animals. As part of our pre-clinical evaluation of our Shingles vaccines antigen in mice, we evaluated three antigens: VZV antigen#1, VZV antigen#2 and VZV antigen#3. We formulated these three mRNA vaccine antigens in three different lipid nano-particle (LNP) formulations: LNP#1, LNP#2 and LNP#3. Mice were primed with Varivax (attenuated VZV) and thereafter immunized intramuscularly with each of the mRNA-LNP candidates twice, at 0 and 8 weeks. Two doses were evaluated. We observed that all vaccine candidates were immunogenic and elicited high-levels of antigen-specific antibodies (IgG) after the first and second administration (panel A and B, below), comparable to the active control vaccine. These antigen-specific antibody levels were maintained up to 3 months (24 weeks) after the last administration (panel C, below), demonstrating the durability of the humoral immune response.
 



In addition, the mRNA vaccine candidates formulated with LNP#1 (and LNP#3) were more potent in eliciting strong cellular immune response, when compared to the active control vaccine.
 
Finally, when we evaluated the memory response, we observed that at 24 weeks, the mRNA vaccine candidates formulated with LNP#1 maintained memory T cells (panel A, below) and memory B cells (panel B, below) responses at levels similar to comparator vaccine (active control), demonstrating ‘durability’ of the immune response.
 
Based on the pre-clinical studies and evaluation of the three potential candidates highlighted above, GreenLight has selected a lead candidate to progress towards clinical development. We are in active discussions with SIIPL regarding potential plans forward for this vaccine candidate.

Oncology Vaccine Program
 On January 8, 2023, we entered into an exclusive collaboration agreement with EpiVax Therapeutics, Inc. (“EVT”), pursuant to which GreenLight and EVT agreed to exclusively collaborate with each other to develop, manufacture and commercialize mRNA-based oncology vaccines using GreenLight proprietary technology and EVT proprietary technology.

Unmet need
 mRNA vaccines represent a therapeutic option with potentially improved product profiles and faster development pathways than current oncology therapeutics. We believe that an mRNA-based vaccine could solve some of the biggest unmet needs in oncology.
Under our collaboration with EVT, the first indication we plan to target is bladder cancer, an area with significant unmet needs. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men globally but inadequately addressed by existing therapies. Surgery (cystectomy) yields only a 50-60% 5-year survival rate, and radical cystectomy is debilitating even with reconstructive surgery. Cisplatin (chemotherapy) is another option, but 50% of the patient population is ineligible. Lastly, less than 30% of patients respond to checkpoint inhibitors, and those that do typically experience severe side effects.

Our potential product concepts
 We are currently in the early stages of our collaboration and work with EVT. Under the collaboration, we envision using EVT’s high-speed, automated, secure, cloud-based commercial platform, Ancer, to process cancer protein sets and identify patient-specific neoantigens and their neoepitopes.

GreenLight plans to take the personalized, multi-antigenic, mutanome-directed therapeutic peptide (comprised of, e.g., 20-40 neoepitopes) identified and created by EVT’s proprietary platform and append/apply our mRNA and DNA design rules, experience, and know-how to create a personalized mRNA that encodes for the peptide such that the peptide is expressed by target cells in the cancer patient. Rapid turnaround (e.g., estimated at 4-8 weeks) from patient tumor biopsy/sequencing to a personalized drug product that is ready for administration is important. Our research-scale mRNA-LNP production capabilities routinely support fast turnaround of material for pre-clinical studies (in vitro, in vivo) and GLP toxicology testing that is of the same scale that we anticipate will be required for an mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccine. We plan to combine our small-scale fast turnaround process with our experience with cGMP regulations and available cleanroom space at our Lexington, MA site to create a capability that can generate phase-appropriate material for early-stage clinical trials.
 
Global RNA Manufacturing Network
 Our vision is to enable Africa, Asia, and Latin America and other potential LMICs to meet local demand through production outside the United States and Europe, from drug substance to product to fill and finish of mRNA vaccines and therapies, ideally in the country where the vaccine will be sold. If our vaccines and therapies are approved in these jurisdictions, we intend to contract with local manufacturers to produce our products, which we believe will enable the accessibility and cost competitiveness of our products.
If we obtain applicable regulatory approvals, we intend to create an interoperable network with local production facilities deploying our manufacturing process using modular design concepts that can be constructed off-site and set up more quickly than traditional construction models, so each facility will rely less on international supply chains to create vaccines and therapies for local needs.
Strategic Collaborations
Collaborators are part of our core strategy as we seek to accelerate our development of RNA therapies. We have relationships with research hospitals, universities, foundations, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in our pipeline programs. During research and development stages, we seek collaborators to complement our preclinical studies and manufacturing capabilities. At the clinical development stage, we will seek established collaborators to codevelop or commercialize our product candidates. For vaccines, we are seeking companies with commercial capabilities that will receive rights to develop and commercialize our vaccine candidate(s). In this way, we can share the risk and reward of our portfolio while acquiring the capabilities required to launch commercial products. We seek partners aligned with our mission of making RNA accessible to the world.
Our decision to partner will be determined by the partner’s geographic scope and the complementary capabilities that partner can bring to support the commercialization of products. For example, our partnership with SIIPL is focused on unmet medical needs in infectious diseases for LMICs and our collaboration with EVT focuses on personalized cancer vaccines globally. We continue to evaluate and consider when potential partnerships can bring strategic advantages to the company and when we may choose to commercialize some early-stage programs without partners, as large-scale commercial capabilities may not be required for programs with a small patient population.
PLANT HEALTH PRODUCT PIPELINE

Overview
We plan to design, build, and sell a complete portfolio of products that growers can use throughout the food chain, from field to fork, to enhance, protect, and preserve produce and animals.
Our product pipeline is based on double-stranded RNA, or dsRNA, which works by regulating the expression of a carefully selected protein in the target organism, be it in plants, fungi, or animals (primarily insects or arachnids). This method can, with careful selection of the appropriate target, potentially be used to control a wide range of unwanted pests and problems.
The success of our plant health product pipeline will depend on us inventing and bringing to market new uses of RNA in agriculture. Since our product candidates are first of a kind, we typically do not project the timing of a product candidate coming to market until later stages of our development process when we draft a Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act ("FIFRA") dossier for internal review. While we believe our projected timelines are reasonable, given that we are introducing new modes of action for pest control, it is difficult to predict when we will be able to obtain the regulatory approvals required for commercial sales and our expected timelines may be subject to change. Our initial experience with bringing RNA-based agricultural products to market were based on the conception, development and testing of CalanthaTM and we continue to grow our development and regulatory experience as we develop RNA solutions to manage a range of target pests.


 GreenLight intends to use, and has taken steps to use, its platform to expand its market access by progressing its product development from generation 1, high-value crops (e.g. single target solutions designed to demonstrate proof-of-concept for dsRNA-based agricultural solutions intended to be primarily registered and commercialized by GreenLight), to generation 2, multitarget products (e.g.solutions designed to address multiple targets, anticipated to be developed in collaboration with partners that possess significant distribution capabilities for large markets and retained in house for high value), to generation 3, systemic delivery capabilities (e.g. solutions delivered to the plant to target weeds, nematodes or improve nutrition; intended primarily to be developed in partnership with crop fertility and other potential partners).

An introduction to dsRNA and agriculture
As a tool for crop protection, dsRNA has several advantages. It is designed to impact the target pest and limit harm to any non-targeted organisms. Unlike many other pesticides, dsRNA degrades quickly in the environment, so it is typically undetectable after a few days, meaning in typical use, treated produce would contain low to no pesticide residue. Finally, in the event any residue remains, there is an established history of safe consumption of RNA molecules in human and animal food. According to a September 2020 report published by the Environmental Directorate of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) entitled Considerations for the Environmental Risk Assessment of the Application of Sprayed or Externally Applied ds-RNA-Based Pesticides, there is a long-established view that dietary intake of nucleic acids, including dsRNAs from plant viruses, does not present a health risk to humans and other vertebrates, and, as a result, the adoption of RNAi technology in agriculture is likely to present a lower human health risk than the use of conventional pesticides.

Process for developing new products
GreenLight uses an internally-developed five-phase product development process for plant and animal health products, which sets forth key activities and requirements to achieve for each potential product from proof of concept through commercial launch (Phase 1a: discovery/lab studies and greenhouse trials; Phase 1b: confirmatory trials; Phase 2: proof of concept field trials; Phase 3 and 4: regulatory submission). In general, in order for a product to move to a particular stage, it must successfully have met the requirements of the preceding stages. This process enables us to have a disciplined product development path with defined inflection points that we believe will increase our likelihood of success in bringing a product to market.

Market opportunity
Given the versatility of RNA-based solutions, we believe that the markets for our products are large. In the near term, we intend to pursue addressable target markets for plant health, with the commercial launch of our first product anticipated by the end of 2023 assuming regulatory approval earlier in the year.
We intend to develop products for our own distribution as well as for commercial partners. In doing so, we will focus our attention on the fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts markets, which urgently need residue-free crop-protection products or have a strong association with the need to conserve honeybees. We will seek to serve the broadacre markets and international markets through partnerships with established multinational crop-protection companies and distributors. We intend to develop products that farmers trust and incorporate as a regular part of their annual crop-protection program.
Each of the initial products we are developing is intended to be specific to one target pest based on grower needs. We have also begun research and development of potential products that target multiple pests or that can be systemically delivered to plants. We believe that we can continue to leverage on our expertise in RNA as well as use our manufacturing platform and experience to make novel products at a cost that works for farmers.

What specific problems are we trying to solve?
Our plant health team is working to provide growers with highly effective tools to use within their normal cultural practices that avoid disrupting non-target organisms while leaving low to no residue in the foodstuffs. Today there are very few commercially available products that successfully combine these characteristics that growers, regulators, and consumers desire. Our primary focus for this mission is the successful deployment of carefully designed dsRNA. In order for our products to function successfully, the pest that needs to be managed must possess the appropriate cellular apparatus to process exogenous dsRNA to regulate protein biosynthesis. For these organisms, we intend to develop a portfolio of insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, and products that impact crop physiology and health, such as bio stimulants, improved stress tolerance and herbicides.

Insecticides and acaricides
Our insecticides and acaricides program is currently working on six major pest complexes. These projects are distributed across various phases ranging from the most advanced, which is in the pre-commercial phase awaiting regulatory approval, to nascent candidates. We calculate addressable markets for our projects using market data from AgbioInvestor and FAOSTAT and

information purchased from third-party consultants. We use this data as well as our industry knowledge to inform assumptions around expenditures to control the target pest or disease to arrive at the addressable market.

Colorado potato beetle
CalanthaTM, our product candidate for the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), which decimates plants in the nightshade family and accounts for more than $500 million in crop loss annually, has gone from discovery to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) submission in four years. The formulated product is mixed with water and sprayed using standard agricultural practice over crops at a rate of 9.9 grams per hectare—less than one-tenth the rate at which many conventional industrial chemicals are normally used on fields. Consumption of the dsRNA, which itself degrades within days, causes the Colorado potato beetle to stop eating and expire from its own toxins while beneficial insects are unaffected. In the United States, we have tested this product over the last four annual growing seasons in Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, New York, Maine and Idaho. We have also conducted field tests of the product in Spain, Germany and France.
Based on the results of our toxicity testing, GreenLight requested a tolerance exemption from the EPA for the active ingredient contained in CalanthaTM. If granted, such an exemption would be consistent with a category IV toxicity level, the EPA’s lowest level of pesticide toxicity under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”).
We believe the addressable market for protecting crops from the Colorado potato beetle is approximately $350 million. Assuming EPA approval in 2023, we anticipate to commercially launch by the end of 2023.
Widely recognized for its ability to develop resistance to pesticides, the Colorado potato beetle was first described as a pest in the United States in 1859.
We expect the price and performance of CalanthaTM, the first-ever foliar RNA product to be competitive with other products currently available to farmers. We have conducted more than 200 field trials over five years to develop a product that has shown to be effective at just 9.9 g/hectare, an extremely low active ingredient use rate, equivalent to a spoonful of sugar spread on a football field.
Our testing has shown that CalanthaTM is safe for honeybees, butterflies, and several other non-target insects and mammals at use rates 100 times higher than our recommended rate. It degrades in water and soil within three days to benign, natural nucleotides. The product works well with standard growers’ programs to control first-or second-generation Colorado potato beetles. It effectively controls all stages of the life of this beetle but is most effective on young larvae up to one-quarter inch in length.
In addition to being water soluble, this product contains additional inert ingredients to allow it to be mixed with other agricultural products and applied by farmers in a single spraying using common methods, including low-water volume (aerial or ground) or chemigation. Although conventional pesticides can require special protective equipment for farmers, we anticipate just basic work gloves will be required for this product.

Varroa mites
Having acquired the rights to portions of Bayer’s topical RNA intellectual property portfolio, which include bee-health assets, we are developing an RNA-based syrup that targets reproductive mites, is easy to use, and will add another tool in the limited Varroa-control market.
We have been field testing our RNA-based product candidate for the Varroa destructor mite, which many beekeepers consider to be the top threat to honeybees and which has been detected in up to 90% of US hives, since March 2021 with the assistance of commercial beekeepers in Georgia, California, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Maine. To date, these tests demonstrate a measurable improvement in mite control and hive health.


Mite control is measured in number of mites per 100 bees. Trials conducted in 2022 showed lower mite levels using GreenLight’s 4 g/L solution when compared to a chemical control or an untreated control over the course of 18 weeks after first treatment. We also evaluated hive survival rates and found that the GreenLight 4 g/L solution statistically outperformed the untreated control, the chemical control, and the GreenLight 2 g/L solution over the course of 30 weeks after first treatment.
About 3 million commercial honeybee colonies in the United States are used to pollinate more than 100 crops annually that are worth an estimated $18 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The parasitic Varroa mite reproduces in hives, feeds on honeybees, and spreads disease, destroying colonies across the globe. Our product candidate targets the Varroa mite to protect bees, beekeepers, and pollination-dependent crops.
When we acquired rights from Bayer relating to its bee-health assets, Bayer disclosed to us that in laboratory tests its original Varroa mite product had been observed to have adverse effects on ladybugs. We are developing our own version of this product using our proprietary manufacturing process, and our product has a different composition than the Bayer product. We have observed adverse effects on ladybugs in laboratory tests of products made with our dsRNA manufacturing process but only at 10x higher use rates than Bayer observed. We do not believe that such data will negatively impact our ability to secure a registration from the EPA or impact the attractiveness of our product to potential customers for two reasons. First, during the normal course of use, our product would be delivered in a sealed package directly to beehives, and it is atypical for ladybugs to enter a treated beehive during the proposed treating season. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the organisms that may be negatively affected would be exposed to the product during the normal course of use. Second, we believe that customers would conclude that the benefits of controlling Varroa mites outweigh the potential risks to ladybugs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Animal Health Program” for a discussion of several risks factors relating to our Varroa mite product.
As part of our preparation for seeking EPA approval of our Varroa mite product, we conducted laboratory and field tests, including a required high-dose test to assess risks associated with potential overexposure to the product. When we tested our Varroa mite product in the laboratory at the required level of ten times the field use rate, the higher concentration of the product caused the treated bee food to become highly viscous, which limited consumption and resulted in bee starvation. We did not observe these adverse effects either when our product was administered at the field use rate or when our product was administered at the high-dose rate in the field. Because our product is delivered in a ready-to-use formulation through a pre-measured pouch delivery system, rather than through conventional spraying, we do not believe that our product presents a material risk that bees will be exposed to concentrations greater than the field use rate. For more information regarding potential adverse effects on regulatory approval of our Varroa mite product, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Animal Health Program—The EPA will evaluate our Varroa mite product without a precedent product, which may result in the need to conduct additional field trials and lengthen the regulatory review period. If we cannot demonstrate bee safety, the EPA may not approve our product or may impose labeling requirements that materially limit the commercial attractiveness of the product.”
In preparation for submission to the EPA, we completed additional studies, including additional bee studies. We have also continued to conduct additional non-target organism studies for dossier inclusion and submission. Additionally, the viscosity of our formulation makes it difficult for us to rely solely on a Tier 1 toxicity study under the EPA guidance, and we have therefore recently conducted and completed Tier 2 toxicity studies. For the United States registration of our Varroa mite product, we submitted a registration dossier to the EPA in February 2023. In certain foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, we expect that we will be required to apply for authorization of our Varroa mite product as an animal health product under applicable veterinary medicine regulations.


Vegetable Caterpillar Complex
 The Diamond Back Moth (Plutella xylostella) is sometimes called the cabbage moth because of its voracious appetite for consuming brassicas plants, which include cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower, among others. It represents a global challenge to farmers and growers because its short life cycle allows it to rapidly develop resistance to existing crop protection products.
By testing Diamond Back Moth larvae in greenhouse assays (where they are fed foliage treated with their specific RNA sequence combined with the different delivery technologies we have developed), we believe that the Diamond Back Moth can be controlled with a dsRNA-based pesticide. We are now testing delivery methods by which the product would be delivered to the field. Small scale field tests in the US and Spain have demonstrated activity of formulated dsRNA against Diamond back moth. We anticipate expanding the spectrum of our product my carefully modifying trigger design to include other moth species of importance in vegetable crops before moving into our pre-development phase in 2023 and the development phase in 2024, with the goal of a launch after 2026, subject to receipt of regulatory approval.
Spider Mite Complex
 Two spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) (TSSM) are not insects but arachnids that feed on plants. All life cycle stages of the mite will cause damage to the plants upon which they feed. TSSM use their mouthparts to pierce cells on the surface of the leaf to suck out the contents, rendering the cell useless. TSSM will feed on a wide range of crops from Glasshouse ornamentals to tree nuts and fruits to corn and soybeans and can be found almost anywhere crops are grown. This project is currently in the discovery phase where we are seeing from our early research results, good control from our on-plant assays without any need for specific delivery technology. We plan to expand the spectrum of our product by carefully modifying trigger design to include other plant feeding mite species of importance before progression into pre-development in 2024 and move rapidly on to development in 2025 by having an initial focus on controlled environment crops.
Fungicides
Our fungicides program currently has six major targets in the pipeline. This includes botrytis, fusarium, powdery mildew, downy mildew, Asian soybean rust, and rice blast. We calculate addressable markets for our projects using market data from AgbioInvestor and FAOSTAT and information purchased from third-party consultants. We use this data as well as our industry knowledge to inform assumptions around expenditures to control the target pest or disease to arrive at addressable market.
Gray Mold +
 Botrytis cinerea, which causes gray mold and bunch rot, is an ever-present global threat for fresh fruit and vegetables that affects 80% of crops grown and can result in up to 30% yield loss. Even greater losses can occur when botrytis develops en route to the consumer. Given how frequently crops such as grapes, berries, and onions need to be sprayed, resistance to existing chemical fungicides can build quickly and produce can carry residues of multiple products. Botrytis has long been a target for new biological fungicides, but excessive rain or humidity means that very few of these products can be relied on to work consistently.
We began testing our Botrytis product in California, New York and Italy in 2021 and are currently working to add additional spectrum to our final end use product prior to commencing the studies for our regulatory dossier in 2023. California, a major market for this product, could lag EPA approval by up to a year or more. Because this product demonstrated disease control in the field on both of the crops that we tested (strawberries and grapes), we progressed into the pre-development phase at our portfolio review in December 2021. We are currently working on proof-of-concept development field trials and expanding the spectrum of our product by carefully modifying trigger design to include other fungal species of importance in vegetable and fruits and berry crops before continuing to advance the development of this program. At this stage of development, we believe we can bring this potential product, subject to receipt of regulatory approval, into the market after 2027.
 
Powdery mildew complex
Powdery mildew, caused by Erysiphe necator, is the most common and destructive disease affecting grapes. Mostly observed on the upper surface of leaves as a dusty gray or white coating, the disease also strikes the lower surface, young stems, buds, flowers, canes, and fruit. Severely infected leaves may exhibit mottling or deformity, including leaf curling and withering. Infected fruit turn grayish-white first, then exhibit a brown, rusted appearance and may crack, shrivel, or drop from clusters.
We conducted our first season of field trials in 2021 in New York and California, and we were able to demonstrate disease control comparable to current leading chemical-control products. We anticipate one more year of field trials with the goal of regulatory submission in 2024. Assuming the EPA approves the product in 2026, we would expect to begin commercialization that year. California, a major market for this product, could lag EPA approval by up to a year or more, and non-US grape growing

regions such as France could also take one or more additional years to obtain approval. Because this product demonstrated disease control in the field on both of the crops that we tested (strawberries and grapes), we progressed the project into the pre-development phase at our portfolio review in December 2021. We are currently working on expanding the spectrum of our product by carefully modifying trigger design to include other powdery mildew species of importance in a range of crops before conducting development trials and advancing towards formulation development and believe we can bring this potential product, subject to receipt of regulatory approval, into the market by 2026.

Mycotoxin control
 Fusarium Head Blight is a disease of cereal crops most typically caused in the United States and Europe by Fusarium graminearum, though some other Fusarium species are implicated. Fusarium species have a wide host range and can cause many different types of damage to crops depending upon the type of crop plant and its growth stage at the time of infection. In the form of the disease which infects the flowering ear of the cereal crop, Fusarium does not necessarily rob the farmer of yield but instead frequently produces mycotoxins as part of its metabolic process. These mycotoxins can cause serious illness and even death when consumed in small quantities (the primary mycotoxin is deoxynivalenol, or DON, known colloquially as vomitoxin), so there is a detection limit in process food stuffs of 11 ppm. dsRNA can be designed to inhibit the metabolic pathway that produces the mycotoxins. We believe the ability to do this is a key differentiator for GreenLight. The current fungicides available to the grower may control the pathogen but do not provide reliable suppression of the mycotoxins. This product is currently in greenhouse trials, with GreenLight having demonstrated under controlled conditions that it can stop mycotoxin production on growing wheat. Aflatoxins cause food spoilage and are thought to be a primary cause of liver cancer in Africa. Their control is currently an unmet need that organizations, such as the Partnership for the Control of Aflatoxins in Africa, are trying to solve. We believe we can modify our DON control sequences to suppress aflatoxin production. Once designed, we expect that we will need to complete two seasons of field testing given the importance of mycotoxin control for public health. Based on our product development to date, we believe we can move this project into later stages of our development process in late 2024, which we believe would allow us to move through the remaining development phases and into the market, subject to prior regulatory approval, by 2026 at the earliest.

Crop physiology
Our activities in crop physiology, crop stress tolerance, and herbicides have taught us how to deliver dsRNA into many different types of cells, so we are expanding our research to give us further opportunities in the stress tolerance and crop-protection market. GreenLight believes there is promise in emergent technologies that can deliver dsRNA into the plant by spray, seed treatment or root uptake. If we can advance these technologies sufficiently, we will begin to select new projects to develop products that can exploit the markets requiring such properties.

Limitations we are working to overcome
The use of dsRNA as a crop-protection technology has been proposed since the discovery of the mechanisms of RNAi in the 1990s. A key barrier to the development of dsRNA was the cost of manufacturing RNA itself.
Our proprietary cell-free technology aims to solve this problem. Other technical, commercial, and social challenges remain, with delivery as the next challenge. Not all organisms will readily uptake dsRNA in the way that the Colorado potato beetle and Varroa mite do, and we need to deploy strategies that overcome barriers for lepidoptera (the rate of breakdown in the gut) or plants (passage across membranes). Much of our mid and long-term pipeline target work relates to addressing the challenge of extending environmental stability both within the gut of target insects and on the leaves of sprayed plants.
Another perceived limitation of dsRNA is associated with its highly specific nature. While we believe that this specificity is a benefit because it can make the technology safer for beneficial insects and humans, we realize most products on the market are broad-spectrum, which is appealing to farmers because they enable farmers to control multiple pests or diseases at once. Understanding this need, we are also now working to develop and include in our pipeline, multi-target products as described above.
 Finally, delivering dsRNA to the insects targeted for control is one of the most significant challenges in using dsRNA as a pesticide since each insect and insect habitat represent unique challenges. Delivery methods can include spray (which we use with CalanthaTM), injection, seed treatment or root uptake. We continue to explore alternative means of delivery.
Biotechnology and agriculture have a complicated history. We know that building trust with stakeholders is critical to ensuring smooth adoption. We seek to educate about dsRNA and the benefits of what it can do. By increasing awareness of the benefits of RNA biopesticides, we hope to form strong relationships with other sustainability-oriented initiatives and industry stakeholders who can help tell our story.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
Our people and culture
At GreenLight, we celebrate the power of working together to address humanity’s challenges, meet the needs of underserved populations, and push the boundaries of scientific discovery. Our culture represents a team united by a common purpose of creating a more sustainable future by bringing food security, medicine, and healthcare to everyone. From the very beginning, our founders believed that our way forward would be based on equality, diversity, and inclusion (ED&I). These founding principles guide us every day as we seek to identify, attract, retain, incentivize, and develop a highly talented workforce.

Qualified team
Building a platform through RNA manufacturing to address food and agriculture markets and human health markets in vaccines and therapies requires deep technical and scientific expertise. We make every effort to recruit and retain the most qualified and mission-oriented team members. As of March 15, 2023, we have 262 full-time employees. Within our workforce, the substantial majority of our employees are engaged in research and development, supply chain and manufacturing operations and the remainder are engaged in the shared business-enabling functions. About 54% of our team members who are focused on research and development have masters degrees or higher, a majority of whom have PhDs. Our employees are not represented by any labor union nor any collective-bargaining arrangement with respect to their employment with us.
 In addition to our regular workforce, we are grateful for the collaboration, contributions, and support of a network of industry advisors, consultants, contractors, and temporary staff who make up the overall GreenLight team.
In October 2022, we announced a corporate realignment to focus on key anticipated near-term value drivers and extend the Company's cash runway. With the realignment, the Company is seeking to improve its organizational structure through certain team integrations that are expected to allow the Company to more efficiently support its research, development and commercialization goals.
 With ED&I principles as the foundation, we are focused on cultivating a team with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We consider how we can better serve our colleagues of different genders, ethnicities, generations, educational achievements, sexual orientations, workstyles, and more. Our current senior management team is diverse: 60% of our executive management team members are female as of March 2023. Our management team is committed to continuing to build a diverse team and a culture of inclusion to ensure that diverse perspectives thrive.
Numbers alone cannot capture the rich diversity of our company. However, we collect and report these numbers for transparency and as a marker of our continued efforts. As of March 15, 2023, 47% of our full-time employees self-identify as female and 45% of full-time employees self-identify as a non-Caucasian racial or ethnic group (Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, or two or more races). While we acknowledge that there is still work to be done, we are committed to doing our part to make real changes to address systemic bias and inequities.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Strategy
Environmental and social impact is inherent to our purpose and the underlying reason our company was launched. We were founded to develop sustainable products for some of the biggest issues facing humanity and the planet. GreenLight scientists are developing new products for public health challenges and sustainable food production to feed a growing population. We believe our ESG strategy is fundamental to achieving our mission and underscores everything we do at GreenLight.
We are striving to optimize the environmental impact of our facilities and operations, but we recognize the greatest potential for impact is through our product development process and in our goal to design and manufacture RNA-based products to support human, animal and plant health more naturally and safely. Furthermore, we believe that our technology platform could be used to enable low- and middle-income countries and underserved populations to have access to potential human health and plant health solutions that are currently difficult to obtain.
Environmental
There is a need to take immediate action to address the environmental crisis that is forcing the reconsideration of how products are made, from our homes to our food, to our clothing. Many modern approaches to produce food and drugs to keep the growing population healthy have had a negative effect on the health of the planet. Clear cutting forests for crops, chemical residues on food, in the water and in the soil, nitrogen blooms in rivers, declining soil productivity, the loss of bees and other beneficial insects—these are all clear signs that the current system is not sustainable.

For years, farmers have used effective petroleum-based chemical pesticides in the form of neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates. Over time, these non-targeted products can have unintended negative consequences, including damage to beneficial insects and plants, and they can linger in the environment for years, eroding soil quality and polluting water resources.
Using RNA, we can create targeted biocontrols for agriculture. Biology also offers a fundamental shift in how things are made and disposed of in a world where things grow and decay, creating circular, regenerative processes. Our goal is to have products that can help the environment, not harm it. GreenLight’s RNA is produced from materials using an enzymatic process and after application our RNA product candidates disappear in a few days. We believe that, because the active RNA ingredients in our product candidates quickly degrade in the environment, our product candidates will have the potential to be more sustainable, or greener, than traditional petroleum-based chemical pesticides.
We aim to provide farmers with safe-to-use, cost-effective, targeted biocontrols that stop pests while protecting crops, honeybees, and land before and after harvest. If we help farmers create greener, cleaner crops, they can provide consumers with the greener, cleaner foods they demand. Additionally, we also intend to provide farmers with safer products to handle, while helping farming families promote more sustainable land for future generations.
When we refer to a product or process as ‘green’ in the context of potential agricultural products, we are referring to the fact that dsRNA-based pesticides have the potential to leave little to no residue behind after use, resulting in a significant potential reduction in the toxins or other foreign matter released into local waterways, aquifers, or the food chain. Additionally, when we use the term ‘sustainable,’ we refer to our efforts to align economic development with environmental protection and human well-being as well as our obligations as a Public Benefit Corporation under § 362(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Social
 Values and biases can be embedded in the technologies that are made, in the applications that are considered, and in the ways problems are addressed. Inclusion of those who have historically been left out of the development of new technologies is essential to building equitable and positive outcomes. GreenLight was born from a passion to make our world more sustainable and more equitable. Our vision is to enable Africa, Asia, Latin America, and other LMICs to meet local demand of RNA based products through local production.
 An ecosystem thrives with more diversity, and the inclusion of many different voices is essential to growing our company. Team members are empowered to bring their best ideas forward, and leaders are always open to listen and act. We challenge one another to discover breakthroughs that advance our science to deliver on a common cause: sustaining the planet, protecting our food, saving lives. With equity, diversity, and inclusion principles as the foundation, we are relentlessly focused on cultivating a team with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We are always thinking about how we can better serve our colleagues of different genders, ethnicities, generations, educational achievement, sexual orientation, and workstyles. These values and initiatives are not just a top-down corporate statement; they are an intrinsic part of our culture.
Governance
At GreenLight, we celebrate the power of working together to address humanity’s challenges, meet the needs of underserved populations, and push the boundaries of scientific discovery. Our culture represents a team united by a common purpose of creating a more sustainable future by bringing food security, medicine, and healthcare to everyone. From the very beginning, our founders believed that our way forward would be based on equality, diversity, and inclusion (ED&I). These founding principles guide us every day as we identify, attract, retain, incentivize, and develop a highly talented workforce.
The following values are deeply coded within our business, mission, and culture:
•Care for everyone 
 •Courage to achieve the impossible 
 •Collaboration to propel our success 
 •Commitment to science and doing the right thing, always 
 Our culture is built on care, transparency, diversity, employee ownership and engagement, and a deep, humble respect for science. Transparency is essential to how we operate, to enable sharing of the insights and tools that enable our platform to grow, as well as to build trust and accountability with all our stakeholders.
We have selected independent directors and scientific advisory board members with decades of experience. Our board of directors and management team will leverage that experience and consider the interests of stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, academic researchers, governments, communities, and other stakeholders to pursue long-term value for our company and drive the sustained health of our global community.


Competition
We are aware of only one large company, Bayer AG, that has human health and agricultural capabilities similar to our company. Other competitors split into either human health or agricultural market categories.

Human health
Our competitors are biotechnology companies working on indications similar to our pipeline, mRNA companies, large pharmaceutical companies, and academia.
We are aware of several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as smaller, early-stage companies, pursuing the development of products and disease indications we are targeting. These include major vaccine and therapeutics companies such as Roche Holding AG, AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Merck & Co Inc, Sanofi, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax.
Among RNA specialist companies, BioNTech and Moderna already have COVID-19 vaccines on the market, while CureVac N.V., Arcturus Therapeutics Inc., Daiichi Sankyo, Elixirgen Therapeutics, and Providence Therapeutics have clinical trials underway. Specialized therapeutics companies such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Editas Medicine, and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals also compete against GreenLight. In the personalized cancer vaccine space, a number of companies have clinical stage candidates, such as Moderna, BioNTech, Gritstone, Evaxion, Nykode, StemiRNA, Nouscom and Geneos.

Agriculture
We believe that our technology platform coupled with our research and development expertise and commercial strategy set us apart from others in the food and agricultural market. Because crop protection is a mature industry, there are several companies targeting similar insects and fungi and investing in effective products. These include larger companies such as Syngenta and Bayer, as well as smaller companies such as Provivi, Vestaron, and Biotalys. Creating the sustainable food system we know is possible will require the expertise and dedication of many people bringing many new products to market. We look forward to collaborating with many companies, even those we have called out as competitors, to achieve that future.
Platform
Our platform, and our ability to manufacture biological molecules, is a key competitive advantage and driver of future growth. Ginkgo Bioworks, and Codexis, among others, have sophisticated know-how and may emerge as competitors.
Facilities
Our principal facilities are located in the metropolitan area of Boston, Massachusetts, Rochester, New York, and Durham, North Carolina. We lease all our facilities.
Our corporate headquarters is located in Lexington, Massachusetts, where we lease approximately 59,000 square feet of office and laboratory space. Our lease for this facility expires in June 2032.
 We believe our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs. To support future organic growth or merger-and-acquisition activity, we may enter into new leases, assume lease obligations, or acquire property both domestically and internationally. We believe that suitable or alternative space will be available if and when needed.
Agricultural Manufacturing Facilities
Our manufacturing facilities for our dsRNA agricultural products are located in Rochester, New York. Our lease for this facility commenced in January 2020 and expires in March 2026. Our existing manufacturing operations occupy approximately 24,000 square feet and include two 2,000-liter bioreactors, one of which has been operational since second quarter of 2021 and the other of which has been installed and we expect to be operational in the second quarter of 2023. Activation of the second bioreactor and additional associated packaging equipment requires an estimated investment of approximately $1.4 million, of which $0.3 million had been committed as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we leased approximately 5,000 square feet of additional space in the Rochester facility for storage.
Agricultural Laboratory and Greenhouse
We currently lease approximately 63,000 square feet of laboratory, office and greenhouse space for our agricultural operations at our facility in Durham, North Carolina. Our lease for this facility commenced in January 2022 and expires in December 2033.

In March 2022, the Company entered into a lease for land in Spain to enable agricultural research and development activities. The lease term expires in March 2042.
 In December 2022, the Company entered into a lease for land in Colusa County, California to enable it to conduct certain agricultural research and development activities. The lease term expires in December 2032.
 
Human Health Facilities
In March 2022, we leased approximately 59,000 square feet in Lexington, Massachusetts for research and development activities, including clean rooms for early-phase clinical material manufacturing for our human health program. Our lease for this facility commenced in May 2022 and expires in 2032. We plan to establish our ability to produce GMP clinical trial material in Lexington in the second half of 2023.
We currently have approximately 69,000 square feet of office and lab space in Medford, Massachusetts and Woburn, Massachusetts. Approximately 52,000 square feet of office and lab space has a lease expiry of February 2024. The remaining 17,000 square feet of office and lab space in Medford has a lease expiry of February 2025. GreenLight is actively marketing to sublease approximately 55,000 of the lab and office space between these two locations.
 Intellectual property
We strive to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets to develop, strengthen, and maintain proprietary positions that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent-term extensions, where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents and patent applications; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; maintain and defend our trademark registrations and applications; and operate without infringing the valid, enforceable patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to limit third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products or using our proprietary methods may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, trademarks or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products or methods of manufacturing and using the same or that they will prevent others from commercializing competing products or technology.
Patents
As of March 10, 2023, we had approximately 40 patent families (the term “patent family” is used here to denote patents and applications claiming priority to a common patent application) in various fields of our business. Of those patent families, approximately six families relate to RNA production; approximately seven families relate to other human health-related technologies; approximately 18 families relate to crop protection and bee health; approximately three families relate to production of sugars; and approximately six families relate to process control and compound production. The number of families may change if we file additional applications or obtain additional issued patents or if we abandon any of our pending or issued patents. We continue to evaluate the costs and potential benefits of patent protection in various jurisdictions. In connection with such evaluations, we may abandon pending applications or issued patents.
Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending on the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which patent applications are filed, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. Under certain circumstances, a patent term can be extended. For example, in the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term-adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in reviewing and granting a patent; by patent-term extension for certain patents covering products requiring regulatory approval prior to being sold or methods of using or making such products; or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends on many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.

Our six RNA production patent families include four families directed to RNA production platforms. All four families, including all of the issued patents in such families, contain claims directed to methods of manufacture of RNA and/or related processes. One platform family includes U.S. Patent No. 10,858,385, the issued claims of which protect certain aspects of our process for production of dsRNA. This family also includes issued patents in Australia and Israel, a pending U.S. continuation and a number of foreign applications pending in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, the European Patent Office, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Ukraine. The projected expiration for U.S. Patent No. 10,858,385 is in 2037, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable.
Another RNA production platform family also contains claims that protects certain aspects of our processes for production of dsRNA. This family contains U.S. Patent No. 10,954,541 along with a pending U.S. continuation, issued patents in Australia, India, Indonesia, and Japan and a number of foreign applications pending in jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, the European Patent Office, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Ukraine.

This family contains a United States application along with pending applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including, Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa. All applications in this family are national or regional stage applications from International Application No. PCT/US2020/025824. If the U.S. patent application in this family were allowed, the projected expiration of the resultant patent would be in 2040, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable.
The RNA production families also contain patent applications directed to various improved compositions and processes. These include two families related to plasmid templates for production of RNA products, proteins and enzymes of interest. One family consists of national and regional stage applications stemming from international application No. PCT/US2021/047111 and the other consists of national and regional stage applications stemming from international application No. PCT/US2020/063490. Both families contain applications pending in the U.S. as well as a number for foreign jurisdictions. If we were to obtain U.S. patents in either family, they would have projected expiration dates in 2040 and 2041, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable.
Other Human Health Patent Families
We currently have seven additional human health specific patent families. One family includes a U.S. patent application directed to compositions and methods of treatment related to our ongoing research in the field of gene therapy. This family also includes a number of national and regional stage applications that claim priority to the related International Application No. PCT/US2021/042015, including applications filed with ARIPO and EPO, as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. If the U.S. patent application were to be allowed, the projected expiration of the resultant patent would be in 2041, not including any term adjustments or extensions if applicable. Another family contains a pending United States provisional patent application related to the same research. Another of the families contains a U.S. application and an international application directed to mRNA compositions, including certain mRNA vaccine designs. One family contains a recently-filed PCT application directed to improved formulations for mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. Another family contains a pending provisional application related to improved formulations for mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. One family contains a pending provisional application related to improved mRNA constructs for vaccines and therapeutics. And the seventh family contains a pending provisional application directed to pan-sarbecovirus mRNA vaccine designs.

Intellectual Property Agreements
Bayer Acquisition Agreement
We entered into an Assignment and License Agreement with Bayer CropScience LLP (“Bayer”) dated December 10, 2020 (the “Bayer Acquisition Agreement”), pursuant to which we acquired from Bayer certain intellectual property rights related to (i) RNA technology used to control Varroa mites, Nosema, and bee viruses, which includes assignments of patents and a license to research, develop and sell methods and products in such field with the use of Bayer “know-how” with respect to such technology, and the assignment of Bayer’s rights under a license agreement with Yissum Research and Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem LTD (the “Yissum License”), and (ii) technology used to control the Colorado potato beetle and canola flea beetle, including a license to research, develop and sell methods and products in such field with the use of Bayer patents and “know-how” with respect to such technology. Under the Bayer Acquisition Agreement, we were obligated to make a closing payment to Bayer equal to $2,000,000 as well as certain milestone payments equal to up to $2,000,000 in the aggregate, in the event that certain regulatory approvals are achieved with respect to the aforementioned technologies.
We also agreed to indemnify Bayer against losses arising out of GreenLight’s recklessness, willful misconduct, violation of law or breaches of representations or warranties under the Bayer Acquisition Agreement or activities related to the use of intellectual property assigned to GreenLight thereunder. The Bayer Acquisition Agreement shall survive for so long as the assigned patents remain in effect; provided, that the parties do not terminate the Bayer Acquisition Agreement earlier in accordance with its terms.
Under the Bayer Acquisition Agreement, GreenLight was assigned Bayer’s rights and obligations under the Yissum License. Pursuant to the Yissum License, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the relevant technology to develop, manufacture, market, distribute, or sell covered products, including an exclusive, worldwide license under Yissum’s interest in any bee health patents jointly owned with GreenLight. Notwithstanding the exclusive license, Yissum retains the right to practice the jointly-owned patents in ways that will not result in competition with GreenLight, including the right of the Hebrew University of Israel (the “University”) to practice the inventions for the University’s own internal research and educational purposes, and to license other academic and not-for-profit research organizations to do the same, provided that no such license directly or indirectly harms our commercial interest in the relevant patents and products.

We also have the right, but not the obligation, to prosecute in our own name and at our own expense any infringement of patents jointly owned with Yissum, but in making our decision whether to assert infringement, we must give consideration to the views of Yissum. In order to settle any such infringement suit, we must obtain the consent of Yissum.
Pursuant to the Yissum License, we agreed to pay Yissum a running royalty percentage in the low single digits on net sales of the licensed products. The License ends on a country-by-country basis upon the later of the date of expiration of the last valid licensed patent, the end of regulatory exclusivity for a product, or 20 years from the date of first sale.
Pursuant to the Yissum License, we are liable for any loss, injury or damage whatsoever caused to our employees or to any person acting on our behalf or to the employees of Yissum or to any person acting on our behalf or to any third party, by reason of GreenLight’s acts or omissions pursuant to the Yissum License or by reason of any use made by GreenLight of the licensed technology and products. Moreover, we will compensate, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Yissum or any person acting on its behalf or any of its employees or the University or representatives of the University against any liability imposed upon them by GreenLight’s acts or omissions or which derive from GreenLight’s use, development, manufacture, marketing, sale or sublicensing of any product or licensed technology unless it has been determined by an adjudicator of last resort that that the particular damage, loss or expense was caused by a particular indemnitee’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Either party may terminate the Yissum License upon written notice in the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding of the other party. Yissum may terminate the license agreement if we do not commercialize products within a reasonable timeframe, with certain exceptions, if it provides written notice and we do not cure such failure within a certain timeframe; or if we have an uncured lapse in necessary insurance coverage; or if we unreasonably fail to respond to third-party claims against the patents or technology licensed under the Yissum License.
Patent expiration is a legal determination under the laws of each relevant jurisdiction worldwide. Third parties may review public patent filings and make their own determination as to patent expiration based on the available documents. The last to expire U.S. Patent under the Yissum License is expected to expire in 2031.
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
We entered into a Grant Agreement with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (the “Gates Foundation”) dated July 20, 2020, as amended by that certain Amendment 1 to Grant Agreement dated May 25, 2021 (as amended, the “Gates Grant”) pursuant to which we were awarded a grant in the amount of approximately $3.3 million, payable in milestone tranches, for research regarding treatment and curative therapies for sickle cell disease and/or durable suppression of HIV in developing countries. We utilize the Gates Grant funds to explore new, low cost capabilities for the in vivo functional cure of sickle cell disease as well as the durable suppression of HIV. In the event that GreenLight has materially breached the Grant Agreement, the Foundation may demand repayment of the Gates Grant funds. As previously announced, we paused work on our gene therapy program for sickle cell disease, and as a result, we ceased any ongoing research work under the Gates Grant and are in the process of closing out all related activities. We are in the process of delivering the final report to the Gates Foundation and returning any remaining unused funds to the Gates Foundation.
Acuitas Therapeutics
Development & Option Agreement
In August 2020, we and Acuitas entered into a development and option agreement, or the Acuitas Option Agreement. Under the Acuitas Option Agreement, the parties agreed to jointly develop certain products combining our RNA constructs with Acuitas’s LNPs. Each party granted the other party a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under its proprietary technology to conduct the joint research. We pay Acuitas’s personnel costs and external expenses incurred in performing research in accordance with a work plan under the Acuitas Option Agreement. Under the Acuitas Option Agreement, Acuitas granted us options to obtain non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable licenses under Acuitas’s patent rights and know-how related to LNP technology, or Acuitas LNP Technology, with respect to three specified targets, or Reserved Targets, to develop and commercialize one or more therapeutic products incorporating Acuitas LNP Technology and our RNA constructs. We paid Acuitas a technology access fee of $750,000 at the outset of the Option Agreement. Thereafter, we are obligated to pay an annual technology maintenance fee of $250,000 for each option that has not been exercised and target reservation and maintenance fees of $100,000 per Reserved Target until such Reserved Target is removed from the Reserved Target list or until we exercise an option with respect to such Reserved Target.

On exercise of the first option, we were required to pay a $1.5 million option exercise fee after execution of the first non-exclusive license. On exercise of the second and third options, we are required to pay a $1.75 million and $2.75 million option exercise fee after execution of the second and third non-exclusive licenses, respectively.
Unless earlier terminated, the Acuitas Option Agreement will remain in effect until the first to occur of (1) all options are exercised, and (2) three years from the effective date, except that we can choose to extend the three-year term for an additional two years. Either party may terminate the Acuitas Option Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or a similar event. We may terminate the Acuitas Option Agreement at our convenience following written notice to Acuitas. To GreenLight’s knowledge, the last to expire U.S. patent under the Acuitas Option Agreement will expire in 2041 if the last filed relevant U.S. patent application currently identified by Acuitas is allowed. However, additional intellectual property, including patents, may still be added to the Acuitas Option Agreement or may not be known to us. Therefore the last to expire patent under that Option Agreement may change. Moreover, patent expiration is a legal determination under the laws of each relevant jurisdiction worldwide. Third parties may review public patent filings and make their own determination as to patent expiration based on the available documents.
Any jointly developed intellectual property under the Acuitas Option Agreement is jointly owned by the parties in an undivided one-half interest to such joint intellectual property.
Non-Exclusive License Agreement
In January 2021, we exercised the first option under the Acuitas Option Agreement and entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Acuitas, or the Acuitas License Agreement. Acuitas granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under the Acuitas LNP Technology to research, develop, manufacture, and commercially exploit a vaccine product consisting of our RNA constructs and Acuitas’s LNPs. We paid Acuitas an option exercise fee of $1.5 million. Under the Acuitas License Agreement, we are required to pay Acuitas an annual license maintenance fee of $1 million until we achieve a particular development milestone. Acuitas is entitled to receive potential clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments of up to $17.25 million in the aggregate. With respect to the sale of each licensed product by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, Acuitas is entitled to receive low single digit percentage royalties on net sales of the licensed product in a given country until the last to occur, in such country, of (i) the expiration of all licensed patent rights covering the licensed product, (ii) expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for the licensed product, or (iii) ten years from the first commercial sale of the licensed product, or Royalty Terms. We are entitled to certain royalty reductions and offsets with respect to each licensed product in a given country if no licensed patents cover the licensed product or if we are required to obtain rights to third party patents that relate to LNP technology. Unless earlier terminated, the Acuitas License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire Royalty Term. Either party may terminate the Acuitas License Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or a similar event. We may terminate the Acuitas License Agreement at our convenience following written notice to Acuitas.
Additional intellectual property, including patents, may still be added to the Acuitas License Agreement or may not be known to us. Therefore the last to expire patent under that License Agreement may change. Moreover, patent expiration is a legal determination under the laws of each relevant jurisdiction worldwide. Third parties may review public patent filings and make their own determination as to patent expiration based on the available documents. To GreenLight’s knowledge the last to expire U.S. patent under the Acuitas License Agreement will expire in 2041 if the last filed relevant U.S. patent application currently identified by Acuitas is allowed.
Serum Institute License Agreement
GreenLight entered into a License Agreement dated as of March 10, 2022 with Serum Institute of India Private Limited (“SIIPL”), pursuant to which GreenLight granted SIIPL an exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-bearing license to use GreenLight’s proprietary technology platform to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to three mRNA products in all territories other than the United States, the 27 member states of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (the “SIIPL Territory”). The first licensed product target will be a shingles product, and SIIPL has an option to add up to two additional product targets through the end of 2024.
Pursuant to the SIIPL License Agreement, SIIPL agreed to pay GreenLight an upfront license fee of $5.0 million, as well as payments upon target selection and reservation of exclusivity. In addition, GreenLight may receive up to a total of an additional $17.0 million in milestone payments across all three product targets, as well as manufacturing technology transfer payments up to $10.0 million. SIIPL agreed to make royalty payments on the sale of products resulting from the licensed technology for the term of the SIIPL License Agreement. The SIIPL License Agreement shall terminate on a product-by-product and country-by-country

basis on the later of the expiration of the patent rights owned by GreenLight or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the applicable product(s) in the applicable country.
SIIPL is responsible for the development, formulation, filling and finishing, registration and commercialization of the products in the SIIPL Territory, subject to oversight from a joint steering committee composed of representatives of GreenLight and SIIPL. SIIPL agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for the products in the countries in the SIIPL Territory. The SIIPL License Agreement includes terms customary in the industry for provisions related to sublicensing, intellectual property, and termination, and customary representations and warranties of GreenLight and SIIPL, along with certain customary covenants, including confidentiality, limitation of liability and indemnity provisions.

EpiVax Therapeutics Collaboration Agreement
 On January 8, 2023, GreenLight entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with EpiVax Therapeutics, Inc. (“EVT”), pursuant to which GreenLight granted EVT an exclusive, royalty-free sublicensable license to use GreenLight’s proprietary technology platform and EVT granted GreenLight an exclusive, royalty-free sublicensable license to use EVT’s proprietary immunoinformatics tools, in each case, to develop, manufacture and commercialize mRNA-based oncological vaccines (whether therapeutic, prophylactic or otherwise) in all territories worldwide. Furthermore, GreenLight and EVT each agreed to exclusively develop, manufacture, commercialize and collaborate with each other on mRNA-based pharmaceutical preparation, substance, formulation or dosage (whether singly or in combination with any other product, materials, or technology) that uses the GreenLight technology and the EVT technology for the treatment of diseases through mRNA-based oncological vaccines. The initial indication for the first potential product candidate will target bladder cancer. GreenLight, at its option, will be the sole manufacturer for such jointly developed products under the Collaboration Agreement.
 Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, GreenLight and EVT will initially bear their own costs of development until achievement of certain agreed upon events, and thereafter, each of GreenLight and EVT will bear fifty percent (50%) of all development costs. Furthermore, beginning on the first commercial sale of a product, the parties will share in the pre-tax profit (loss) from commercialization of products under the Collaboration Agreement with each of GreenLight and EVT bearing (and entitled to) fifty percent (50%) of the pre-tax profit (loss) for such products.
After one-hundred eighty (180) days from the effective date of the Collaboration Agreement, either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement with fifteen (15) days’ prior notice. The Collaboration Agreement includes terms customary in the industry for provisions related to sublicensing, intellectual property, and termination, and customary representations and warranties of GreenLight and EVT, along with certain customary covenants, including confidentiality, limitation of liability and indemnity provisions.
Government regulation
We are using our RNA manufacturing platform to develop products for human health and agriculture, and we are subject to laws and regulations for those markets. These regulations currently apply to development and testing of our products and in the future will apply to manufacturing, import, export, marketing, and sale of products.
Human health products
We are developing human health products that include vaccines for COVID-19, shingles and oncology. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and biologics under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

U.S. biologics regulation
In the United States, biological products such as gene therapies and vaccines are subject to regulation under the Federal FDCA, the PHSA, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements (“GLPs”); 
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (“BLA”), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”); and 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must typically review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and 


distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA submission and review by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required

inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time-period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-approval requirements
Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
 •clinical holds on clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Biosimilars and reference product exclusivity
The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.

Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
Laboratory licensing and certification requirements
We are planning to partner with contract laboratories who are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”), which requires all clinical laboratories to meet certain quality-assurance, quality-control, and personnel standards.
Agricultural products
We are developing insecticides and fungicides to protect crops and acaricides to protect honeybees that are beneficial to crops. In the United States, the development, testing, and commercialization of these products are regulated by the EPA through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), the Food Quality Protection Act (“FQPA”) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”).
In general, FIFRA prohibits the sale or distribution of any pesticide, a product category that includes the insecticides, fungicides, and acaricides we are developing, unless that pesticide is registered with the EPA. To register a pesticide with the EPA, the applicant must demonstrate that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. These adverse effects include any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of the pesticide, as well as any human dietary risk from residues that result from use of the pesticide in or on any food consistent with the FFDCA. In the course of its evaluation of a pesticide, EPA assesses the impact that a pesticide may have on endangered species and non-target organisms.
Because our products contain novel RNA-based active ingredients, there will generally be no previously registered pesticide product containing that active ingredient and, as a result, the use of each of our products will require a new registration under FIFRA and the establishment of a tolerance under Section 408 of the FFDCA or the issuance of a tolerance exemption.
In order for the EPA to register a pesticide:
•the applicant must first conduct specified studies to evaluate mammalian toxicology, toxicological effects to non-target organisms in the environment (ecotoxicological exposures), and the product’s physical and chemical properties; 
 •the applicant must then submit to the EPA a registration dossier that includes data demonstrating that the product does not pose unreasonable risks; 
 •the EPA will conduct both scientific and administrative reviews of the dossier, including a thorough evaluation of submitted safety data and completion of risk assessments for human dietary and ecotoxicological exposures; 


•if the EPA identifies any risks that appear to exceed regulatory standards or any other deficiencies in the dossier, it will ordinarily issue a letter identifying the deficiencies; 
 •the applicant will have one or more opportunities to address any deficiencies, including the submission of factors that mitigate any risks identified in the EPA’s risk assessments; this process may involve ongoing submissions and coordination with the EPA to address any unresolved concerns; and 
 •the EPA will undertake various stages of internal review prior to making a final decision on the application. 
 The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act, enacted in 1996 and subsequently renewed, can serve to reduce the data requirements and timeline related to regulatory approvals for biopesticides when compared to other pesticides, with EPA approvals typically received within 16 to 24 months, compared with 36 months or longer for conventional chemical pesticides.
As part of the pesticide registration process, the EPA under its FFDCA authority establishes tolerances for pesticide chemicals, which consist of limits on pesticide residues that may remain on feed or feed commodities. In some cases, the EPA may issue a tolerance exemption when the chemical will have no impact on human health.
Even if a FIFRA registration is granted, the EPA has the authority to revoke the registration or impose limitations on the use of any of our pest management products if we do not comply with the regulatory requirements, if unexpected problems occur with a product, or if the EPA receives other newly discovered adverse information.
In addition to the approval by the EPA, we are required to obtain regulatory approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities in individual states and foreign jurisdictions before we can market or sell any pest management product in those jurisdictions. In most U.S. states, local authorizations typically take one to three months after EPA approval. In other states, such as California, Arizona and New York, regulatory authorities require additional data specific to their respective jurisdictions, and the process for having a product approved or denied can last an additional two to three months, or longer, for these states.
Outside the United States, the registration process varies by jurisdiction and can take between 24 and 84 months to complete. In most instances, initial submissions to foreign regulatory authorities will not occur until after a U.S. registration has been secured. Moreover, foreign governments typically require up to two seasons of locally generated field efficacy data on crop/pest combinations before a product dossier can be submitted for review. For example, in the EU, we would need to obtain authorization under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, which sets forth rules for the authorization, sale, use, and control of plant protection products, in order to market our products, and regulators may seek to require our products to comply with maximum residue levels under Regulation (EC) NO 396/2005.
In some instances, California and Canada will conduct joint reviews with the EPA, which allows some pesticides to receive concurrent approvals in California, Canada and the United States. California and foreign jurisdictions also require us to submit product efficacy data. Historically, the EPA has not required the submission of product efficacy data, but may request it.
The microbial strains used in our agricultural manufacturing process are also regulated by the EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). In some circumstances, TSCA requires entities to provide notice to the EPA prior to the manufacture or importation of new microorganisms, called a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice (“MCAN”). Persons intending to manufacture or import these microorganisms for commercial purposes in the United States must submit an MCAN to the EPA at least 90 days before such manufacture or importation. The EPA has 90 days to review the submission in order to determine whether the microorganism may present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. If the EPA makes that determination, the EPA may impose appropriate regulatory restrictions on the microorganism.
Finally, a number of our products may require registration or approval under various state regulatory programs, including those relating to fertilizers, auxiliary plant substances, soil amendments, beneficial substances and/or biostimulants.
