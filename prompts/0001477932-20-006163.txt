Item 1. Description of Business
COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2008 as Silver Bay Resources Inc. On June 30, 2010, the Company changed its name to Takedown Entertainment Inc and on July 24, 2012, the Company changed its name to Green Hygienics Holdings Inc.
 
The Company seeks to be an innovative, full-scope, science-driven, premium hemp cultivation and branding enterprise focused on the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp for the purpose of extracting cannabidiol (“CBD”). 
 
On June 1, 2017, the Company accepted the resignations of Rick Powell, Jim Loseth, and David Ashby as Directors and Officers of the Company and the Company accepted the appointment of Ronald Loudoun as President, Secretary, Treasurer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, and Director of the Company.
 
On October 30, 2018, Rick Powell (“Powell”) transferred 13,500,000 common shares of the Company by way of a Gifting Agreement to Alita Capital Inc. (“Alita”), a company controlled by Ronald Loudoun, and on October 30th, 2018, Wilderness Custom Exteriors Ltd. transferred 9,000,000 common shares by way of a Gifting Agreement to Alita.
 
Effective April 29, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Coastal Labs, LLC (“Coastal”), a California limited liability company to acquire all of the assets of Coastal. The total consideration for the assets would be, at the Company’s election, $3,000,000 or a total of 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock issuable over five years. In addition, the Company would enter into consulting agreements with each individual member of Coastal, or such entity as each respective member may designate, that sets forth ongoing compensation to each individual member of Coastal. The parties further agreed to form a new entity or arrange for the transfer of ownership of Coastal to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to hold the acquired assets, to enter into an operating agreement that governs the operation of the assets, and to establish a board of directors for the subsidiary of up to 6 members, of whom 3, or half, whichever is greater, shall be nominees of Coastal. Further, the Company would assume all of Coastal’s contracts relating to sales and distribution of the products. The acquisition of the assets of Coastal has not closed, and either party may terminate the agreement at any time.
 
In June, 2019, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries, Coastal Labs NC LLC (“Coastal NC”) and Green Hygienics NC LLC (“Green NC”) for the purpose of registering as an industrial hemp processor and cultivator in the State of North Carolina pursuant to the North Carolina Industrial Hemp Pilot Program.
 
On June 10, 2019, the Company secured a multiyear purchase order for the sale of hemp to U.S. Tobacco De Mexico. Under the terms of the contract, the Company is required to deliver a total $56.4 million worth of hemp flower over a five-year period to US Tobacco De Mexico for use in the production of CBD hemp cigarettes. Since the issuance of the purchase order, the Company and US Tobacco De Mexico determined to renegotiate the purchase order due to several reasons, including production capacity and market price fluctuation. This contract has been cancelled due to the significant drop of more than 90% in wholesale price of hemp biomass which is used to make CBD hemp cigarettes. The parties are working on a modified version of the deal.
 
On June 14, 2019, the Company secured from the County of San Diego Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures a registration for industrial hemp cultivation as a grower. 
 
On July 22, 2019, the Company secured licenses for the processing of hemp in the state of North Carolina. The licenses were granted to the Company’s newly formed subsidiary, Coastal NC, by the North Carolina Industrial Hemp Commission. The Company’s second subsidiary in the state is Green NC, which will be partnering for cultivation this year with the intention of meeting the earnings qualification to be licensed on its own for next year’s cultivation.

On August 26, 2019, the Company the completed the acquisition of 824 acres of land known as the Potrero Ranch Property, located near San Diego, California for a purchase price of $4 million. The Company is utilizing the land and buildings for industrial hemp for CBD cultivation. The property includes over 400,000 square feet of outbuildings that are currently being converted into greenhouses. The Company entered into an agreement payable with the seller of the property for $2,750,000 for a portion of the purchase price. The terms of the agreement are monthly payments of interest only at the rate of 6% per annum. This debt is secured by a promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the real property. The maturity date of the debt is August 23, 2024. The Company also entered into an agreement payable for $1,760,000 with monthly payments of interest only at the rate of 15% per annum. This debt is also secured by a promissory note secured by a second charge on the deed of trust on the real property. The maturity date of this debt is August 15, 2024.
 
In October 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase the real property located at 13795 Blaisdell Place, Poway, California 92064, which includes a building containing approximately 15,048 square feet of R&D space on a 0.95 acre lot, for $4,000,000, of which $2,000,000 is payable in cash or common stock of the Company, and of which $2,000,000 would be financed pursuant to a promissory note and secured by a deed of trust on the property. The Company has until January 15, 2021 to obtain the necessary financing to consummate the transaction.
 
In April 2020, the Company received USDA Organic Certification for its 824-acre farm and 400,000 square feet of greenhouse space. The Company considers the USDA Organic Certification to be one of the most recognized certifications among US consumers and provides another level of assurance to shoppers who may be concerned about the safety of CBD products. In addition to assuring that no synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides have been used in the cultivation of hemp, the USDA organic certification ensures that farmers are using tillage and cultivation practices that maintain or improve the condition of soil and minimize soil erosion through crop rotations, cover crops and the application of plant and animal materials.
 
In July 2020, the Company planted its first large scale hemp crops for cultivation. The planting covers approximately 120 acres of land and three greenhouses. The Company anticipates harvesting these initial crops by December 31, 2020. The Company had previously planted a smaller crop in 2019 that was fully impaired due to unfavorable weather conditions. In the early growing stages, the plants were severely damaged by a sand storm and could not be salvaged. 
 
We had $40,538 in cash as at July 31, 2020. We anticipate that we will incur approximately $240,000 for administrative expenses, including professional legal and accounting expenses associated with compliance with our periodic reporting requirements over the next twelve months. We will need additional funding for the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp for the purpose of extracting CBD.
 
We are contemplating raising additional capital to finance our business operations. It is anticipated that funding for the Company will come from one or more of the following means: engaging in an offering of our stock, engaging in borrowing, or locating a joint venture partner or partners. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information).
