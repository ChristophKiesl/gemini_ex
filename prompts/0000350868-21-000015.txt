Recent Developments
COVID-19 Update
The COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) has materially adversely impacted global economic conditions. More than 12 months into the Pandemic, COVID-19 continues to have an unpredictable and unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy as federal, state and local governments react to this public health crisis with travel restrictions, quarantines and "stay-at-home" orders. The uncertainties caused by the Pandemic include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, workplace dislocations, economic contraction, and downward pressure on some customer budgets and customer sentiment in general. While there has been no material impact to our business during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”), we did experience some work delays due to the Pandemic. Should such conditions become protracted or worsen or should longer-term budgets or priorities of our clients be impacted, the Pandemic could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the Pandemic on our business and financial results, and the volatility of our stock price will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak, the impact on capital and financial markets, the distribution, rate of adoption and efficacy of vaccines, and the related impact on the budgets and financial circumstances of our customers, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of this report.
Given the uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the Pandemic on the Company's future financial condition and results of operations, the Company has taken certain actions to preserve its liquidity, manage cash flow and strengthen its financial flexibility. Such actions include, but are not limited to, reducing discretionary spending, reducing capital expenditures,

implementing restructuring activities, and reducing payroll costs, including employee furloughs, pay freezes and pay cuts (see Note 4, Restructuring Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act provides relief to U.S. corporations through financial assistance programs and modifications to certain income tax provisions. The Company is applying certain beneficial provisions of the CARES Act, including the payroll tax deferral and the alternative minimum tax acceleration (see Note 6, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
The Company assessed the impacts of the Pandemic on the estimates and assumptions used in preparing these audited consolidated financial statements. The estimates and assumptions used in these assessments were based on management’s judgment and may be subject to change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the Pandemic and its resulting impact on global economic conditions. If economic conditions caused by the Pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management, the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially impacted. See below for areas that required more judgments and estimates as a result of the Pandemic. The Company will continue to assess the effect on its operations by monitoring the spread of the Pandemic and the actions implemented to combat the virus throughout the world and its assessment of the impact of the Pandemic may change.
Acquisition of the Assets of TrafficCast International, Inc.
On December 6, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with TrafficCast International, Inc. (“TrafficCast”), a privately held company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin that provides travel information technology, applications and content to customers throughout North America in the media, mobile technology, automotive and public sectors. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to purchase from TrafficCast substantially all of its assets, composed of its travel information technology, applications and content (the “ TrafficCast Business”). The transaction closed on December 7, 2020.
Under the Purchase Agreement, Iteris purchased from TrafficCast substantially all of the assets used in the conduct of the TrafficCast Business and assumed certain specified liabilities of the TrafficCast Business in exchange for a total purchase price of up to $17.7 million, with $15.0 million paid in cash on the closing date, $1.0 million held back as security for certain post-closing adjustments and post-closing indemnity obligations of TrafficCast, $1.1 million acquisition-related liability, and a $1.0 million earn out, fair valued at $0.6 million as of March 31, 2021, that if earned, will be paid over two years based on the TrafficCast Business’ achievement of certain revenue targets. The Purchase Agreement also provides for customary post-closing adjustments to the purchase price tied to working capital balances of the TrafficCast Business at closing (see Note 12, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
The parties also entered into certain ancillary agreements that will provide Iteris with ongoing access to mapping and monitoring services that the TrafficCast Business uses to support its real-time and predictive travel data and associated content.
Sale of Agriculture and Weather Analytics Segment
On May 5, 2020, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of our assets used in connection with our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment to DTN, LLC (“DTN”), an operating company of TBG AG, a Swiss-based holding company, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) signed on May 2, 2020, in exchange for a total purchase consideration of $12.0 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Upon closing on May 5, 2020, the Company received $10.5 million in cash and $1.5 million of deferred payment, of which $1.45 million has been paid by DTN at the 12-month anniversary of the closing date, and $0.05 million will be paid by DTN at the 18-month anniversary of the closing date, subject to satisfactions of the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement relating to the transition of certain customers to DTN and the collection of certain receivables by DTN (see Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Restructuring Activities
On April 30, 2020, in connection with the sale of the Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment, the Board of Directors of Iteris, Inc. approved restructuring activities to better position the Company for increased profitability and growth. Restructuring charges of approximately $1.5 million were incurred for separation costs for certain employees who did not transition to DTN, additional positions that were eliminated to right-size the cost structure of the Company, and the impairment of certain lease-related assets (see Note 4, Restructuring Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Public Offering and Acquisition of Albeck Gerken, Inc.
Table of Contents

On June 13, 2019, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 6,182,797 shares of the Company's common stock for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $26.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used approximately $6.2 million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the cash portion of the purchase price in the acquisition of AGI, a privately-held professional transportation engineering services firm headquartered in Tampa, Florida (see Note 12, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and plans to use the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and possibly for other future acquisitions.
Products and Services
Our reportable segments consist of: Roadway Sensors and Transportation Systems.
The Roadway Sensors segment provides advanced detection sensors and systems for traffic management that collectively comprise our family of Vantage sensors and BlueTOAD line of products, as well as communication systems and roadway traffic data collection applications that complement our sensor products. The Vantage product line uses advanced image processing technology, radar technology and other techniques to capture and analyze sensor data through sophisticated algorithms, enabling vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian detection, as well as the transmission of both video images and multiple data sets using various communication technologies. The Roadway Sensors segment also includes the public sector operations of TrafficCast beginning December 7, 2020 (see Note 12, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
The Transportation Systems segment provides traffic engineering and specialized consulting services, cloud-enabled managed services, transportation performance measurement and traffic analytics solutions, as well as the development of transportation management and traveler information systems for the smart mobility infrastructure management industry. The Transportation Systems segment also includes the operations of AGI beginning July 2, 2019 as well as the commercial operations of TrafficCast beginning December 7, 2020 (see Note 12, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on the acquisitions of AGI and TrafficCast).
With the company’s adoption of the ClearMobility platform we have started aligning our portfolio of solutions under a common branding structure called ClearMobility. We believe this alignment to the ClearMobility Platform will drive internal synergies in our development and sales efforts, as well as increase our market recognition across our entire suite of solutions. As a result of this alignment, the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is evaluating our management and operating structure and as a result of this evaluation we anticipate that we will report as a single operating segment starting with our fiscal year 2022.
In the fourth quarter of the 2021 fiscal year, we launched the ClearMobility Cloud, our open-architecture cloud framework for smart mobility infrastructure management. The ClearMobility Cloud’s mobility data management engine, application programming interface ("API") framework and microservices ecosystem provide standardized data ingestion, cleansing and analytics, as well as authentication and security for each component of the ClearMobility Platform. The ClearMobility Cloud sets the foundation for horizontally scalable data processing, third-party extensibility, and secure, policy-based access to public transportation agencies and commercial entities throughout the United States and internationally.
See Note 13, Business Segments, Significant Customer and Geographic Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our reporting segments.
Roadway Sensors
Our Roadway Sensors products include, among others, Vantage, VantageLive!, Vantage Next, VantagePegasus, VantageRadius, Vantage Vector, Velocity, SmartCycle, SmartCycle Bike Indicator, SmartSpan, VersiCam, PedTrax, P-Series products, BlueTOAD Spectra, BlueTOAD Spectra RSU, and BlueARGUS.
•Our Vantage detection systems detect vehicle presence at intersections, as well as vehicle count, speed and other traffic data used in traffic management systems. Vantage detection systems typically include up to four of our advanced cameras and/or radar devices. Our Vantage systems give traffic managers the tools to mitigate roadway congestion by visualizing and analyzing traffic patterns, allowing them to modify traffic signal timing to improve traffic flow. Our various software components complement our Vantage detection systems by providing integrated platforms to manage and view detection assets remotely over a network connection, as well as mobile application for viewing anywhere.
•Our Vantage Vector video/radar hybrid product is an all-in-one detection sensor with a wide range of capabilities, including stop bar and advanced zone detection, which enable advanced safety and adaptive control applications. 
Table of Contents

Vantage Vector includes all of the benefits of Iteris video detection, including high accuracy, high-availability remote viewing of video images, bicycle and pedestrian detection capability, and dilemma-zone detection.
•VantageLive! is a cloud-based platform that allows users to collect, process and analyze advanced intersection data, as well as to view and understand intersection activity.
•All of our Vantage systems are available with SmartCycle capability, which can effectively differentiate between bicycles and other vehicles with a single video detection camera, enabling more efficient signalized intersections, improved traffic throughput and increased bicyclist safety. Agencies using bicycle timing can now benefit from bicycle-specific virtual detection zones that can be placed anywhere within the approaching traffic lanes, eliminating the need for separate bicycle-only detection systems.
•The SmartCycle Bike Indicator, which leverages the SmartCycle bicycle detection algorithm, is a device that mounts onto traffic signals and illuminates when cyclists waiting at an intersection have been detected, allowing cyclists to avoid interacting with vehicle traffic to push pole-mounted buttons.
•Our Vantage systems are also available with the PedTrax capability, which provides bi-directional counting and speed tracking of pedestrians within the crosswalk to help improve signal timing efficiency, as well as providing an additional data stream to existing vehicle and bicycle counts.
•VersiCam, our integrated camera and processor video detection system, is a cost-efficient video detection system for smaller intersections that require only a few detection points.
•BlueTOAD Spectra is a complete system for identifying the travel times of vehicles using advanced Bluetooth re-identification techniques. This provides traffic flow information for vehicle travel as well as Origin-Destination information.
•BlueARGUS collects, analyzes and visualizes various information related to travel times, speeds, O-D, as well as connected vehicle information from the BlueTOAD Spectra RSU.
•BlueTOAD Spectra RSU is a full-featured connected vehicle and travel time information system. In addition to travel times and vehicle speeds it communicates vital safety and mobility information via both DSRC and C-V2X from infrastructure to vehicles and other users.
We believe that future growth domestically and internationally, will be dependent in part on the continued adoption of above-ground video and radar detection technologies, instead of traditional in-pavement loop technology, to manage traffic.
In select territories, the Roadway Sensors segment also sells certain complementary original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") products for the traffic intersection market, which include, among other things, traffic signal controllers and traffic signal equipment cabinets.
Transportation Systems
Our Transportation Systems segment includes engineering and specialized consulting services, transportation performance measurement and traffic analytics solutions, end-to-end solutions delivered as cloud-enabled managed services, as well as the development of transportation management and traveler information systems for the smart mobility infrastructure management industry. Our Transportation Systems services include planning, design, development and implementation of software and hardware-based ITS systems that integrate sensors, video surveillance, computers and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor, control and direct traffic flow, assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews, and distribute real-time information about traffic conditions. Our services include planning, design, implementation, operation and management of surface transportation infrastructure systems. We perform analysis and study goods movement, commercial vehicle operations, provide travel demand forecasting and systems engineering, and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion. The Transportation Systems segment also includes the commercial sector operations of TrafficCast beginning December 7, 2020 (see Note 12, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
The Transportations Systems segment product line includes: the Iteris Signal Performance Measures ("Iteris SPM") and iPeMS traffic signal performance and traffic analytics software suites, the capabilities and customers of which have now respectively been incorporated into and migrated to ClearGuide, our state-of-the-art mobility intelligence and transportation performance measures solution; our advanced traveler information system ("ATIS") solution for public transportation agencies, ClearRoute; and our ATIS solution for the enterprise and commercial sector, TrafficCarma. Our analytics suite of products 
Table of Contents

utilizes a wide range of data resources and analytical techniques to determine current and future traffic patterns, permitting the effective performance analysis and management of traffic infrastructure resources, whether at the intersection level, arterial and corridor level, or highway level. This information can then be analyzed by traffic professionals to measure how a transportation network is performing and to identify potential areas of improvement. These applications are also capable of providing users with predictive traffic analytics, and easy-to-use visualization and animation features based on historical traffic conditions.
This segment also includes our commercial vehicle operations and vehicle safety compliance platforms, known as "ClearFleet", "CVIEW-Plus", "CheckPoint", "UCRLink" and "Inspect". These software applications support state-based commercial vehicle operations by storing and distributing intrastate and interstate commercial vehicle information for local, state and federal agencies' roadside and enforcement operations.
Our Transportation Systems segment is largely dependent upon state and local governmental funding, and to a lesser extent federal governmental funding. In addition, various other funding mechanisms exist to support transportation infrastructure and related projects, including, but not limited to, bonds, dedicated sales and gas tax measures, and other alternative funding sources. We believe the overall expansion of our Transportation Systems segment in the future will continue to be dependent at least in part on the federal and local government's use of funds, and as in the past, our Transportation Systems business has been, at times, adversely affected by governmental budgetary issues. Delays in the allocation of funds may prolong uncertainty regarding the allotment of transportation funds in federal, state and local budgets.
Sales and Marketing
We currently sell our Roadway Sensors products through both direct and indirect sales channels. In the territories we sell through direct channels, we use a combination of our own sales personnel and outside sales organizations to sell, oversee installations, and support our products. Our indirect sales channel comprises a network of independent distributors in the U.S. and select international locations, which sell integrated systems and related products to the traffic management market. Our independent distributors are trained in and primarily responsible for the sales, installation, set-up and support of our products. They maintain an inventory of demonstration traffic products from various manufacturers, and sell directly to government agencies and installation contractors. These distributors often have long-term arrangements with local government agencies in their respective territories for the supply of various products for the construction and renovation of traffic intersections, and are generally well-known suppliers of various high-quality ITS products to the traffic management market. We periodically hold technical training classes for our distributors and end users, and maintain a full-time staff of customer support technicians throughout the U.S. to provide technical assistance when needed. When appropriate, we have the ability to modify or make changes to our distributor network to accommodate the needs of the market and our customer base.
We market and sell our Transportation Systems services and solutions primarily to government agencies pursuant to negotiated contracts that involve competitive bidding and specific qualification requirements. Most of our contracts are with federal, state and local municipal customers, and generally provide for cancellation or renegotiation at the option of the customer upon reasonable notice and fees paid for modification. We generally use selected members of our engineering, science and information technology teams on a regional basis to serve in sales and business development functions. Our Transportation Systems contracts generally involve long lead times and require extensive specification development, evaluation and price negotiations.
With the acquisition of the TrafficCast Business on December 7, 2020, we expanded our customer segments to now sell traffic and mobility data and software through a direct sales model to commercial enterprises, such as media companies involved in providing real-time traffic data and traffic incident data to both automotive OEMs and the traveling public. 
We have historically had a diverse customer base. For Fiscal 2021 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020"), no individual customer represented greater than 10% of our total revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 ("Fiscal 2019"), one individual customer represented greater than 10% of our total revenues. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our total trade accounts receivable.
Manufacturing and Materials
We use contract manufacturers to build subassemblies that are used in our Roadway Sensors products. Additionally, we procure certain components for our Roadway Sensors products from qualified suppliers, both in the U.S. and internationally, and generally use multi-sourcing strategies when technically and economically feasible to mitigate supply risk. These subassemblies and components are typically delivered to our Santa Ana, California facility where they go through final assembly and testing prior to shipment to our customers. Our key suppliers include Veris Manufacturing and MoboTrex, Inc. Our manufacturing activities are conducted in approximately 9,000 square feet of space at our Santa Ana, California facility. Production volume at our subcontractors is based upon quarterly forecasts that we generally adjust on a monthly basis to control 
Table of Contents

inventory levels. Typically, we do not manufacture any of the hardware used in the transportation management and traveler information systems that we design and implement. Our production facility maintains a Quality Management System that is currently certified as conforming to all requirements of the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 9001:2015 international standard.
Customer Support and Services
We provide warranty service and support for our products, as well as follow-up service and support for which we charge separately. Such service revenue was not a material portion of our total revenues for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019. We believe customer support is a key competitive factor for our Company.
Backlog
Our total backlog of unfulfilled firm orders was approximately $78.1 million at March 31, 2021, which included $66.5 million related to Transportation Systems and $11.6 million related to Roadway Sensors. We expect to recognize revenue of approximately 73% of our Transportation Systems and 27% of our Roadway Sensors backlog including TrafficCast's commercial business as of the end of a fiscal year in the subsequent fiscal year. At March 31, 2020, we had backlog of approximately $62.1 million, which included $53.4 million related to Transportation Systems and $8.7 million related to Roadway Sensors. The increase in backlog in the current fiscal year was largely due to the additions of TrafficCast backlog of approximately $10.6 million and a slight increase in Transportation Systems backlog due to a few larger contracts.
Backlog is an operational measure representing future unearned revenue amounts believed to be firm that are to be earned under our existing agreements and are not included in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Backlog does not include announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed. We believe backlog is a useful metric for investors, given its relevance to total orders.
The timing and realization of our backlog is subject to the inherent uncertainties of doing business with federal, state and local governments, particularly in view of budgetary constraints, cut-backs and other delays or reallocations of funding that these entities typically face. In addition, pursuant to the customary terms of our agreements with government contractors and other customers, our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders with little or no penalties. Lead times for the release of purchase orders often depend upon the scheduling and forecasting practices of our individual customers, which also can affect the timing of the conversion of our backlog into revenues. For these reasons, among others, our backlog at a particular date may not be indicative of our future revenues, in particular for our Roadway Sensors segment.
Product Development
Our product development activities are mostly conducted at our principal facility in Santa Ana, California, as well as our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin and Oakland, California. Our research and development costs and expenses were approximately $5.1 million for Fiscal 2021, $4.3 million for Fiscal 2020, and $3.8 million for Fiscal 2019. We expect to continue to pursue various product development programs and incur research and development expenditures in both our Roadway Sensors and Transportation Systems segments in future periods.
We believe our engineering and product development capabilities are a competitive strength. We strive to continuously develop new products, technologies, features and functionalities to meet the needs of our ever-changing markets, as well as to enhance, improve upon, and refine our existing product lines. We plan to continue to invest in the development of further enhancement and functionality of our ClearMobility Platform, which includes among other things our software offering in our Transportation Systems segment, as well as our Vantage products family in our Roadway Sensors segment.
During Fiscal 2020, we successfully released ClearGuide, our state-of-the-art transportation performance measures solution, designed to help transportation agencies achieve safer, more efficient mobility for their networks. Certain development costs were capitalized into intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets; however, certain costs did not meet the criteria for capitalization under GAAP and are included in research and development expense. Going forward, we expect to continue to invest in our solutions. This continued investment may result in increases in research and development costs, as well as additional capitalized software in future periods.
Competition
Generally, we face significant competition in each of our target markets. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Table of Contents

In the market for our Roadway Sensors detection products, we compete with manufacturers and distributors of other above-ground video camera and radar detection systems and manufacturers and distributors of other non-intrusive detection devices (e.g., microwave, infrared, radar, ultrasonic and magnetic detectors), as well as manufacturers and installers of in-pavement inductive loop products, which have historically been, and currently continue to be, the predominant vehicle detection system in this market. Additionally, products such as Velocity, BlueTOAD and VantagePegasus compete against various competitors in the travel-time and data communications markets, respectively.
The markets in which our Transportation Systems segment operates is highly fragmented and subject to evolving national and regional quality, operations and safety standards. Our competitors vary in number, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. Our competitors in the managed services and consulting business lines include a mix of local, regional and international engineering services firms. Our competitors in the software business line (e.g., performance measurement and management, advanced traveler information systems, and our commercial vehicle operations and vehicle safety compliance platforms) include university affiliated software organizations, venture backed software companies, as well as other multi-disciplinary hardware and software corporations.
In general, the markets for the products and services we offer are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. Many of our current and prospective competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources than we. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging standards or technologies, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. It is also possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We believe that our ability to compete effectively in our target markets will depend on a number of factors, including the success and timing of our new product development, the compatibility of our products with a broad range of computing systems, product quality and performance, reliability, functionality, price and service, and technical support. Our failure to provide services and develop and market products that compete successfully with those of other suppliers and consultants in our target markets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology. Our policy is to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for any potentially significant new technology acquired or developed by us. We currently have a total of 25 issued U.S. patents, including: (i) 15 relating to our Roadway Sensors technologies, (ii) 7 relating to our Transportation Systems technologies and (iii) 3 related to our purchase of the TrafficCast Business. We had a total of 2 pending patent applications in the U.S. We currently have 3 issued foreign patents and 2 foreign patent applications related to our purchase of the TrafficCast Business. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2026 to 2039. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
In addition to patent laws, we rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers and suppliers, proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants, and other similar measures. We do not have any material licenses or trademarks other than those relating to product names. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe our patents, patent applications, software and other proprietary know-how have value, rapidly evolving technology makes our future success dependent largely upon our ability to successfully achieve continuing innovation.
Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our proprietary rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend us against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. An adverse outcome in such litigation or similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require us to cease marketing or using certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of addressing any intellectual property litigation claim, both in legal fees and expenses, as well as from the diversion of management's resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employees
As of March 31, 2021, we employed 415 full-time employees and 24 part-time employees, for a total of 439 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Table of Contents

Government Regulation
Our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those restricting the discharge of materials into the environment. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations. We continue to expend funds in connection with our compliance with applicable environmental regulations. These expenditures have not, however, been significant in the past, and we do not expect any significant expenditure in the near future. Currently, compliance with foreign laws has not had a material impact on our business; however, as we expand internationally, foreign laws and regulations could have a material impact on our business in the future.
