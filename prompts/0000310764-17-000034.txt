ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

Making healthcare better is at the heart of what Stryker does. We do this by collaborating with our customers to develop innovative products and services that ultimately improve patients' lives. Our core values guide our behaviors and actions and are fundamental to how Stryker executes its mission. 
We are a global leader in medical technology with 2016 net sales of $11,325 and net earnings of $1,647. Our products include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other products used in a variety of medical specialties.
Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several orthopaedic products. In the United States most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Our products are sold in over 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors.
As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "Stryker," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Stryker Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Business Segments and Geographic Information
We segregate our operations into three reportable business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine. Financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Notes 10 and 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Orthopaedics
Orthopaedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremity surgeries. We bring patients and physicians advanced implant designs and specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and 


recovery simpler, faster and more effective. We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques. In 2015 we received clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our Mako total knee application. This expands our Mako product offerings of partial knee and total hip applications to provide a comprehensive solution in the robotic arm-assisted reconstructive surgery line. We anticipate the full commercial launch of our Mako total knee application in 2017.
Stryker is one of four leading global competitors for joint replacement and trauma products; the other three being Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), DePuy Synthes (a Johnson & Johnson company) and Smith & Nephew plc (Smith & Nephew).

In 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products. In November 2014 we entered into a settlement agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had surgery to replace their Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems prior to November 3, 2014, and in December 2016 the settlement program was extended to patients who had revision surgery prior to December 19, 2016. To date we have recorded charges to earnings totaling $1,968 ($2,200 before $232 of insurance recoveries) representing the actuarially determined low end of the range of probable loss to resolve this entire matter globally. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
MedSurg
MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments), endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy), patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products (Medical), reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices (Sustainability) and other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.

In 2015 the New England Journal of Medicine released results of a study finding that intra-arterial treatment to remove stroke-causing blood clots provides better outcomes than using a clot dissolving drug. One of the devices used in this study was our Trevo™ Retriever. Medical professionals in the field believe that the study's results will change the practice of acute stroke treatments. Stryker's Trevo™ Retriever is a leading device in the market that allows physicians to visualize blood clot interaction during treatment. In 2016 the FDA expanded the indication for the Trevo™ Retriever as a front-line treatment to reduce paralysis, speech difficulties and other stroke disabilities in patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke. Trevo™ is the first thrombectomy device to receive this expanded indication.
Geographic Areas
In 2016 approximately 73% of our net sales were generated from customers in the United States. Additional geographic information is included under "Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this report and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Raw Materials and Inventory
Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources; however, certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers. Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order. The dollar amount of 


backlog orders at any given time is not meaningful to an understanding of our business taken as a whole.
Patents and Trademarks
Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage. On December 31, 2016 we owned approximately 2,184 United States patents and approximately 3,454 international patents.
Seasonality
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.
Competition
In each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business. Competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces.
We believe our commitment to innovation, quality and service and our reputation differentiate us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enable us to compete effectively. We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. 
Product Development
Most of our products and product improvements were developed internally at research facilities in the United States, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Sweden and Switzerland. We also invest through acquisitions in technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which we operate. We maintain close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist us in product development efforts. The total costs of research, development and engineering activities were $715, $625 and $614 in 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
Regulation
Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.
In the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products. Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them. Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications.
The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our

facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.
The member states of the European Union (EU) adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products. We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products. In addition, we comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries in which we market our products.
Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies, and the resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Employees
On December 31, 2016 we had approximately 33,000 employees globally. The number of employees increased from 2015 largely due to our Sage and Physio acquisitions. Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain positive relationships with our employees globally.
