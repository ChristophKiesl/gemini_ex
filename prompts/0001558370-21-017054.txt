8




are focused on using our proprietary technology to pursue the following four significant industry applications, each of which we believe is important to the achievement of the global energy transition currently underway:
​

• | Distributed generation (commercially available);
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Distributed hydrogen (commercially available);
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Solid oxide based long-duration hydrogen energy storage and electrolysis (under development); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Carbon capture (under development), carbon separation and utilization (commercially available).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
See the section below entitled “Our Product Platforms and Applications” for more information.
​
Our Market Opportunity
​
​
Climate initiatives are driving the global push to reduce greenhouse gases, including CO2, nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and sulfur oxides (“SOx”). We believe there exists a large and increasing total addressable market opportunity for FuelCell Energy given the solutions we have commercially available today and the solutions that are in development for commercialization, which are focused on addressing global climate change, air quality, emissions, and the need for resilient and reliable power.
​
Through the unique capabilities of our platforms, we can isolate and remove CO2 from exhaust streams, provide distributed hydrogen cost effectively to further advance the transportation industry’s shift to hydrogen powered vehicles, and provide industrial and utility customers with a secure and local supply of hydrogen. Hydrogen is also an effective medium for the storage of energy, and we are positioned to provide a highly efficient and environmentally favorable hydrogen-based long-duration energy storage solution. We believe hydrogen-based storage is environmentally superior to a mineral-based storage solution such as lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, through the deployment of our megawatt and sub-megawatt platform solutions, we can deliver the benefits of clean distributed power generation, including the desirable value stream of thermal energy, and avoid the need for massive, long distance transmission infrastructure and the risks that the traditional transmission grid creates.
​
See the section below entitled “Our Markets” for information regarding our existing and target markets.

​
Our Business Strategy and Business Updates
​
In 2019, we launched our “Powerhouse” strategy to strengthen our business, maximize operational efficiencies and position us for future growth focused on three key pillars – “Transform, Strengthen and Grow.” 
​
Summary – Fiscal Year 2021 Business Updates
​
We made substantial progress in achieving the key initiatives reflected in the “Transform” and “Strengthen” phases of our strategy in fiscal year 2021. This included raising capital in the equity markets during the fiscal year and the repayment of $82.3 million of debt obligations under our now extinguished credit facility with Orion Energy Partners Investment Agent, LLC and its affiliated lenders and the payment of $21.5 million to satisfy in full our obligations under the terms of the preferred stock of our Canadian subsidiary, FCE FuelCell Energy, Ltd. We ended fiscal year 2021 with an unrestricted cash balance of $432.2 million compared to an unrestricted cash balance of $149.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2020. 
​
From an operations perspective, we consistently increased our factory production rates during the year in order to meet our backlog requirements and are currently operating at a 45 MW per year annualized production rate on a single production shift. In addition, we continued to build out our generation backlog, with our San Bernardino project reaching commercial operations in the third quarter of our fiscal year and our Groton and LIPA Yaphank projects nearing commercial operations as the date of this report. We also invested in improving fleet performance during the year with additional module deployments and maintenance activities. 
​
From a research and development perspective, we increased our activities around commercializing our solid oxide platforms and demonstrated higher electrical efficiency hydrogen production with our solid oxide electrolysis platform at our headquarters in Connecticut. Additionally, we continued our joint research with EMRE on fuel cell carbon capture solutions and recently extended our joint development agreement with EMRE through April 2022. We also invested in improvement initiatives with respect to our core molten carbonate technology in response to issues we were seeing in the field. We identified improvement opportunities ranging from improved thermal management by reducing internal temperature to improving the performance of our electrical balance of plant and began to implement design changes to our commercial platforms which are expected to improve overall product performance. Specific to our stack modules, these improvements centered around delivering more uniform temperature distribution within the stack modules with the intent of improving output over the life of the modules to achieve the product’s expected design life.
​
Finally, from a human capital perspective, we strengthened our team across the Company and added key leadership positions including a Chief People Officer and a Chief Marketing Officer. Our global headcount stood at 382 employees as of October 31, 2021 compared to 316 employees as of October 31, 2020. With the foundational execution in fiscal year 2021 and growth initiatives planned for fiscal year 2022, we expect to continue to expand our global team. 
​

​
Our Sustainability Commitment 
​
Our platforms have a direct impact on reducing the global environmental footprint of baseload power generation. However, our platforms do not stop at power delivery as they are designed to go beyond power, delivering hydrogen, carbon separation, water, and thermal energy in various applications. As a result of our platforms’ ability to deliver multiple value streams, we help our customers reduce their emissions on-site without buying remote carbon/environmental offsets. In the future, we plan to commercialize our hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and carbon capture technologies intended to drive next generation solutions to help customers attain their decarbonization goals. 
​
Our patented products offer a sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion-based power generation. Traditional power plants create harmful emissions, such as NOx, SOx and particulate matter, that are a serious public health concern and have a direct impact on the communities in which these plants operate. Alternatively, our power platforms use a combustion-free power generation process that is virtually free of pollutants. Our platforms are highly efficient and environmentally friendly products that support the “Triple Bottom Line” concept of sustainability, consisting of environmental, social, and economic considerations. 
​
As an enterprise, we are proud that, in October 2018, we were certified ISO 14001:2015 compliant, having demonstrated the establishment of and adherence to an environmental management system standard. We believe that we are the only fuel cell manufacturer to have received this certification.
Our commitment to sustainability is also evident in the design, manufacturing, installation and on-going servicing of our fuel cell power platforms, which are engineered for recycling and re-use. We start with a commitment to sustainability best practices as part of our corporate culture, then apply this core belief to the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our fuel cell power platforms. For example, when our plants reach the end of their useful lives, we have the capability to refurbish and re-use certain parts and also recycle most of what we cannot re-use. This is a departure from other combustion-based power generation methods that typically produce a significant amount of unrecyclable waste which increases landfill use. The balance of plant (“BOP”) is designed to have an operating life of 25-to-30 years, at which time metals such as steel and copper are reclaimed for scrap value. For context, by weight, approximately 93% of the entire power plant can be re-used or recycled at the end of its useful life.


​
Our Current Products
Our core fuel cell products offer clean, highly efficient and affordable power generation for customers. The plants are scalable for multi-megawatt utility applications, microgrid applications, distributed hydrogen, or use of the platform’s thermal attributes for on-site heat and chilling applications for a broad range of applications.

Our commercial product line includes:

● | SureSource1500™, our 1.4 MW platform;
--+--------------------------------------


● | SureSource 3000™ , our 2.8 MW platform;
--+----------------------------------------


● | SureSource 4000™, our 3.7 MW high efficiency platform;

--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | SureSource Hydrogen™, our 2.3 MW platform that is designed to produce up to 1,200 kg of hydrogen per day.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ​
Our global SureSource product line is uniformly based on the same carbonate fuel cell technology, and offers the following advantages:
​

● | Sustainable: With the commercialization of our solid oxide platform, we will be able to offer two highly differentiated high temperature platforms. Our solutions produce electricity electrochemically − without combustion – which enables siting of the power plants within dense, urban areas with clean air permitting regulations and represents an important public health benefit. Fuel cells also reduce carbon emissions compared to less efficient combustion-based power generation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Flexible: Our solutions can operate on renewable natural gas, on-site renewable biogas, directed biogas, natural gas, flare gas and propane to offer combined heat and power (“CHP”) and are scalable to add power incrementally as demand grows. The unique chemistry of our carbonate fuel cells allows them to directly use low Btu on-site biogas with no reduction in output or efficiency compared to operation on natural gas. We have developed proprietary biogas cleanup and contaminant monitoring equipment which, combined with the inherent suitability of the carbonate fuel cell chemistry, gives us an advantage in on-site biogas applications. In addition, we have demonstrated operation of our carbonate fuel cell technology with other fuel sources including coal syngas and propane. We believe oil and gas companies and new market entrants will continue to develop and increase the supply of renewable natural gas which would benefit our customers given the fuel flexibility of our platforms.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Reliable: Our solutions improve power reliability and energy security by lessening reliance on the transmission and distribution infrastructure of the electric grid. Unlike solar and wind power, fuel cells are able to operate continuously regardless of weather, time of day, or geographic location.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Standardized: Our solutions use a standard cell design globally, enabling supply chain volume-based cost reduction, optimal resource utilization and long-life product enhancements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Attractive Thermal Attributes: In addition to electricity, our standard fuel cell configuration produces high quality thermal energy (approximately 700° F), suitable for heating facilities or water, or steam for industrial processes or for absorption cooling. The high value may allow customers to reduce or eliminate their burning of fuel in carbon intensive boilers. When configured for CHP, our system efficiencies can potentially reach up to 90%, depending on the application. When configured for distributed hydrogen, our plants produce hydrogen in addition to power, with a potential effective efficiency (counting the fuel that would have been used to produce hydrogen conventionally) of up to 80% before considering waste heat utilization, which can raise the total efficiency even higher.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Use of Readily Available Catalyst Material: As our fuel cells are designed to operate at approximately 1,100° F, our platform solution has a key advantage afforded high temperature fuel cells, specifically that they do not require the use of geographically limited precious metal electrodes required by lower temperature fuel cells, such as proton exchange membrane (“PEM”) and alkaline (“AFC”) fuel cells. As a result, we are able to use less expensive and more readily available industrial metals, primarily nickel and stainless steel, as catalysts for our fuel cell components.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Easy to Site: Our fuel cell power platforms are easily sited with a relatively small footprint given the amount of power produced, allowing our platforms to be located at the point of demand. They require significantly less land than solar and wind projects. There is minimal noise produced by the mechanical BOP and a clean emissions profile, making our fuel cell power platforms ideally suited for urban locations and in building suburban applications at or near the point of energy consumption. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




​

● | Scalable: Our solutions are scalable, providing a cost-effective solution to adding power incrementally as demand grows, such as multi-megawatt fuel cell parks supporting the electric grid and large scale commercial and industrial operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Product Efficiency
The electrical efficiency of our carbonate fuel cell solutions ranges from approximately 47% to 60% upon initial operations of our platforms depending on the configuration. When configured for CHP, our system efficiencies can potentially reach up to 90%, depending on the application. Our solutions are designed to deliver high electrical efficiency where the power is used, avoiding transmission. Transmission line losses average about 5% for the U.S. grid, which represents inefficiency, results in additional emissions, and is a hidden cost to ratepayers. In addition, overhead transmission lines have contributed to the ignition of wildfires in certain geographies.
​
Our Product Platforms and Applications
We are focused on using our proprietary technology to pursue the following four significant industry applications: 
​

• | Distributed generation (commercially available);
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Distributed hydrogen (commercially available);
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Solid oxide based long-duration hydrogen energy storage and electrolysis (under development); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Carbon capture (under development), carbon separation and utilization (commercially available).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Distributed Generation
​
Our proprietary, patented SureSource platforms generate electricity directly from a hydrogen-rich fuel, such as natural gas or biogas. This multi-fuel capability enables the SureSource platform to leverage the established natural gas infrastructure that is readily available in our existing and target markets, compared to some types of fuel cells that can only operate on high purity hydrogen. Our proprietary technology also allows us to utilize on-site biogas and renewable natural gas, the application of which is rapidly expanding around the world, to fuel our platforms.
​
We market different configurations and applications of our SureSource platform to meet specific market needs, including:
​

• | On-Site Power (Behind the Meter): Customers benefit from improved power reliability and energy security from on-site power that reduces reliance on the electric grid in an environmentally responsible manner. Additionally, thermal energy produced by our fuel cells can be used to produce hot water or steam or to drive high efficiency absorption chillers for cooling applications for commercial and industrial customers. The SureSource platform can also deliver hydrogen and carbon dioxide for beverage and food production in addition to other industrial uses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Utility Grid Support: Our SureSource power platforms are scalable, enabling multiple fuel cell platforms to be located together on a very small footprint per MW generated. This capability enables utilities to add multi-megawatt power generation to enhance electric grid resiliency where needed, without the associated cost, inefficiencies of a transmission system, and other associated above-ground risk. Our fuel cells can solidify the total utility power generation solution when combined with intermittent sources, such as solar or wind, or less efficient combustion-based equipment that provides peaking or load following power.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Microgrid Applications: SureSource platforms can also be configured as a microgrid, either independently or with other forms of power generation, with the goal of providing continuous power and a seamless transition during times of grid outages. We have deployed multiple microgrids leveraging our platform solutions, some individually and some integrated with other forms of power generation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Distributed Hydrogen
​
SureSource platforms are configurable to deliver on-site hydrogen for transportation, industrial applications, natural gas blending, and repowering combustion-based equipment with zero carbon hydrogen. The SureSource Hydrogen platform utilizes proprietary fuel cells configured to simultaneously generate three value streams — power generation, hydrogen, 

14




and water. When operated on biogas or renewable natural gas, SureSource Hydrogen systems produce renewable hydrogen, also known as Green Hydrogen, but, even when fueled with natural gas, our platforms produce hydrogen with a lower carbon and criteria pollutant impact when compared to conventional steam methane reforming (“SMR”) applications because of the use of internal heat instead of burning fuel to provide heat for reforming and steam generation. Heat and steam are byproducts of fuel cell operation, allowing Trigeneration platforms to produce hydrogen without water consumption (in fact with net water production) and with a low carbon footprint. Adding carbon separation or carbon capture to the SureSource Hydrogen platform when fueled with natural gas will deliver Blue Hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen produced with carbon capture). The following figure illustrates the concept of the SureSource Hydrogen platform and identifies typical applications for our distributed hydrogen application.

Trigeneration Distributed Hydrogen Platform
​
Additionally, we are in the process of commercializing a solution based on our SureSource platform that is designed to produce hydrogen through Reformer-Electrolyzer-Purifier operation (“REP”). REP combines reforming and electrolysis into one unit based on our carbonate fuel cell platform, with the hydrogen output being produced from natural gas and water. The economics of the REP system have the potential to be highly attractive for distributed hydrogen in certain markets and could provide competitive distributed hydrogen for many applications in the near-term. Adding carbon separation or carbon capture to the SureSource REP platform when fueled with natural gas will deliver Blue Hydrogen. 
​
​
Long Duration Hydrogen-Based Energy Storage and Electrolysis
​
We are in the process of commercializing a solution for long duration energy storage using our proprietary solid oxide electrolysis technology which is expected to enable production of hydrogen with high electrical efficiency. We believe that our platform will deliver higher efficiency than other competitors and competing technologies with or without the addition of waste heat. 
​
Our solid oxide stacks are designed to alternate between electrolysis and power generation mode, with one of our design goals being better integration of the intermittent power generation sources of wind and solar into the modern electrical 

15




grid via long duration storage of energy. Hydrogen-based long duration energy storage has the ability to transform the way intermittent resources are supported with combustion energy sources for continuous power. Instead of producing power from fuel and air, a solid oxide fuel cell stack in electrolysis mode splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using supplied electricity. The hydrogen can be stored as compressed gas, creating the ability to produce a virtually limitless supply. When the grid needs to discharge power, the stored hydrogen will be sent back to the same solid oxide stacks, which react it with air to produce power and to regenerate the water, which will be stored for the next cycle. 
​
Long duration hydrogen-based energy storage can be achieved without the need to add excessive amounts of conventional battery capacity, a capacity that is reliant on rare earth minerals such as Lithium and Cobalt, both of which have supply constraints for broad adoption, require extensive mining and present long-term disposal challenges post-use. Long duration hydrogen-based energy storage is expected to be required at large scale in order to manage the forecasted high penetration of intermittent renewable resources globally, and this water/hydrogen-based approach of our solid oxide fuel cell/solid oxide electrolysis cell/reversible solid oxide fuel cell technology has the potential to be a key enabler of long duration hydrogen-based energy storage. We believe hydrogen as an energy storage medium is superior to mineral-based storage platforms.
​
We are also developing advanced electrolysis systems based on our solid oxide electrolysis platform, which can operate at higher electrical efficiency than currently available electrolysis technologies. Applications for this technology include hydrogen for production for mobility, industrial users, repowering existing combustion generation assets, as well as large scale hydrogen production from curtailed renewable or nuclear power. 
​
We are currently operating a sub scale demonstration project of this technology in our Danbury test facility and have been awarded a pilot program to provide a packaged 150 kg/day system for demonstration at Idaho National Laboratory which we expect to be placed in service during 2022. 
​
Carbon Capture, Separation and Utilization
​

• | Carbon Capture – Power generation and industrial applications are the source of two-thirds of the world’s carbon emissions. Cost effective and efficient carbon capture from these two applications globally represents a large market because it could enable clean use of all available fuels. The SureSource CaptureTM system is being designed to separate and concentrate CO2 from the flue gases of natural gas, biomass or coal-fired power plants or other industrial facilities as a side reaction that extracts and purifies the CO2 in the flue gas during the power generation process and destroys approximately 70% of NOx emissions during the power generation process. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The production of additional power during the carbon capture process, as opposed to consuming power, differentiates the SureSource Capture system from other forms of carbon capture. This added revenue attribute could make the SureSource Capture system more cost effective than other systems which are being considered for carbon capture. SureSource Capture systems can be implemented incrementally, managing capital outlay to match decarbonization objectives and regulatory requirements. Since our solution generates a return on capital resulting from the fuel cell's production of electricity compared to an increase in operating expense required by other carbon capture technologies, it can extend the life of existing power plants and be economically applied to industrial thermal systems. 
​
We have a Joint Development Agreement with EMRE which was effective October 31, 2019 and executed in fiscal year 2020 (as amended from time to time, the “EMRE Joint Development Agreement”). Under this agreement, we have engaged in exclusive research and development efforts with EMRE to evaluate and develop new and/or improved carbonate fuel cells to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and power sources. Effective as of October 31, 2021, we entered into a six-month extension to the EMRE Joint Development Agreement which allows for the continuation of research intended to enable incorporation of design improvements to our current fuel cell design with the goal of using such improvements in a future demonstration of the technology for capturing carbon. The term of the EMRE Joint Development Agreement will now continue until April 30, 2022. 
​

● | Carbon Separation and Utilization – In addition to the ability to capture carbon dioxide from an external source, we are adding the capability to our platforms to extract and purify carbon dioxide produced by the fuel

cell power generation process. Our carbon separation technology allows carbon dioxide to be easily extracted and purified to the appropriate level for utilization or sequestration, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the generated power from our fuel cell platforms. This requires a simple modification to the fuel cell module which can be incorporated into new platforms as well as retrofitted for existing systems. Over time as we replace fuel cell stacks in our deployed modules, we intended to integrate our carbon separation technology. One attractive application for this technology is the on-site production of carbon dioxide for use in beverage and food production, in addition to other uses such as pH balancing of water, the production of dry ice, as a binder in cement production, utilization in grow houses, the production of ethanol and numerous other industrial applications. The ability to provide clean power, heat, and useable carbon dioxide is a unique feature profile that we believe is only available with our SureSource platform. Our systems are modular and scalable, so they can be deployed in a wide variety of applications where on-site carbon dioxide is consumed as a product solution, or carbon dioxide is delivered to multiple nearby consumers. An illustration of the carbon separation application is shown in the following figure, which also shows potential applications for locally produced carbon dioxide.

Our Business Model
​
Our business model is based on multiple revenue streams, including power platform and component sales; recurring service revenue, mainly through long-term service agreements; recurring electricity, capacity, and renewable energy credit sales under power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) and tariffs for projects we retain in our generation operating portfolio; and revenue from public and private industry research contracts related to the development of our Advanced Technologies which are discussed in more detail below. 
​
We are a complete solutions provider, controlling the design, manufacturing, sales, installation, operations, and maintenance of our patented fuel cell technology under long-term power purchase and service agreements. When utilizing long-term PPAs, the end-user of the power or utility hosts the installation and only pays for power as it is delivered, avoiding up-front capital investment. We also develop projects and sell equipment directly to customers, providing a complete solution of engineering, installing, and servicing the fuel cell power plant under an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement (“EPC”) and a long-term maintenance and service agreement. (See the sections below entitled “Engineering, Procurement and Construction” and “Service and Warranty Agreements” for more information.) We maintain the long-term recurring service obligation and associated revenues running conterminous with the life of such projects.
Historically, in the United States, customers or developers typically purchased our fuel cell power plants outright.  As the size of our fuel cell projects has grown and the availability of project capital has improved, project structures in the U.S. have transitioned to predominantly PPAs. Customers and developers generally have the option to either purchase our fuel cell platforms outright or enter into a PPA under which the customer or developer (i.e. the end-user of the power) commits to purchase power as it is produced for an extended period of time, typically 10 to 20 years. We may elect to retain ownership of a project or we may elect to sell all or some of the project to a third party. If a project or project asset is sold, revenue from the sale is recognized and reflected in the Product revenues line item of our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, and we recognize revenue separately for the long-term maintenance and service agreement with respect to the project over the term of that agreement. If a project is retained, we recognize electricity, capacity and/or renewable energy credits monthly over the term of the PPA. We report the financial performance of retained projects as Generation revenues and cost of generation revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
Our decision to retain certain projects is based in part on the recurring, predictable cash flows these projects can offer us, the proliferation of PPAs in the industry and the potential access to capital.  Retaining PPAs affords us the full benefit of future cash flows under the PPAs, which are expected to be higher than if we sell the projects, although it requires more upfront capital investment and financing.  As of October 31, 2021, our operating portfolio of retained projects totaled 34.0 MW with an additional 41.3 MW under development or construction. We plan to continue to grow this portfolio prudently and in a balanced manner, while also selling projects to customers or project investors when selling presents the best value and opportunity for our capital needs or meets the customer’s desired ownership structure.
​
We operate and maintain our project platforms for the life of the project regardless of the ownership structure. For all operating fuel cell platforms not operating under a PPA, customers enter into long-term service agreements with us, some of which have terms of up to 20 years. We report the revenue earned under long-term maintenance and service agreements as Service agreements and license revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
​
Internationally, South Korea and Europe have historically been product sale markets for the Company; however, we have not recognized meaningful product sales revenues in these geographies since 2018. Our activities in South Korea have been impacted by our prior dispute with POSCO Energy and, until fiscal year 2021, we moderated our investment in business development in Europe due to limited resources. Increasing product sales is a focus area for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. As a result of entering into a settlement agreement with POSCO Energy and its subsidiary, Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (“KFC”), on December 20, 2021 (the “Settlement Agreement”), we have confirmed our full access to the South Korean and broader Asian markets for sales of our products and plan to aggressively pursue sales in these markets, which we see as key to our future growth. (See the section below entitled “License Agreements and Royalty Income; Relationship with POSCO Energy – License Agreements and Disputes with POSCO Energy; Settlement Agreement” for more information related to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.)

Advanced Technologies Programs
Our Advanced Technologies programs include research and development or demonstration programs funded by third parties. We undertake both privately funded and publicly funded research and development to develop and grow these opportunities, reduce product and output costs, and expand our technology portfolio. Our Advanced Technologies programs are currently focused on developing and commercializing solutions that advance solid oxide fuel cells, distributed hydrogen, and carbon capture. We report the revenue earned under these programs as Advanced Technologies contract revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
​
We have historically worked on technology development with various U.S. government departments and agencies, including the DOE, the Department of Defense (“DOD”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”), the Office of Naval Research (“ONR”), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”). Government funding, principally from the DOE, provided 8%, 9% and 6% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
​
We have been working with EMRE since 2013 to develop and commercialize our carbon capture solution which is an application of our core carbonate technology. 
​
Beyond the DOE and EMRE funding, we intend to prudently invest capital to accelerate commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells, carbon capture and separation, long-duration energy storage, and REP solutions, as discussed below in more detail in the section entitled “Company Funded Research and Development”. 

​
Company Funded Research and Development
In addition to research and development performed under research contracts, including, as described under the heading “Advanced Technologies Programs” above, we also fund our own research and development activities to support the commercial fleet with product enhancements and improvements. We work to continuously improve and mature our products and implement lessons learned into our product designs and manufacturing process subsequent to introduction. We also invest in improvement initiatives with respect to our core molten carbonate technology. Recently, we identified improvement opportunities ranging from improved thermal management by reducing internal temperature to improving the performance of our electrical balance of plant and began to implement design changes to our commercial platforms which are expected to improve overall product performance. As it relates to our fuel cell modules, these improvements centered around delivering more uniform temperature distribution within the stack modules with the intent of improving output over the life of the modules to achieve the product’s expected design life. Continued extension of design life and output of our modules over time is a core research and development focus. In addition, we are also investing in commercializing technologies such as carbon capture and separation, REP, solid oxide fuel cells, and solid oxide electrolysis cells for hydrogen production and energy storage as we believe these technologies represent significant future market opportunities. 
Company funded research and development is included in Research and development expenses (operating expenses) in our consolidated financial statements. The total research and development expenditures in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, including third party and Company-funded expenditures, are as follows:

Our Markets
We target distinct markets and applications, including:


● | Utilities and independent power producers;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Industrial and process applications;
--+-------------------------------------


● | Education and health care;
--+---------------------------


● | Data centers and communication;
--+--------------------------------

● | Food and beverage.
--+-------------------

The utilities and independent power producers market has historically been our largest market with customers that include utilities on the East and West coasts of the United States, such as UIL Holdings Corporation, Inc. (owned by Avangrid, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Iberdrola), the Long Island Power Authority (“LIPA”) and Southern California Edison. In Europe, utility customers include E.ON Connecting Energies, one of the largest utilities in the world. In South Korea, we are contracted to operate and maintain a 20 MW power plant project (comprised of five SureSource 3000 plants) for Korea Southern Power Company (“KOSPO”). 
Our SureSource power platforms are producing power for a variety of industrial, commercial, municipal and government customers, including manufacturing facilities, pharmaceutical processing facilities, universities, healthcare facilities and wastewater treatment facilities. These institutions expect efficient, clean and continuous power to reduce operating expenses, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid pollutant emissions to meet their sustainability goals, while boosting resiliency and limiting dependence on the distribution grid. CHP applications further support economic and sustainability initiatives by minimizing or avoiding the use of combustion-based boilers for heat. Our SureSource power platforms are unique in their ability to run on biogas. 
Increasing Biogas Application Market Demand
With the growing market for anaerobic digestion (the production of biogas from the breakdown of biodegradable materials in the absence of oxygen) and increasingly stringent regulations regarding air quality, we see a growing market opportunity that is perfectly suited for our fuel cell design. SureSource power platforms operating on biogas are an especially compelling value proposition as they convert a waste product into clean electricity and heat, while reducing or eliminating flaring, which addresses certain economic, environmental justice, and sustainability challenges faced by our customers and the communities in which they operate. 
Biogas is generated by the decay of organic material (i.e., biomass). This decaying organic material releases methane, or biogas. As a harmful greenhouse gas, biogas cannot be released directly into the atmosphere. Flaring creates pollutants and wastes this potential fuel source. Capturing and using biogas as a fuel addresses these challenges and provides a carbon-neutral renewable fuel source. Our patented, proprietary clean-up skid, SureSource TreatmentTM, provides an economical and reliable system for treating biogas for use on-site at the biogas production facility. Examples of producers of biogas as part of their operations include wastewater treatment facilities, food and beverage processors and agricultural operations. 
Our SureSource power platforms convert this biogas into electricity and heat efficiently and economically. Wastewater treatment facilities with anaerobic digesters are an attractive market for our SureSource solution including the power platform as well as treatment of the biogas. Many wastewater treatment plants currently flare biogas produced in the anaerobic digestion process, emitting NOx, SOx and particulate matter into the atmosphere, which does not meet many air quality regulations. Since our fuel cells operate on the biogas produced by the wastewater treatment process and the heat is used to support daily operations at the wastewater treatment facility, the overall thermal efficiency of these installations is high, supporting economics and sustainability. In addition, the fuel cell does not emit the harmful NOx, SOx and particulate matter that come out of a flare or that would result from the use of traditional combustion-based power generation. The unique chemistry of carbonate fuel cells allows them to use low Btu on-site biogas with no reduction in output or efficiency compared to operation on natural gas. We have developed proprietary biogas cleanup and contaminant monitoring equipment which, combined with the inherent suitability of the carbonate fuel cell chemistry, gives us an advantage in on-site biogas applications. Our SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000 power platforms were the first systems certified to California Air Resource Board emissions standards under the Distributed Generation Certification Program for operation with on-site biogas within the state of California.
Microgrid and resiliency applications
Our fuel cell solutions are also well suited for microgrid applications, either as the sole source of power generation or integrated with other forms of power generation. We have fuel cells operating as microgrids at universities and

municipalities, including one university microgrid owned by Clearway Energy and a municipal-based microgrid owned by UIL Holdings Corporation, in addition to the microgrid at a municipal location in Santa Rita, California. For the municipal-based system in Woodbridge, Connecticut owned by UIL Holdings Corporation, under normal operation, the fuel cell supplies power to the grid. If the grid is disrupted, the fuel cell plant will automatically disconnect from the grid and power a number of critical municipal buildings. Heat from this municipal-based fuel cell platform is used by the local high school. Our fuel cell based microgrids have also continued to operate during public safety power shutoffs events in California.
Geographic Market Presence and Market Expansion Targets
We market our products primarily in the United States, Europe and South Korea, and we are also pursuing expanding opportunities in other countries around the world. 
We target for expansion and development markets and geographic regions that:


• | Benefit from and value clean distributed generation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------

​

• | Are located where there are high energy costs, poor grid reliability, and/or challenged transmission and distribution lines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Have a need for distributed hydrogen for transportation or industry;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Can leverage the multiple value streams delivered by our SureSource platforms (electricity, hydrogen, thermal, water, and carbon separation); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Are aligned with regulatory frameworks that harmonize energy, economic and environmental policies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our business model focuses on providing these markets and geographic regions with highly efficient and affordable distributed generation that delivers de-centralized power in a low-carbon, virtually pollutant-free manner. Geographic markets that meet these criteria and where we are already well established include the Northeastern United States and California. We have also installed and are operating plants in Europe and Asia, mainly South Korea, in addition to North America. 
We have made significant progress in reducing costs and creating markets since the commercialization of our products in 2003, with more than 220 MW of our SureSource technology currently installed and operating as of October 31, 2021. 
We believe that we can accelerate and expand the adoption of our distributed power generation solutions through: 


• | further reductions in the total cost of ownership;
--+---------------------------------------------------

​

• | increasing understanding of total avoided emissions and continued education regarding the multiple value streams that our solutions provide;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | increasing brand recognition and understanding of our differentiated platform portfolio;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | geographic and segment expansion;
--+----------------------------------

​

• | working to increase demand for on-site generation and microgrid expansion; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | product expansion across carbon separation and utilization, carbon capture and distributed hydrogen.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Levelized Cost of Energy
Our fuel cell projects deliver power at a rate comparable to pricing from the grid in our targeted markets. Policy programs that help to support adoption of clean distributed power generation often lead to below-grid pricing. We measure power costs by calculating the Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”) over the life of the project. 

21




There are several primary elements to LCOE for our fuel cell projects, including:

• | Capital cost;
--+--------------


• | Operations and maintenance cost; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | Fuel expense.
--+--------------

Given the level of integration in our business model of manufacturing, installing and operating fuel cell power platforms, there are multiple areas and opportunities for cost reductions. We are actively managing and reducing costs in all three LCOE areas, including cost reduction initiatives with respect to system components and raw materials, advanced lean manufacturing principles, improvements in lifetime product costs through continued system and platform engineering, and improvements in output and efficiency. We are also investing in platform design to reduce overall EPC cost associated with the installation of our platforms.
​
​
​
Manufacturing and Service Facilities
We operate a 167,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Torrington, Connecticut where we produce the individual cell packages and assemble the fuel cell modules. This facility also houses our global service center. Our completed modules are conditioned in Torrington and shipped directly to customer sites. We continue to make investments in various manufacturing areas to improve production throughput and annualized production rate. Currently, we are operating at a 45 MW per year annualized production rate on a single production shift. Maximum annualized capacity (module manufacturing, final assembly, testing and conditioning) is 100 MW per year under the Torrington facility’s current configuration when being fully utilized. The Torrington facility is sized to accommodate the eventual annualized production capacity of up to 200 MW per year with additional capital investment in machinery, equipment, tooling and inventory.
We design and manufacture the core SureSource fuel cell components that are stacked on top of each other to build a fuel cell stack. For megawatt-scale power plants, four fuel cell stacks are combined to build a 1.4 MW fuel cell module. To complete the power platform, the fuel cell module or modules are combined with the balance of plant (“BOP”). The mechanical BOP processes the incoming fuel such as natural gas or biogas and includes various fuel handling and processing equipment such as pipes and blowers. The electrical BOP processes the power generated for use by the customer and includes electrical interface equipment such as an inverter. The BOP components are either purchased directly from suppliers or the manufacturing is outsourced based on our designs and specifications. This strategy allows us to leverage our manufacturing capacity, focusing on the critical aspects of the power plant where we have specialized knowledge and expertise and possess extensive intellectual property. BOP components are shipped directly to a project site and are then assembled with the fuel cell module into a complete power plant.

The Torrington production and service facility and the Danbury corporate headquarters and research and development facility are ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified and our Field Service operation (which maintains the installed fleet of our platforms) is ISO 9001:2015 certified, reinforcing the tenets of our quality management system and our core values of safety, continuous improvement, and commitment to quality, environmental stewardship, and customer satisfaction. Sustainability is promoted throughout our organization. We manufacture SureSource products and manage them through end-of-life using environmentally friendly business processes and practices, certified to ISO 14001:2015. We continually strive to improve how we plan and execute across the entire product life cycle. We maintain a chain of custody and responsibility of our SureSource products throughout the product life cycle and strive for “cradle-to-cradle” sustainable business practices, incorporating sustainability in our corporate culture. We utilize “Design for Environment” principles in the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our power platforms. Design for Environment principles aim to reduce the overall human health and environmental impact of a product, process or service, when such impacts are considered across the product’s lifecycle. When our platforms reach the end of their useful lives, we can refurbish and re-use certain parts and then recycle most of what we cannot re-use. By weight, approximately 93% of the entire power plant can be re-used or recycled at the end of its useful life.
We have a manufacturing and service facility in Taufkirchen, Germany that has the capability to perform final module assembly for up to 20 MW per year of sub-megawatt fuel cell power platforms to service the European market. Our European service activities are also operated out of this location. Our operations in Europe are certified under both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015.
​
We have a research and development, and small scale manufacturing facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada that is focused on the engineering and development of our solid oxide fuel cell (“SOFC”) and solid oxide electrolysis cell (“SOEC”) stack technology. This facility includes equipment for the manufacturing of solid oxide cells and stacks, including an advanced automated stack manufacturing line which has been developed to ensure that the labor and overhead which are 

22




required to produce these technologies are optimized for efficiency and complement the low direct material cost of the stack. We intend to make additional investment in the Calgary facility to expand our SOFC and SOEC manufacturing capacity.
​
​
​
Raw Material Sourcing and Supplier Relationships
We use various commercially available raw materials and components to construct a fuel cell module, including nickel and stainless steel, which are key inputs in our manufacturing process. Our fuel cell stack raw materials are sourced from multiple vendors and are not considered precious metals. We have a global integrated supply chain with qualified sources of supply, many of which are located locally in the regions in which we have established manufacturing and service operations including Europe and Asia. 
Despite a somewhat volatile nickel market and increased pricing pressure on stainless steel direct materials, we have employed strategic inventory purchases and negotiated fixed-price supply contracts which have helped mitigate the impact to our product cost. Primarily driven by the consequential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also seeing extended shipping lead-times and pricing pressure on transportation and logistics. We have implemented several initiatives to mitigate the effect of these impacts by optimizing domestic supplier shipping volumes, leveraging competition across multiple qualified freight forwarders, establishing selective direct relationships with steamship lines, and aggregating shipments with qualified suppliers.
While we manufacture the fuel cells in our Torrington facility, the electrical and mechanical BOPs are assembled by and procured from several suppliers. All of our suppliers must undergo a stringent and rigorous qualification process. We continually evaluate and qualify new suppliers as we diversify our supplier base in our pursuit of lower costs, security of supply, and consistent quality. We purchase mechanical and electrical BOP components from third party vendors, based on our own proprietary designs.
Assuring the absence of conflict minerals in our power platforms is a continuing initiative. Our fuel cells, including the fuel cell components and completed fuel cell module, do not utilize any 3TG minerals (i.e., tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) that are classified as conflict minerals. We utilize componentry in the BOP such as computer circuit boards that utilize trace amounts of 3TG minerals. For perspective, total shipments in fiscal year 2020 weighed approximately 1.3 million pounds, of which only 6.0 pounds, or 0.000480%, represented 3TG minerals, so the presence of these minerals is negligible. Our conflict mineral disclosure filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Form SD contains specific information on the actions we are taking to avoid the use of conflict minerals.
​
Overall, as we continue to grow our business, we remain focused on improving quality, increasing the competitive supply landscape, maintaining existing supplier relationships, as well as building strong new key supplier relationships to expand our supply chain options.
​
Engineering, Procurement and Construction
We provide customers with complete turn-key solutions, including development, engineering, procurement, construction, interconnection and operations for our fuel cell projects. From an EPC standpoint, we have an extensive history of safe and timely delivery of turn-key projects. We have developed relationships with many design firms and licensed general contractors and have a repeatable, safe, and efficient execution philosophy that has been successfully demonstrated in numerous jurisdictions, both domestically and abroad, all with an exemplary safety record. The ability to rapidly and safely execute installations minimizes high-cost construction period financing and can assist customers in certain situations when the Commercial Operations Date is time sensitive.

Services and Warranty Agreements
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services, including engineering, project management and installation, and long-term operating and maintenance programs, including trained technicians that remotely monitor and operate our platforms around the world, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. We directly employ field technicians to service the power platforms and maintain service centers near our customers to support the high Availability of our platforms. 
For all operating fuel cell platforms not under a PPA, customers purchase long-term service agreements (“LTSAs”), some of which have terms of up to 20 years. Pricing for LTSAs is based upon the value of service assurance and the markets in which we compete and includes all future maintenance and fuel cell module exchanges. Each model of our SureSource power platform has a design life of 25-to-30 years. The fuel cell modules, with legacy modules having a 5-year cell design life and current production modules having a 7-year cell design life, go through periodic replacement, while the BOP systems, which consist of conventional mechanical and electrical equipment, are maintained over the life of the project.

23




Under the typical provisions of both our LTSAs and PPAs, we provide services to monitor, operate and maintain power platforms to meet specified performance levels. Operations and maintenance is a key driver for power platforms to deliver their projected revenue and cash flows. The service aspects of our business model provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for the Company. We have committed future production for scheduled fuel cell module exchanges under LTSAs and PPAs through the year which have expiration dates through 2042. The pricing structure of the LTSAs incorporates these scheduled fuel cell module exchanges and the committed nature of this production facilitates our production planning. Many of our PPAs and LTSAs include guarantees for system performance, including electrical output and heat rate. Should the power platform not meet the minimum performance levels, we may be required to replace the fuel cell module with a new or used replacement module and/or pay performance penalties. Our goal is to optimize the power platforms to meet expected operating parameters throughout their contracted service terms.
In addition to our service agreements, we provide a warranty for our products against manufacturing or performance defects for a specific period of time. The warranty term in the U.S. is typically 15 months after shipment or 12 months after acceptance of our products. We accrue for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience.

​
Competition
​
The market for clean energy is highly competitive. Many factors, including government incentives and specific market dynamics, affect how clean energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region. While clean energy often competes against the electric grid, which is readily available to prospective customers and supplied by traditional centralized power plants, including coal, gas, hydro, and nuclear plants, clean energy is increasingly able to compete with the grid and long-distance transmission of electricity in terms of levelized cost of electricity. Clean energy sources that customers may consider beyond our solutions include products such as wind turbines, solar arrays, and hydro facilities, as well as a range of hydrogen and fuel cell solutions from both incumbent and developing competitors.
​
Our platforms are based on a range of technologies and target a variety of applications, each of which have incumbent and developing competitors. Several companies in the U.S. are engaged in fuel cell development, although, to our knowledge, we are the only domestic company engaged in manufacturing and deployment of stationary natural gas or biogas fueled carbonate fuel cells. In addition to different types of stationary fuel cells, some other technologies that compete in the distributed generation marketplace include micro-turbines, turbines, and reciprocating gas engines.
​
Our stationary fuel cell platforms also compete against large scale solar and wind technologies, although we complement the unreliable intermittent nature of solar and wind power with the continuous, reliable power output of our fuel cells. Utility scale solar and wind power require specific geographies and weather profiles, require transmission for utility-scale applications, and require a source of back up capacity for when the sun or wind is not available. They also require a significant amount of land compared to our fuel cell power plants, making it difficult to site megawatt-class solar and wind projects in urban areas, unlike our solutions. While fuel cells emit negligible amounts of NOx, SOx and particulate matter, fuel cells do emit some carbon dioxide when fueled with natural gas or carbon-neutral biogas, but less per kWh compared to other less-efficient systems. In many markets, baseload fuel cells avoid more emissions than wind or solar systems of similar capacity because they operate for many more hours of the day compared to these intermittent resources.
​
Product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and development investments are crucial in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of such, as new technologies and solutions could make our solutions less competitive. 
​
We continue to invest in exploring new ways of further improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our platforms. Our objective is to continue to improve our competitive position, including innovating in areas like hydrogen and solid oxide, in order to add value for customers looking for clean and renewable energy and to aid in their decarbonization goals.

Backlog
Backlog represents definitive agreements executed by the Company and our customers. Project awards are not included in our backlog.
Backlog as of October 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands):
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
----------------------------+---+------+-----------+------+---+----------

Total Backlog | ​ | $ | 1,287,869 | ​ | $ | 1,285,373

​
Service and generation backlog as of October 31, 2021, had a weighted average term of approximately 17 years, with weighting based on dollar backlog and utility service contracts of up to 20 years in duration at inception. Generally, our government funded and privately funded research and development contracts are subject to the risk of termination at the convenience of the contract counterparty. 
​
Generation backlog is the largest component of our total commercial backlog, reflecting revenues from projects with PPAs in place and of which we have retained ownership. Under a PPA, the utility or end-user of the power (and other attributes such as capacity and renewable energy credits) commits to purchase power as it is produced for an extended period of time, typically 10-to-20 years. With the project being retained, electricity, capacity and/or renewable energy credits are recognized monthly over the term of the PPA. We report the financial performance of retained project assets as generation revenue and cost of generation revenues.
Our backlog amount outstanding is not indicative of amounts to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year. The specific elements of backlog may vary in terms of timing and revenue recognition from less than one year to up to 20 years. 
​
We may choose to sell or retain operating project assets on the balance sheet, thus creating variability in timing of revenue recognition. Accordingly, the timing and the nature of our business makes it difficult to predict what portion of our backlog will be filled in the next fiscal year.
License Agreements and Royalty Income; Relationship with POSCO Energy
License Agreement with EMRE
EMRE and FuelCell Energy began working together in 2016 under an initial joint development agreement with a focus on better understanding the fundamental science behind carbonate fuel cells for use in advanced applications and specifically how to increase efficiency in separating and concentrating carbon dioxide from the exhaust of natural gas-fueled power generation.
In June 2019, we entered into a license agreement with EMRE to facilitate the further development of our SureSource CaptureTM product (the “EMRE License Agreement”). Pursuant to the EMRE License Agreement, the Company granted EMRE and its affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, perpetual, irrevocable, non-transferable license and right to use our patents, data, know-how, improvements, equipment designs, methods, processes and the like to the extent it is useful to research, develop and commercially exploit carbonate fuel cells in applications in which the fuel cells concentrate carbon dioxide from industrial and power sources and for any other purpose attendant thereto or associated therewith, in 

25




exchange for a $10 million payment. Such right and license is sublicenseable to third parties performing work for or with EMRE or its affiliates but shall not otherwise be sublicenseable. 
The EMRE License Agreement facilitated the execution of the EMRE Joint Development Agreement, pursuant to which we have engaged in exclusive research and development efforts with EMRE to evaluate and develop new and/or improved carbonate fuel cells to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and power sources, in exchange for (a) payment of (i) an exclusivity and technology access fee of $5.0 million, (ii) up to $45.0 million for research and development efforts, and (iii) milestone-based payments of up to $10.0 million to be paid only if certain technological milestones are met (which had not been met as of October 31, 2021), and (b) certain licenses. 
Effective as of October 31, 2021, the Company and EMRE agreed, among other things, to extend the term of the EMRE Joint Development Agreement for an additional six months, ending on April 30, 2022 (unless terminated earlier). This extension allows for the continuation of research that would enable incorporation of design improvements to our current fuel cell design in order to support a decision to use the improvements in a future demonstration of the technology for capturing carbon at ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands and provides additional time to achieve the first milestone under the EMRE Joint Development Agreement.

License Agreements and Disputes with POSCO Energy; Settlement Agreement
From approximately 2007 through 2015, we relied on POSCO Energy to develop and grow the South Korean and Asian markets for our products and services. 
Through June of 2020, we recorded license fees and were entitled to receive royalty income from POSCO Energy pursuant to manufacturing and technology transfer agreements entered into with POSCO Energy, including the Alliance Agreement dated February 7, 2007 (and amendments thereto), the Technology Transfer, License and Distribution Agreement dated February 7, 2007 (and amendments thereto), the Stack Technology Transfer and License Agreement dated October 27, 2009 (and amendments thereto), and the Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement dated October 31, 2012 (and amendments thereto) (collectively, the “License Agreements”). The Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement (“CTTA”) provided POSCO Energy with the exclusive technology rights to manufacture, sell, distribute and service our SureSource 300, SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000 fuel cell technology in the South Korean and broader Asian markets. POSCO Energy built a cell manufacturing facility in Pohang, South Korea which became operational in late 2015, but is no longer operating.
In October 2016, the Company and POSCO Energy extended the terms of certain of the License Agreements to be consistent with the term of the CTTA, which was to expire on October 31, 2027. The CTTA required POSCO Energy to pay us a 3.0% royalty on POSCO Energy net product sales, as well as a royalty on scheduled fuel cell module replacements under service agreements for modules that were built by POSCO Energy and installed at plants in Asia under the terms of long-term service agreements (“LTSAs”) between POSCO Energy and its customers. Due to certain actions and inactions of POSCO Energy, we have not realized any new material revenues, royalties or new projects developed by POSCO Energy since late 2015. 
In March 2017, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with POSCO Energy to permit us to directly develop the Asian fuel cell business, including the right for us to sell SureSource solutions in South Korea and the broader Asian market. In June 2018, POSCO Energy advised us in writing that it was terminating the MOU effective July 15, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, notwithstanding its termination, we continued to execute on sales commitments in Asia secured in writing prior to July 15, 2018, including the 20 MW power plant installed for KOSPO. 
In November 2019, POSCO Energy spun-off its fuel cell business into a new entity, Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (“KFC”), without our consent. As part of the spin-off, POSCO Energy transferred manufacturing and service rights under the License Agreements to KFC, but retained distribution rights and severed its own liability under the License Agreements. We formally objected to POSCO Energy’s spin-off, and POSCO Energy posted a bond to secure any liabilities to us arising out of the spin-off. In September 2020, the Korean Electricity Regulatory Committee found that POSCO Energy’s spin-off of the fuel cell business to KFC may have been done in violation of South Korean law.
On February 19, 2020, we notified POSCO Energy in writing that it was in material breach of the License Agreements by (i) its actions in connection with the spin-off of the fuel cell business to KFC, (ii) its suspension of performance through its cessation of all sales activities since late 2015 and its abandonment of its fuel cell business in Asia, and (iii) its disclosure of material nonpublic information to third parties and its public pronouncements about the fuel cell business on television and in print media that have caused reputational damage to the fuel cell business, our Company and our products. We also notified POSCO Energy that, under the terms of the License Agreements, it had 60 days to fully cure its breaches to our satisfaction and that failure to so cure would lead to termination of the License Agreements. Further, on March 27, 2020, 

26




we notified POSCO Energy of additional instances of its material breach of the License Agreements based on POSCO Energy’s failure to pay royalties required to be paid in connection with certain module exchanges.
On April 27, 2020, POSCO Energy initiated a series of three arbitration demands against us at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce seated in Singapore, in which it alleged certain warranty defects in a sub-megawatt conditioning facility at its facility in Pohang, South Korea and sought combined damages of approximately $3.3 million. Prior to filing the arbitrations, POSCO Energy obtained provisional attachments from the Seoul Central District Court attaching certain revenues owed to us by KOSPO as part of such warranty claims, which delayed receipt of certain payments owed to us. POSCO Energy subsequently sought additional provisional attachments on KOSPO revenues from the Seoul Central District Court based on unspecified warranty claims in an additional amount of approximately $7 million, and additional provisional attachments on KOSPO revenues from the Seoul Central District Court based on its alleged counterclaims in the license termination arbitration described below in an additional amount of approximately $110 million. As of October 31, 2021, outstanding accounts receivable due from KOSPO were $11.2 million. POSCO Energy posted a bond in the amount of $46 million to secure any damages to us resulting from the attachments.
​
On June 28, 2020, we terminated the License Agreements and filed a demand for arbitration against POSCO Energy and KFC in the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce based on POSCO Energy’s (i) failure to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to sell our technology in the South Korean and Asian markets, (ii) disclosure of our proprietary information to third parties, (iii) attack on our stock price, and (iv) spin-off of POSCO Energy’s fuel cell business into KFC without our consent. We requested that the arbitral tribunal (a) confirm through declaration that POSCO Energy’s exclusive license to market our technology and products in South Korea and Asia is null and void as a result of the breaches of the License Agreements and that we had the right to pursue direct sales in these markets, (b) order POSCO Energy and KFC to compensate us for losses and damages suffered in the amount of more than $200 million, and (c) order POSCO Energy and KFC to pay our arbitration costs, including counsel fees and expenses. We retained outside counsel on a contingency basis to pursue our claims, and outside counsel entered into an agreement with a litigation finance provider to fund the legal fees and expenses of the arbitration. In October 2020, POSCO Energy filed a counterclaim in the arbitration (x) seeking approximately $880 million in damages based on allegations that we misrepresented the capabilities of our fuel cell technology to induce POSCO Energy to enter into the License Agreements and failed to turn over know-how sufficient for POSCO Energy to successfully operate its business; (y) seeking a declaration that the License Agreements remained in full force and effect and requesting the arbitral tribunal enjoin us from interfering in POSCO Energy’s exclusive rights under the License Agreements and (z) seeking an order that we pay POSCO Energy’s arbitration costs, including counsel fees and expenses.
We discontinued revenue recognition of the deferred license revenue related to the License Agreements in July 2020 given the then-pending arbitrations.
On August 28, 2020, POSCO Energy filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court”) purportedly seeking to enforce its rights as a stockholder of the Company to inspect and make copies and extracts of certain books and records of the Company and/or the Company’s subsidiaries pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and/or Delaware common law. POSCO Energy alleged that it was seeking to inspect these documents for a proper purpose reasonably related to its interests as a stockholder of the Company, including investigating whether our Board of Directors and management breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty, due care, and good faith. POSCO Energy sought an order of the Court permitting POSCO Energy to inspect and copy the demanded books and records, awarding POSCO Energy reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the matter, and granting such other and further relief as the Court deemed just and proper. On July 9, 2021, the Court issued a post-trial ruling denying POSCO Energy’s demand to inspect the Company’s books and records because POSCO Energy lacked a proper purpose. The Court held that the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that this complaint was the seventh legal action POSCO Energy initiated against us within the span of nine months, confirmed that POSCO Energy’s purpose in initiating the books and records demand and filing the complaint was not proper. As this dispute was resolved by the Court as described above, it did not require resolution pursuant to, and was not part of, the Settlement Agreement described below.
On September 14, 2020, POSCO Energy filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “SD Court”) alleging that we delayed the removal of restrictive legends on certain share certificates held by POSCO Energy in 2018, thus precluding POSCO Energy from selling the shares and resulting in claimed losses in excess of $1,000,000. On September 16, 2021, the SD Court ruled in our favor on a motion for summary judgement dismissing all four counts of POSCO Energy’s complaint regarding share certificates held by POSCO Energy in 2018, but granted POSCO Energy leave to file an amended complaint. 
​

27




In order to resolve the disputes described above (other than the books and records dispute which was resolved by the Court), on December 20, 2021, we entered into the Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy and KFC (POSCO Energy and KFC may be collectively referred to herein as “PE Group”). The Settlement Agreement provides, among other things, that the parties will cooperate in good faith to effect a market transition to us of the molten carbonate fuel cell business in Korea in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement. To that end, the Settlement Agreement provides that any and all past, current, or potential disputes and claims between us, on the one hand, and POSCO Energy and KFC, on the other, of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, asserted or not asserted, based on actions or omissions of any party on or before the date of Settlement Agreement are fully and finally settled, including such disputes and claims, directly or indirectly, in connection with the legal disputes (other than the books and records dispute which was resolved by the Court) and License Agreements described above, with the exception of (i) an unfiled claim by us in the amount of approximately $1.8 million with respect to certain royalties we believe are owed by POSCO Energy with respect to replacement modules deployed by POSCO Energy at Gyenonggi Green Energy and other sites for which POSCO Energy has not paid royalties, and (ii) an unfiled claim by POSCO Energy in an unknown amount with respect to a series of purchase orders for materials and components which began in 2014 under a supply chain contract, both of which claims remain unsettled. We do not believe the claim by POSCO Energy with respect to purchase orders for materials and components under the supply chain contract has merit and we retain the right to file a counterclaim for damages we believe we have incurred with respect to such supply chain contract. With respect to the attachments described above, the Settlement Agreement provides that, within five days of the date of the Settlement Agreement, POSCO Energy will file an application with the Seoul Central District Court to revoke the attachments. Thereafter, we expect to promptly receive the outstanding KOSPO accounts receivable of approximately $11.2 million held by the Seoul Central District Court.
​
Under the Settlement Agreement, the parties have also agreed that, within five days of the date thereof, we will withdraw our objection to the spin-off of KFC from POSCO Energy, and that the License Agreements are not terminated, but instead are deemed to be amended such that POSCO Energy and KFC only have the right (i) to provide maintenance and repair services to PE Group’s existing customers on existing molten carbonate power generation and thermal projects under LTSAs currently in force as well as LTSAs that have expired and are pending renewal as of the settlement date (collectively, “Existing LTSAs”), (ii) to supply replacement modules purchased from us only for their existing customers for existing molten carbonate power generation and thermal projects under Existing LTSAs and (iii) to own, operate and maintain all facilities and factories solely for the purposes set forth in (i) and (ii) above (collectively, the “Right to Service License”). POSCO Energy and KFC further agree that, as of the date of the Settlement Agreement, the License Agreements are deemed to be amended such that we exclusively enjoy all rights as to our technology in Korea and Asia, other than the Right to Service License. The Settlement Agreement further provides that the License Agreements will terminate automatically upon sixty days prior written notice to PE Group if (i) we enter into a business collaboration agreement with a Korean company to construct, assemble, manufacture, market, sell, distribute, import, export, install, commission, service, maintain, or repair products incorporating our technology, or otherwise conduct our business, in the Korean market; or (ii) we expand the capacity of our existing Korean entity such as to perform such activities itself. In the event of the termination of the License Agreements, the license granted to PE Group under the Right to Service License will continue notwithstanding the termination of the License Agreements, except that PE Group’s right to own, operate, and maintain all facilities and factories for the purpose of servicing any orders or requests made by us will terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, PE Group has no right to manufacture modules or any other product incorporating our technology under the License Agreements as amended, the Right to Service License or otherwise unless requested and authorized by us to do so.

The Settlement Agreement further provides that, in order to service its existing customers under the Existing LTSAs, KFC will place a firm, non-cancelable order for twelve SureSource 3000 modules within two weeks after the date of the Settlement Agreement and an additional firm, non-cancelable order for eight SureSource 3000 modules on or before June 30, 2022, all at a price of $3.0 million per module. In addition, KFC agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to order fourteen additional SureSource 3000 modules by December 31, 2022, at a price of $3.0 million per module if ordered by such date. If KFC materially breaches the Settlement Agreement by failing to make timely and full payment for the modules for which KFC is required to place orders under the Settlement Agreement and does not cure such material breach within fifteen days of notice of such breach by us, the License Agreements and the Right to Service License granted to PE Group will be terminated. If we materially breach the Settlement Agreement by failing to supply the modules for which KFC is required to place orders under the Settlement Agreement, as long as KFC has made the payment for such modules and has otherwise satisfied its contractual obligations for those modules and such material breach is not cured within sixty days after notice from PE Group, PE Group will have the right to terminate the Settlement Agreement. With respect to any other alleged breach, material or otherwise, of the Settlement Agreement, the parties’ exclusive remedy consists solely of general damages.

28





Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, with respect to new modules to be supplied by us and deployed by PE Group to its existing customers, we will provide our standard warranty against module defects until the earlier of eighteen months from the date of shipment or twelve months from the date of installation. As part of the global settlement of the disputes among the parties and subject to the qualifications set forth in the Settlement Agreement, we will reimburse PE Group for any annual output penalty amount paid by PE Group to its customers pursuant to Existing LTSAs (whether such Existing LTSA is extended or renewed), caused by a shortfall or defect in the new modules for a period of up to seven years. The maximum annual reimbursement obligation with regard to any PE Group customer for any new module provided by us will not exceed an amount equal to 7.5% per year of the module purchase price. We will not be required to reimburse PE Group for any penalty paid by PE Group under the Existing LTSAs that is not caused by a shortfall or defect in the modules to be supplied by us including, without limitation, any shortfall or defect caused by a site-related problem, a problem with the balance of plant, or other components of the project.
​
Although we have the exclusive and unrestricted right under the Settlement Agreement to perform, pursue, and otherwise conduct our business in relation to new fuel cell projects (including new projects with PE Group’s existing customers) in Korea and Asia, the parties have agreed that, except as further provided in the Settlement Agreement with respect to PE Group’s existing customers Noeul Green Energy and Godeok Green Energy, we will not engage in discussions with PE Group’s existing customers regarding Existing LTSAs without PE Group’s consent. The parties have further agreed that if PE Group cannot enter into an agreement with its existing customers to extend or renew Existing LTSAs by December 31, 2022, PE Group will cooperate with us so that we may discuss and, at our sole discretion, enter into an extension of an Existing LTSA, a new LTSA to replace an Existing LTSA, or a module sales agreement with PE Group’s existing customers; provided that (i) should we enter into such an arrangement with a PE Group existing customer, and (ii) we are required to provide replacement modules to such existing customer under such arrangement, and (iii) PE Group has not already deployed all or some the modules that PE Group ordered under Settlement Agreement, we will purchase the number of required replacement modules from PE Group at a price of $3.0 million per module (to the extent such modules are available and have not yet been deployed). The purchase of such replacement modules by us is contingent upon the modules being in proper condition as determined by inspection process to be agreed by the parties. Any modules purchased by us from PE Group under these terms will be included as part of the firm orders KFC is required to make pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.

With respect to operations and maintenance agreements, the Settlement Agreement provides that KFC will have the right of first refusal on providing operation and maintenance services on commercially reasonable terms for new LTSAs entered into by us in Korea for a period of the first to occur of either twenty-four months after the date of the Settlement Agreement or until such time as we engage a third party capable of providing such services in Korea. If we and KFC agree that KFC should provide operation and maintenance services pursuant to the right of first refusal, we and KFC will enter into one or more operation and maintenance agreements that reflect commercially reasonable terms and conditions as agreed by us and KFC at that time.

With respect to BOP, KFC currently has eight units of BOP available, and the Settlement Agreement provides that we have the option to purchase such units of BOP for any new molten carbonate fuel cell projects within Korea at a price of KRW 2,550,000,000 per unit. We will also have a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable license to use the intellectual property imbedded in the BOP units in Korea in consideration for a reasonable license fee to be separately agreed by the parties. Detailed terms and conditions of BOP and related software and firmware supply will be discussed and agreed in good faith in separate BOP supply agreements in the event we exercise our option to purchase any of such BOP.

As noted above, we retained outside counsel on a contingency basis to pursue our claims against POSCO Energy and KFC, and outside counsel entered into an agreement with a litigation finance provider to fund the legal fees and expenses of the arbitration proceedings brought by us against POSCO Energy and KFC. As we have entered into the Settlement Agreement, we are required to remit fees to our counsel, Wiley Rein, LLP (“Wiley”), subject to the terms of our engagement letter with Wiley. On December 23, 2021, we agreed that we will pay Wiley a total of $24.0 million to satisfy all obligations to Wiley under our engagement letter, of which $14.0 million will be paid on or before December 30, 2021, $5.0 million will be paid on or before March 30, 2022, and $5.0 million will be paid on or before June 30, 2022.

Regulatory and Legislative Environment
Distributed generation addresses certain power generation issues that central generation does not and legal, legislative and regulatory policy can impact deployment of distributed generation. The policies that affect our products are not always the same as those imposed on our competitors, and while some policies can make our products less competitive, others may provide an advantage. Certain utility policies may also pose barriers to our installation or interconnection with the utility grid, such as backup, standby or departing load charges that make installation of our products less economically attractive for our customers. Regulatory and legislative support can take the form of policy, incentive programs, and defined sustainability initiatives such as Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”).
Various states and municipalities in the U.S. have adopted programs for which our products qualify, including programs supporting self-generation, clean air power generation, combined heat and power applications, carbon reduction, grid resiliency/microgrids and utility ownership of fuel cell projects.
​
Many states in the U.S. have enacted legislation adopting Clean Energy Standards (“CES”) or RPS mechanisms. Under these standards, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible resources according to a set schedule. CES and RPS, and their implementing regulations, vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s mandate, the definition of eligible clean and renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for CES or RPS compliance. Fuel cells using biogas qualify as renewable power generation technology in all of the CES and RPS states in the U.S., and some states specify that fuel cells operating on natural gas are also eligible for these initiatives in recognition of the high efficiency and low pollutants of fuel cells. Most states are introducing legislation or regulations that seek to reduce the consumption of electricity generated using fossil fuels in favor of zero carbon resources. Additionally, utility regulators are looking for non-wire alternatives to build reliability and resiliency to the grid, which also presents a potential opportunity.
​
In February 2018, the U.S. Congress reinstated the 30% Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for fuel cells and extended and significantly expanded the existing Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit. The ITC phased down to 26% in 2020 and was scheduled to phase down to 22% by 2022 and expire in 2023. The reinstatement of the ITC for fuel cells provided equal access to tax incentives for U.S. fuel cell manufacturers when compared to other clean energy solutions. The ITC phase down was extended by two years pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 passed by Congress in December 2020 and signed by the President on December 27, 2020, thus extending the 26% ITC until 2022 and the expiration to 2025. 
Internationally, South Korea has an RPS to promote clean energy, reduce carbon emissions, and develop local manufacturing of clean energy generation products to accelerate economic growth. The RPS is designed to increase new and renewable power generation to 10% of total power generation by 2023 from 2% when the RPS began in 2012. Twenty-two of the largest power generators are obligated to achieve the RPS requirements in their generation or purchase offsetting renewable energy certificates. Financial penalties are levied by the government for non-compliance. European governments are supportive of hydrogen-based generation and efficient CHP applications. Italy adopted a system to promote energy efficiency with Italian “White Certificates” (Energy Efficiency Certificates) that are tradable certificates, for which fuel cells qualify, to promote energy savings expressed in tons of oil equivalent saved. Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands provide tax incentives, grants and waivers of regulatory fees for clean energy installations. Additionally, large energy-intensive industry sectors and the aviation sector in European Union countries above a certain size qualify for the ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) and are subject to a cap-and-trade requirement for carbon emissions.

Government Regulation
Our Company and our products are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Emissions of SOx and NOx from our power plants are substantially lower than conventional combustion-based generating stations and are far below existing and proposed regulatory limits. The primary emissions from our power plants, assuming no cogeneration application, are humid flue gas that is discharged at temperatures of 700-800° F, water that is discharged at temperatures of 10-20° F above ambient air temperatures, and CO2 in per-kW hour amounts that are, due to the high efficiency of fuel cells, significantly less than conventional fossil fuel central generation power plants. Depending on the jurisdiction, whether our plants require water discharge permits is dependent upon whether the discharge is directed to a storm drain or wastewater system.
We are also subject to federal, state, provincial and/or local regulation with respect to, among other things, siting. Furthermore, utility companies and several states in the U.S. have created and adopted, or are in the process of creating and adopting, interconnection regulations covering both technical and financial requirements for the interconnection of fuel cell power plants to utility grids. Our power plants are designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in the international markets in which we operate. Our SureSource solutions are CARB 2007 certified, and our SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000, when operating on biogas, are certified for the CARB 2013 Biogas standard. 
​
Proprietary Rights and Licensed Technology
Our intellectual property consists of patents, trade secrets, institutional knowledge and know-how that we believe is a competitive advantage and represents a barrier to entry for potential competitors. We have extensive experience in designing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining fuel cell power plants. This experience cannot be easily or quickly replicated and, combined with our trade secrets, proprietary processes and patents, safeguards our intellectual property rights.
​
As of October 31, 2021, we (excluding our subsidiaries) had 113 U.S. patents and 222 patents in other jurisdictions covering our fuel cell technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with patents directed to various aspects of our SureSource technology, SOFC technology, PEM fuel cell technology and applications thereof. As of October 31, 2021, we also had 45 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 92 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. 
​
As of October 31, 2021, our subsidiary, Versa Power Systems, Ltd. (“Versa”), had 30 U.S. patents and 85 international patents covering SOFC technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions). As of October 31, 2021, Versa also had 5 pending U.S. patent applications and 16 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. In addition, as of October 31, 2021, our subsidiary, FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, had license rights to 2 U.S. patents and 7 patents outside the U.S. (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions) for carbonate fuel cell technology licensed from Fraunhofer IKTS.
We continue to innovate, and no patent expiration, either individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have any material impact on our current or anticipated operations.
​
Certain of our U.S. patents are the result of government-funded research and development programs, including our DOE programs. U.S. patents we own that resulted from government-funded research are subject to the government potentially exercising “march-in” rights. We believe that the likelihood of the U.S. government exercising these rights is remote and would only occur if we ceased our commercialization efforts and there was a compelling national need to use the patents.
​
Significant Customers and Information about Geographic Areas
We contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of our products and for research and development. For the years ended October 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our top customers, EMRE, Connecticut Light and Power, KOSPO, the DOE, UIL Holdings Corporation, Pfizer, Inc. and Dominion Bridgeport Fuel Cell, LLC, accounted for an aggregate of

​
We have marketing and manufacturing operations both within and outside the United States. We source raw materials and BOP components from a diverse global supply chain. In fiscal year 2021, the foreign country with the greatest concentration risk was South Korea, accounting for 12% of our consolidated net revenues. While we plan to aggressively pursue sales of our products in South Korea as a result of the Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy and KFC, we are also in the process of diversifying our sales mix from both a customer specific and geographic perspective as part of our overall strategic plan.
​
The international nature of our operations subjects us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements and tariffs, taxes, and other trade restrictions. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” – “We are subject to risks inherent in international operations.” See also Note 17. “Segment Information,” to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our net sales by geographic region for the years ended October 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
