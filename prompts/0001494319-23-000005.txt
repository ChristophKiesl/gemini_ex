ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
In 1924, George Van Waters and Nat Rogers opened a brokerage business in Seattle, Washington, buying and selling naval supplies, paint, raw materials and cotton linters. Nearly 100 years later, and after many different incarnations of the business, we closed our initial public offering in 2015. In 2019, we acquired Nexeo Solutions, Inc. (“Nexeo”), a leading global chemicals distributor. The acquisition expanded and strengthened our presence in North America and provided the opportunity to create the largest North American sales force in chemical and ingredients distribution.
Today we are a leading global distributor of commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as a provider of value-added services, to customers across a wide range of diverse industries. We purchase chemicals and ingredients from producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport and sell those materials safely to nearly 100,000 customer locations across approximately 120 countries. We provide application development and technical advice to customers formulating new products and have a network of Solution Centers to support customer development activities. We operate an extensive worldwide chemical and ingredient distribution network, including approximately 9,700 employees and approximately 600 facilities, serviced by the following: approximately 4,900 tractors, tankers and trailers; and approximately 2,500 railcars, 120 rail and barge terminals and 20 deep sea terminals, focused on timely and safe delivery to a spectrum of customers, large and small. Our purpose is to help keep our communities healthy, fed, clean and safe.
Chemical and ingredient producers rely on us to safely warehouse, repackage, transport, market and sell their products as a way to expand their market access, enhance their geographic reach and lower their cost to serve and grow their business. Customers who purchase products and services from us benefit from a lower total cost of ownership, as they are able to simplify their sourcing process by outsourcing functions to us, such as “just-in-time delivery,” product availability and selection, packaging, mixing and blending. They also rely on us for safe and secure delivery and the off-loading of chemicals, compliant with increasing local and federal regulations. Additionally, customers and suppliers depend on our deep end market knowledge and technical expertise to provide formulation and recipe development services to help meet the latest market trends and adhere to regulatory requirements across our global network of Solution Centers.
The effects of market conditions on our operations are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Recent Developments
In July 2022, we acquired Vicom Distribución Productos Quimicos, S.L. ("Vicom"), a leading regional specialty chemical distributor in Spain and Portugal.
In December 2021, we acquired Sweetmix Distribuidora de Materias Primas Industriais Ltda (“Sweetmix”), a food ingredients and coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (“CASE”) specialty chemical distribution company in Brazil.
In April 2021, we sold the Distrupol business within our EMEA segment.
In December 2020, we acquired the business of Zhuhai Techi Chem Silicone Industry Corporation (“Techi Chem”), a leading distributor of specialty silicone solutions used primarily for the CASE market within the China marketplace.
At the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2020, we decided to wind down our Canadian Agriculture wholesale distribution business, which was operationally completed by December 31, 2020.
In November 2020, we sold our Canadian Agriculture services business and in September 2020, we sold our industrial spill and emergency response businesses.

USA
We are the largest commodity and specialty chemical and ingredient distributor in the United States (“US”). Our locations span the US, with personnel strategically located where customers and suppliers need them and ready to provide agile, reliable support for their businesses. We serve as a marketing and sales arm for our suppliers, helping to bring their chemicals and ingredients to market in a manner that creates additional value for our customers' end products. We blend, mix and repackage bulk chemicals for shipment by our transportation fleet, as well as common carriers, and utilize our network of terminal and supply locations to optimize bulk shipment deliveries. In the US, we use centralized shared information technology systems, raw materials procurement, logistics, route operations and producer relationship management in an effort to benefit from economies of scale and improve cost efficiency. 
In addition to our broad commodity and specialties and services offerings, we distribute ingredients and provide specialized expertise. Leveraging our Solution Centers, we seek to provide value-added technical services such as formulation and recipe development, benchmark prototyping, product performance testing, chemical analysis, custom blending and other technical services. 
Our offerings service a majority of the Life Sciences (formerly Consumer Solutions) and Industrial sectors in the US and specific end markets, which are discussed further below. Our sales force is organized through a combination of geographic and end market factors. Our bulk and local chemical distribution customers are serviced primarily by regional teams and our ingredients and specialties customers are serviced primarily by our end market and product-technically focused teams.
We believe our close proximity to customers, installed asset base, transportation and digital assets, and our extensive product knowledge and end market expertise, all serve as competitive advantages and provide sustainable value to our suppliers and customers.
EMEA
We maintain a strong presence in the United Kingdom and continental Europe with sales offices in 18 countries. This segment also includes two sales offices in the Middle East and Africa. Within this segment and where possible globally, we leverage centralized or shared information technology systems, raw materials procurement, logistics, route operations and producer relationships management to benefit from economies of scale and improve cost efficiency. 
We support commodity and specialty chemical and ingredient distribution to customers primarily in our Industrial Solutions, Life Sciences and General Industrial end markets, with the heaviest focus in the CASE, food ingredients, beauty and personal care, pharmaceutical, and homecare and industrial cleaning submarkets. These strategies and customers are supported by Solution Centers throughout the EMEA region, with key centers of excellence locations in Paris, France and a state-of-the-art formulation laboratory opened in Essen, Germany in 2022. 
Our technical sales force supports customers at a country level through strong end market expertise and key account management capabilities. We believe our scale and focused regional, industry and product expertise provide competitive advantages and sustainable value to our suppliers and customers. 
Canada
We have distribution sites and Solution Centers located in all key geographies throughout Canada supporting commodity and specialty chemical and ingredient distribution across customers in our General Industrial, Industrial Solutions, Refining & Chemical Processing and Life Sciences end markets. 
Table of Contents

More specifically, in Eastern Canada, we have deep product knowledge in submarkets such as food ingredients, beauty and personal care, pharmaceutical ingredients & finished products, CASE, chemical manufacturing, homecare and industrial cleaning and mining. In Western Canada, our submarket expertise in forestry and energy (e.g., midstream gas pipeline, oil sands processing and oil refining) further complements our broad offerings within the country.
Our sales force is deployed through specialized account management across Canada to serve our focused customer end markets within ingredients and specialties, and through a geographic sales district model to support the bulk and local chemical distribution end markets. We leverage shared information systems and technology within Canada.
LATAM 
Our LATAM operations are regionally focused with distribution sites and Solution Centers located principally in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. We work to meet the needs of our customers through a team of chemical sales, product management and supply chain professionals. As previously noted, our presence in Brazil grew in December 2021 with the acquisition of Sweetmix.
Our offerings support commodity and specialty chemical and ingredient distribution customers primarily in our General Industrial, Industrial Solutions and Life Sciences end markets, with submarkets largely focused on CASE, beauty and personal care, chemical manufacturing and food ingredients. We also provide formulation services for crop protection manufacturers in Brazil.
Products and End Markets
We source and inventory commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients in large quantities such as barge loads, railcars or full truck loads directly from producers and break down the bulk quantities to repackage, market, sell and distribute smaller quantities to our customers.
In addition to selling and distributing commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, we use our transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous materials handling to provide important distribution and specialized services for our producers and our customers. We also have state-of-the-art Solution Centers at locations across the globe, consisting of formulation labs, development and research centers, and taste kitchens, with specialized industry expertise and innovative technical capabilities to help our customers address their technical challenges and accelerate product development cycles. At the heart of our business model are our technically trained professionals with deep industry experience.
Chemicals and Services
Chemicals and Services represent the largest portion of our business by sales, volume and gross profit (exclusive of depreciation). Our product portfolio principally includes a wide range of organic and inorganic chemistries, surfactants, inorganic compounds and general chemicals which are used extensively throughout most end markets. Investments in salesforce effectiveness systems are focused on a customer centric selling model, which coupled with our facility, transportation and digital asset bases, and our extensive supplier partnerships, all support growth within the chemicals distribution landscape. 
Ingredients and Specialties
Ingredients and Specialties represent a more value added, higher-growth portion of the market tailored to specific end market requirements. For each Ingredients and Specialties market, we have dedicated sales, marketing, product management and technical professionals with deep industry knowledge of individual submarkets like food ingredients or pharmaceuticals, serving approximately 500 strategic specialty chemical suppliers and approximately 42,000 customer locations. These specialty products are typically sold in lower volumes, but at a higher gross profit (exclusive of depreciation) than commodity products. We believe growth can be achieved by leveraging salesforce effectiveness, delivering solutions through industry expertise, technical capabilities, formulation support and our comprehensive supply chain infrastructure.

Suppliers
We source materials from approximately 1,800 producers around the globe and we typically maintain relationships with multiple producers in order to protect against disruption in supply and distribution logistics, as well as to ensure competitive pricing of our supply. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our ten largest producers accounted for approximately 41% of our total chemical purchases.
Distribution Channels
We have multiple channels to market, including both warehouse delivery and direct-to-consumer delivery. The principal determinants of the way a customer is serviced include the size, scale and level of customization of a particular order, the nature of the product and the customer, and the location of the product inventories. Our logistics and supply chain expertise allows us to service a wide range of customers by offering multiple package sizes and assistance with unique special handling requirements, safety and quality specifications.
Warehouse distribution
Our warehouse distribution infrastructure is the core of our operations and connects large producers with smaller volume customers whose consumption patterns tend to make them uneconomical to be served directly by producers. As a result, the core customer serviced via our warehouses is a small or medium-volume consumer of chemicals and ingredients. We purchase chemicals and ingredients in truck load or larger quantities from producers based on contracted demands of our customers and our estimates of anticipated customer purchases. Once received, products are stored in one or more of our distribution facilities for sale and distribution in smaller, less-than-truckload quantities to our customers. Our warehouses have various facilities for services such as repackaging, blending and mixing to create specialized solutions needed by our customers in ready-to-use formulations.
Direct distribution
In direct distribution, we sell and service large quantity purchases that are shipped directly from producers through our logistics infrastructure, which provides our customers with sourcing and logistics support services for inventory management and delivery.

Competition
The chemical and ingredient distribution and service markets are highly competitive. Most of the products that we distribute are made to standard specifications and are either produced by or available from multiple sources. Furthermore, chemical and ingredient distribution itself is a fragmented market in which only a small number of competitors have substantial international operations. Our principal international competitors are Brenntag SE, IMCD NV, Barentz International NV and Azelis Group NV, each of which have differentiating strengths across regions and not all of whom have the ability to serve all of the end markets in which we operate. Many other chemical and ingredient distributors focus on a more limited geographic region or smaller subset of products, building strong relationships with local producers and customers that may give them a competitive advantage in their local market. 
Chemical and ingredient producers may also sell their products through a direct sales force, digital marketplace or multiple chemical distributors, limiting their use of third party distributors, particularly with respect to higher margin products, or partnering with other chemical and ingredient producers for distribution, each of which could impact our competitive position.
We compete on the basis of service, on-time delivery, packaging type, product breadth and availability, product and market knowledge and insights, safety and environmental compliance, global reach, product price, as well as our ability to provide certain additional value-added services through our comprehensive suite of solution-based offerings.
Human Capital Resources
We recognize that our people represent our most important asset. As part of our effort to drive continued growth and increased profitability, we are intently focused on building a place that attracts and retains top talent and develops the skills necessary to drive differentiation for our business. The below data provides a snapshot of our employee and management demographics as of December 31, 2022:

Employees* | | | People Managers* | | 1,753
USA | 5,498 | | Male | | 66 | %

(*)Information based on self-identification data.
We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies that guide our human capital management approach as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies are advanced through a number of programs and initiatives as outlined below:
Employee Total Rewards and Wellbeing
Our total rewards programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with their performance and to provide appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. Full-time US employees are eligible for health, dental and vision insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a 401(k) plan and life and disability/accident insurance coverage. Employees outside of the US are eligible for a variety of supplemental benefits based on local market practices and all employees worldwide are eligible for an employee assistance program and other well-being programs. We periodically benchmark our total rewards offerings externally to ensure we remain competitive.
Training and Development
All employees have access to on-demand learning resources for their own professional development on a range of diverse topics such as digital transformation skills, professional effectiveness, diversity, equity and inclusion, business skills, productivity, collaboration tools and leadership development. Our internal program offerings range from multi-day, instructor-
Table of Contents

led trainings to short, on-demand eLearning programs. As appropriate, additional training hours are delivered and monitored locally, often focusing on material handling and safety for specific roles. The Company's guiding principles and cultural values are incorporated into our Code Handbook, to which all employees certify annually.
Employee Engagement
We regularly conduct confidential employee engagement surveys and focus groups. The feedback gathered from these surveys and focus groups helps guide our decision-making and strategic initiatives. In 2022, at least 85% of our global employee population participated in one or more of these feedback channels, sharing their sentiments on key aspects of working at the Company. The engagement survey results are shared in aggregate with managers, who are then tasked with taking action based on employee feedback. In doing so, our goal is to drive year-over-year improvement in employee engagement, which we believe will deliver qualitative and quantitative benefits for our Company.
Health and Safety
We are serious about safety, which is a key area of focus across our global operations. Specific initiatives include, among others, data driven and causality-based accident prevention work, improved process and facility controls, mandatory general education and role specific safety training, joint management-worker health and safety committees, safety audits, incident investigation and improvement measures. 2022 was our safest year on record with a Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), the rate of recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked, of 0.33, compared with 0.40 in 2021 and ahead of our 2025 target of 0.38.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
We are committed to fostering a safe, collaborative, supportive and respectful environment that values diverse perspectives, mitigates unconscious bias and enables a culture where employees are able to bring their authentic self to work. In the past year we maintained our score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, increased the favorability rating of our inclusive culture amongst our salaried employee population, increased the number of female people managers globally and increased the number of ethnically diverse people managers in the USA. We use our global inclusion councils to help hold ourselves accountable for progress and drive decision-making for the unique needs of our diverse employee groups. Additionally, we seek to drive greater employee engagement, create education opportunities, and instill a greater sense of community through the efforts of our eight Employee Resource Networks.
As a July 2020 signatory of CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion TM (CEO Action) coalition, we have pledged to take action designed to foster a safe, collaborative, supporting and respectful environment. We are committed to fostering equality and equity across our Company and have a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and harassment. In accordance with this policy, we strive to recruit and hire employees based on qualifications and fit for a job and without regard to race, religion, nationality, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other status protected by law. We also have systems under which employees can report incidents confidentially or anonymously without fear of reprisal.
Regulatory Matters
We operate in a number of jurisdictions and are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions because we blend, manage, handle, store, sell, transport and arrange for the disposal of chemicals, hazardous materials and hazardous waste. These include, without limitation, laws regulating discharges of hazardous substances into the soil, air and water, blending, managing, handling, storing, selling, transporting and disposing of hazardous substances, investigation and remediation of contaminated properties and protecting the safety of our employees and others. Some of these laws and regulations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund"), the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA"), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"), among others. Some of our operations are required to hold environmental permits and licenses to be compliant and certain of our services businesses are also impacted by these laws. 
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, we are subject to various other laws and regulations around the world. For example, our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the US, as well as similar foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition, and such laws and regulations may impact potential business relationships or transactions with third parties in the future. We are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in Europe, the US and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Further, an increasing number of laws and regulations focused on hazardous products and substances could also impact our ability to distribute and sell certain products or require significant capital expenditures to meet regulatory requirements. With respect to the laws and regulations noted above, as well as other 
Table of Contents

applicable laws and regulations, our compliance programs may under certain circumstances involve material investments in the form of additional processes, training, personnel, information technology and capital.
Information related to government regulation applicable to our business is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including: (i) Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors"; (ii) Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and (iii) “Note 2: Significant accounting policies” and “Note 18: Commitments and contingencies” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sustainability
We expect that there will be a continued increase in demand for products, systems and services that meet growing customer and societal sustainability standards, expectations and preferences. We recognize that our ability to continue to provide these products and services requires our business to further advance environmentally and socially responsible means of operating, reflecting the challenges and opportunities presented through increased legal requirements, climate parameters and market developments.
We are focused on demonstrating our commitment to these expectations through our global sustainability goals, which help us focus on reducing our contribution to global climate change while addressing remediation, reducing resource use, progressing responsible sourcing and bringing more sustainable solutions to market. In 2018, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, reaffirming our ongoing commitments to responsible business, and in 2019 adopted ‘Advancing a Circular Economy’ as a goal to 2021. In 2021, we developed and shared longer term Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) goals to 2025, 2030 and 2050. Throughout 2022 we continued to implement our strategies to drive progress on these goals.
We incorporate ESG initiatives into our business values and priorities of safety, sustainability and value creation. We continually strive to improve our industry leading safety record, reduce our environmental impact and increase transparency. In 2022, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to ESG practices and our purpose to help keep our communities healthy, fed, clean and safe with net sales of 8% related to food ingredients, 7% related to homecare and industrial cleaning, 5% related to pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products, 4% related to industrial and municipal water treatment and 2% related to chemical waste removal. In 2022, we dedicated resources to supporting our customers on their sustainability journeys, enhanced our sustainable and natural products portfolio and focused on developing sustainable formulations and services.
Intellectual Property
We consider intellectual property, particularly trade secrets and know-how, as important to our success. We hold some patents and own numerous trademarks in multiple jurisdictions. Further, we have various patent and trademark applications pending in jurisdictions worldwide. Although we consider our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to constitute valuable assets, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon an individual patent, trademark, copyright or trade secret.
Significant Customers
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in any of the years presented.
Other
No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
