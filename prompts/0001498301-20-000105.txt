Item 1. Business.
General
The Company is a national specialty retailer of apparel for women and tween girls. The Company's operations consist of its direct channel operations and approximately 2,500 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico as of August 1, 2020. The Company had annual revenues for Fiscal 2020 of approximately $3.7 billion. 
Recent Developments
In March of Fiscal 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease ("COVID-19") a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. To date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national, state, and local authorities. In response to those shutdowns the Company took a number of steps, some of which included a temporary closure of our retail stores, which had a significant impact on our Net sales and liquidity in the second half of Fiscal 2020. Other steps were taken to mitigate at least a portion of the impact of the temporary store closures, such as temporary associate furloughs and temporary suspension of rent payments. However, given the Company's significant indebtedness, which primarily consisted of its Term Loan, and borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement, as well as obligations related to its retail store leases, on July 23, 2020 (the “Petition Date”), the Company and certain of the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries commenced voluntary cases (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United 
States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constitutes an event of default under the Company’s Term Loan and Amended Revolving Credit Agreement, resulting in the automatic and immediate acceleration of the outstanding obligations thereunder.
While operating as a debtor-in-possession pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we may sell, or otherwise dispose of or liquidate, assets or settle liabilities, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or as otherwise permitted in the ordinary course of business, for amounts other than those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Further, a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is likely to materially change the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities reported in our audited financial statements. The outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and are dependent upon factors that are outside of the Company’s control, including actions of the Bankruptcy Court and the Company’s creditors. There can be no assurance that the Company will confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 Cases. We expect that our equity holders could experience a complete loss on their investment, depending on the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. The terms of the restructuring support agreement contemplates that the Company’s common stock will be canceled. We caution that trading in our securities, including our common stock, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for our common stock may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of our securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. For more detail on the Chapter 11 Cases, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued operations 
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Company completed its previously announced wind down of its Dressbarn brand. In addition, on May 6, 2019, the Company and Maurices Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“maurices”) and wholly owned subsidiary of ascena, completed the transaction contemplated by the previously-announced Stock Purchase Agreement with Viking Brand Upper Holdings, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“Viking”) and an affiliate of OpCapita LLP, providing for, among other things, the sale by ascena of maurices to Viking (the “Transaction”). Effective upon the closing of the Transaction, ascena received cash proceeds of approximately $210 million and a 49.6% ownership interest in the operations of maurices, consisting of interests in Viking preferred and common stock. As a result of these actions, the results of both brands, which previously constituted the Value Fashion segment, are now reported in discontinued operations, which concluded the reporting of the Value Fashion segment.

Omni-channel 
To support its omni-channel strategy, the Company's brands are consolidated into one shared distribution network and operate on a shared direct channel platform. The platform allows the brands to (i) provide customers a seamless omni-channel shopping experience in-store and online, (ii) integrate their marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance the capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions. These efforts have increased the Company's e-commerce penetration from 22% in Fiscal 2016 to 47% in Fiscal 2020. Additionally, the Company operates distribution and fulfillment centers in Etna, Ohio, Greencastle, Indiana, and Riverside, California. 
The Company's brands sell products online through social media and their direct channel sites:
•Ann Taylor – www.anntaylor.com and factory.anntaylor.com
•LOFT – www.LOFT.com, outlet.loft.com and www.louandgrey.com
•Lane Bryant – www.lanebryant.com
•Catherines – www.catherines.com

Store Locations
The Company's stores are typically open seven days a week and most evenings. As of August 1, 2020, the Company operated approximately 2,500 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Ann Taylor and LOFT have stores in 42 and 48 states, respectively, as well as the District of Columbia, Canada and Puerto Rico. In addition, LOFT has five international franchise stores. Lane Bryant and Catherines have stores located in 47 and 43 states, respectively. Justice has stores in 46 states and Canada as well as 91 international franchise stores.

Some of the leases contain renewal options and termination clauses, particularly in the early years of a lease, which are exercisable if specified sales volumes are not achieved. 
As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and the 363 Sales, the number of store locations and square footage is expected to significantly decrease during Fiscal 2021.

In connection with the Company's efforts to right-size its cost structure, the Company continues to review its existing store portfolio which has resulted in rent concessions and closure of stores. The Company continues to renegotiate its store leases where possible and expects such negotiations to continue in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of stores is expected to significantly decrease during Fiscal 2021. See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.
Trademarks

The Company has U.S. Trademark Registration Certificates and trademark applications pending for the operating names of the Company's stores and its major private label merchandise brands. The Company believes its trademarks such as ANN TAYLOR®, LOFT®, LOU & GREY®, JUSTICE®, LANE BRYANT®, CACIQUE®, CATHERINES®, and "&®" are essential to the continued success of its business. The Company intends to maintain its trademarks and related registrations and vigorously protect them against infringement. 
International Operations

As of August 1, 2020, the Company operated stores across three brands in Canada (Justice (38), LOFT (7), and Ann Taylor (4)). Additionally, as of August 1, 2020, Justice and LOFT had 91 and five international franchise stores, respectively, operated under franchise agreements where we earn licensing revenue. International revenue from company-operated stores and franchised stores accounts for approximately 2% of consolidated annual net sales. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the company closed all of its operated stores in Canada during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 and expects to exit its international stores and franchises during Fiscal 2021. 
Sourcing

Prior to Fiscal 2020, the Company's brands source their products through one of three channels - ascena's internal sourcing group, third-party buying agents, or directly from market vendors. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Company announced a reorganization of its sourcing operation in connection with its cost reduction initiatives. As a result of the reorganization, the Company closed and ceased regular business operations for the offices in South Korea, China and India effective November 1, 2019. 
By the end of second quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Company also completed the transition of production from ascena’s internal sourcing group to an agent or direct vendor model and the internal sourcing group no longer provides sourcing activities for affiliated companies in the United States and Canada. The internal sourcing group continues to provide sourcing activities to certain non-affiliates. The Company continues to source through third-party buying agents or directly from market vendors. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed to market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends.
Merchandise Vendors

The Company purchases its merchandise from many domestic and foreign suppliers. It has no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of its suppliers, and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier as no third-party supplier accounts for more than 10% of our merchandise purchases. The Company believes that it has good working relationships with its suppliers.
Merchandising and Design
The Company continues to focus on building its merchandising and design functions to align with its market position. The merchandising and design teams determine inventory needs for the upcoming season in response to fast changing fashion trends and customer preferences. Over the last few years, the Company has made substantial investments to acquire and retain merchandising and design talent allowing it to differentiate its fashion offerings, which it believes is a critical enabler for long-term success. 
Office and Distribution Centers

For a detailed discussion of the Company's office and distribution centers, see Part I, Item 2 “Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated by reference herein.
Information Technology Systems

The Company continues to make ongoing investments in its information technology systems to support its strategies in omni-channel, merchandise procurement, inventory management and supply chain. Our information technology systems make the design, marketing, importing and distribution of our products more efficient by providing common platforms for, among other things, order processing, product and design information, and financial information. 
Advertising and Marketing
The Company uses a combination of broad-based and targeted marketing and advertising strategies to effectively define, evolve, and promote our brands. These strategies are designed to deliver a personalized and relevant shopping experience for our customers and include customer research, advertising and promotional events, window and in-store marketing materials, direct mail marketing, Internet and social media marketing, lifestyle magazines, and other means of communication.
Customer Relationship Management
The Company continues to focus on building our customer relationships and promoting customer loyalty through various programs including brand-specific loyalty and credit card programs. Customers shopping at our brands who are enrolled in our loyalty programs earn reward points that are redeemable toward future purchases. Our brands also offer credit card programs to eligible customers providing additional discounts and promotional offers. These programs provide opportunities to attract new customers, retain and enhance existing customer relationships, and deliver a more personalized shopping experience through a better understanding of our customers' preferences and shopping behaviors. 
Community Service
ascena and its brands have a rich history of giving. Together, the Company has a shared commitment to our associates and the women and girls whom we serve. We support our associates through our ascenaCARES programs, which reflects our culture and the philanthropic efforts taking place within our organization. Through cause-marketing campaigns, our brands are committed to the communities in which we live and work. Whether through collective partnerships or individual brand outreach, we are committed to supporting women and girls to live confidently in their own unique ways. More information about our charitable giving, including the non-profit partners we support, is available at www.ascenaretail.com.
Competition
The retail apparel industry is highly competitive and increasingly fragmented. The Company competes with numerous retailers, including department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and Internet-based retailers, on pricing, styles and fulfillment capability. Our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts, channel shifts and changes in customer preferences. Some of our competitors operate at a lower cost structure, and are able to offer better pricing; others have more sophisticated direct channel or omni-channel capabilities. Examples of our competitive set include but are not limited to Gap Inc., Amazon, Walmart, Macy’s, JCPenney, Target and TJX Companies. Other competitors may enter the markets we serve. If the Company fails to compete successfully, it could face continued sales declines and may need to offer greater discounts to our customers, which could result in decreased profitability. The Company is working aggressively to differentiate our brands and our assortments to reinforce the value proposition it delivers by focusing on our target customers and by offering up-to-date fashion, unique experiences, superior customer service and shopping convenience across our multiple sales channels. 
Employees 

As of August 1, 2020, the Company had approximately 35,000 employees, 26,000 of whom worked on a part-time basis. The Company typically adds temporary employees during peak selling periods, which vary throughout the year at each of its brands, and adjusts the hours they work to coincide with holiday shopping patterns. Additionally, none of the Company's employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreement, except for approximately 10 employees of Lane Bryant who are represented by unions. The Company believes that it has good working relations with its employees and unions.
As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and the 363 Sales, the number of employees is expected to significantly decrease during Fiscal 2021.
