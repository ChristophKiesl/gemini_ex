Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
Wendy’s is primarily engaged in the business of operating, developing and franchising a system of distinctive quick-service restaurants serving high quality food. Wendy’s opened its first restaurant in Columbus, Ohio in 1969. Today, Wendy’s is the #2 quick-service restaurant company in the hamburger sandwich segment in the United States (the “U.S.”) based on traffic share*, and the third largest globally with 6,828 restaurants in the United States and 30 foreign countries and U.S. territories as of January 3, 2021. (*Based on The NPD Group CREST® data for the twelve months ended December 2020.)
At January 3, 2021, there were 5,881 Wendy’s restaurants in operation in the United States. Of these restaurants, 361 were operated by the Company and 5,520 were operated by a total of 228 franchisees. In addition, at January 3, 2021, there were 947 Wendy’s restaurants in operation in 30 foreign countries and U.S. territories, all of which were franchised. 
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at One Dave Thomas Blvd., Dublin, Ohio 43017, and its telephone number is (614) 764-3100.
Corporate History
The Wendy’s Company’s corporate predecessor was incorporated in Ohio in 1929 and was reincorporated in Delaware in June 1994. Effective September 29, 2008, in conjunction with the Wendy’s Merger (as defined below), the Company’s corporate name was changed from Triarc Companies, Inc. to Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. (“Wendy’s/Arby’s”). Effective July 5, 2011, in connection with the Company’s sale of Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Arby’s”), the Company’s corporate name was changed to The Wendy’s Company. 
Merger with Wendy’s
On September 29, 2008, Triarc Companies, Inc. and Wendy’s International, Inc. completed their merger (the “Wendy’s Merger”) in an all-stock transaction in which Wendy’s shareholders received 4.25 shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s Class A common stock for each Wendy’s common share owned. In the Wendy’s Merger, approximately 377,000,000 shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s Class A common stock were issued to Wendy’s shareholders. In addition, effective on the date of the Wendy’s Merger, Wendy’s/Arby’s Class B common stock was converted into Class A common stock. In connection with the May 28, 2009 amendment and restatement of Wendy’s/Arby’s Certificate of Incorporation, Wendy’s/Arby’s Class A common stock was redesignated as “Common Stock.”
Sale of Arby’s
On July 4, 2011, the Company completed the sale of 100% of the common stock of Arby’s to ARG IH Corporation (“ARG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARG Holding Corporation (“ARG Parent”), for $130.0 million in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 18.5% of the common stock of ARG Parent (through which the Company indirectly retained an 18.5% interest in Arby’s). Our 18.5% equity interest was diluted to 12.3% on February 5, 2018, when a subsidiary of ARG Parent acquired Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. As a result, our diluted ownership interest included both the Arby’s® and Buffalo Wild Wings® brands under the newly formed combined company, Inspire Brands, Inc. (“Inspire Brands”). On August 16, 2018, the Company sold its remaining 12.3% ownership interest to Inspire Brands for $450.0 million. (Arby’s is a registered trademark of Arby’s IP Holder, LLC and Buffalo Wild Wings is a registered trademark of Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc.) 
Fiscal Year
The Company’s fiscal reporting periods consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) “the year ended January 3, 2021” or “2020,” which consisted of 53 weeks, (2) “the year ended December 29, 2019” or “2019,” which consisted of 52 weeks, and (3) “the year ended December 30, 2018” or “2018,” which consisted of 52 weeks.
Business Strategy
Wendy’s long-term growth opportunities include investing in accelerated global growth through (1) building our breakfast daypart, (2) continued implementation of consumer-facing digital platforms and technologies and (3) expanding the Company’s footprint through targeted U.S. expansion and accelerated international expansion through same-restaurant sales growth and new restaurant development. Wendy’s vision is to become the world’s most thriving and beloved restaurant brand.
Business Segments
The Company is comprised of the following segments: (1) Wendy’s U.S., (2) Wendy’s International and (3) Global Real Estate & Development. Wendy’s U.S. includes the operation and franchising of Wendy’s restaurants in the U.S. and derives its revenues from sales at Company-operated restaurants and royalties, fees and advertising fund collections from franchised restaurants. Wendy’s International includes the franchising of Wendy’s restaurants in countries and territories other than the U.S. and derives its revenues from royalties, fees and advertising fund collections from franchised restaurants. Global Real Estate & Development includes real estate activity for owned sites and sites leased from third parties, which are leased and/or subleased to franchisees, and also includes our share of the income of our Canadian restaurant real estate joint venture (“TimWen”). In addition, Global Real Estate & Development earns fees from facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers (“Franchise Flips”) and providing other development-related services to franchisees. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 herein and Note 26 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for segment financial information.
The Wendy’s Restaurant System
The revenues from our restaurant business are derived from two principal sources: (1) sales at Company-operated restaurants and (2) franchise-related revenues, including royalties, national advertising funds contributions, rents and franchise fees received from Wendy’s franchised restaurants. Company-operated restaurants comprised approximately 5% of the total Wendy’s system as of January 3, 2021.
Restaurant Openings and Closings
During 2020, Wendy’s opened seven new Company-operated restaurants and closed two generally underperforming Company-operated restaurants. During 2020, Wendy’s franchisees opened 140 new restaurants and closed 105 generally underperforming restaurants.
The following table sets forth the number of Wendy’s restaurants in operation at the beginning and end of each fiscal year from 2018 to 2020:

 | 2020 | 2019 | | 2018
Restaurants open at beginning of period | 6,788 | | 6,711 | | 6,634
Restaurants opened during period | 147 | | 182 | | 159 
Restaurants closed during period | (107) | | (105) | | (82) 
Restaurants open at end of period | 6,828 | | 6,788 | | 6,711

Restaurant Operations
Each Wendy’s restaurant offers an extensive menu specializing in hamburger sandwiches and featuring filet of chicken breast sandwiches, which are prepared to order with the customer’s choice of condiments. Wendy’s menu also includes chicken nuggets, chili, french fries, baked potatoes, freshly prepared salads, soft drinks, Frosty® desserts and kids’ meals. In addition, Wendy’s restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a limited time basis. In March 2020, Wendy’s entered the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system. Wendy’s breakfast menu features a variety of breakfast sandwiches, biscuits and croissants, sides such as seasoned potatoes, oatmeal bars and seasonal fruit, and a beverage platform that includes hot coffee, cold brew iced coffee and our vanilla and chocolate Frosty-ccino iced coffee.
Free-standing Wendy’s restaurants generally include a pick-up window in addition to a dining room. In each of 2018 and 2019, approximately two-thirds of sales at Company-operated restaurants occurred through the pick-up window. In 2020, pick-up window sales represented approximately 83% of sales at Company-operated restaurants, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wendy’s strives to maintain quality and uniformity throughout all restaurants by publishing detailed specifications for food products, preparation and service, continual in-service training of employees, restaurant operational audits and field visits from Wendy’s supervisors. In the case of franchisees, field visits are made by Wendy’s personnel who review operations, including quality, service and cleanliness and make recommendations to assist in compliance with Wendy’s specifications.
Supply Chain, Distribution and Purchasing
As of January 3, 2021, three independent processors (five total production facilities) supplied all of the beef used by Wendy’s restaurants in the United States. In addition, six independent processors (14 total production facilities) supplied all of the chicken used by Wendy’s restaurants in the United States. In addition, there was one main in-line distributor of food, packaging and beverage products, excluding breads, that serviced approximately 67% of Wendy’s restaurants in the United States and four additional in-line distributors that, in the aggregate, serviced approximately 32% of Wendy’s restaurants in the United States. Except as discussed below, Wendy’s and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, fixtures or other products that are necessary to maintain restaurant operations, and Wendy’s anticipates no such shortages of products and believes that alternate suppliers and distribution sources are available. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to interruptions in the delivery of certain products to Wendy’s restaurants. For example, we experienced disruptions to our beef supply beginning in early May 2020 as beef suppliers across North America faced production challenges. As a result, some menu items were occasionally in short supply at some Wendy’s system restaurants. While we and our supply chain partners effectively managed through this disruption and the beef supply subsequently returned to normal levels across the Wendy’s system, there can be no assurances that we will not see similar disruptions in the future. Suppliers and distributors to the Wendy’s system must comply with United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulations governing the manufacture, packaging, storage, distribution and sale of all food and packaging products.
Wendy’s has a purchasing co-op relationship structure with its franchisees that establishes Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. (“QSCC”). QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system volume. QSCC’s supply chain management facilitates the continuity of supply and provides consolidated purchasing efficiencies while monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the Wendy’s supply chain in the United States and Canada. Wendy’s and its franchisees pay sourcing fees to third-party vendors on certain products sourced by QSCC. Such sourcing fees are remitted by these vendors to QSCC and are the primary means of funding QSCC’s operations. Should QSCC’s sourcing fees exceed its expected needs, QSCC’s board of directors may return some or all of the excess to its members in the form of a patronage dividend.
Wendy’s does not sell food or restaurant supplies to its franchisees.
Quality Assurance
Wendy’s quality assurance program is designed to verify that the food products supplied to our restaurants are processed in a safe, sanitary environment and in compliance with our food safety and quality standards. Wendy’s quality assurance personnel conduct multiple sanitation and production audits throughout the year for all of our core menu product processing facilities, which include beef, chicken, pork, buns, french fries, Frosty® dessert ingredients and produce. Animal welfare audits are also conducted at all beef, chicken and pork facilities to confirm compliance with our required animal welfare and handling policies and procedures. In addition to our facility audit program, weekly samples of beef, chicken and other core menu products from our distribution centers are randomly sampled and analyzed by a third-party laboratory to test conformance to our quality specifications. Wendy’s representatives, including third party auditors, regularly conduct evaluations and inspections of all Company-operated and franchise restaurants to test conformance to our sanitation, food safety and operational requirements. Wendy’s has the right to terminate franchise agreements if franchisees fail to comply with quality standards. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted and evolved certain of our audits which were traditionally conducted onsite, taking advantage of various virtual tools and resources to engage effectively with our suppliers. We also reviewed and reinforced our strict policies and procedures related to food safety procedures, personal hygiene standards, handwashing requirements and sanitation protocols through frequent communications and retraining, and instituted a brand standard that restaurant employees should wear a mask or face covering and service gloves while working, unless an exception applies. 
Information Technology
Wendy’s relies on computer systems and information technology to conduct its business. Wendy’s utilizes both commercially available third-party software and proprietary software owned by the Company to run the point-of-sale and kitchen delivery functions and certain other consumer-facing and back-office functions in Wendy’s restaurants. Wendy’s has invested significant resources to focus on consumer-facing technology, including installing a single point-of-sale system for Wendy’s U.S. and Canadian restaurants, activating mobile ordering via Wendy’s mobile apps, launching the Wendy’s Rewards loyalty program and establishing delivery arrangements with third-party vendors for Wendy’s U.S. and Canadian restaurants. We believe our digital platforms are critical to creating a more seamless user experience, providing insights to enhance our relationship with customers and meeting consumer demand for customization, speed and convenience. In December 2019, Wendy’s implemented a plan to realign and reinvest resources in our IT organization to strengthen our ability to accelerate growth. We are partnering with a third-party global IT consultant on this new structure to leverage their global capabilities and enable a more seamless integration between our digital and corporate IT assets.
Trademarks and Service Marks
Wendy’s or its subsidiaries have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in international jurisdictions, some of which include Wendy’s®, Old Fashioned Hamburgers® and Quality Is Our Recipe®. Wendy’s believes that these and other related marks are of material importance to its business. Domestic trademarks and service marks have their next required maintenance filings at various times from 2021 to 2031 in order to keep such registrations in force, while international trademarks and service marks have various durations of ten to 15 years. Wendy’s generally intends to maintain and renew its trademarks and service mark registrations in accordance with applicable deadlines.
Wendy’s entered into an Assignment of Rights Agreement with the Company’s founder, Dave Thomas, and his wife dated as of November 5, 2000 (the “Assignment”). Wendy’s had used Mr. Thomas, who was Senior Chairman of the Board until his death on January 8, 2002, as a spokesperson and focal point for its products and services for many years. With the efforts and attributes of Mr. Thomas, Wendy’s has, through its extensive investment in the advertising and promotional use of Mr. Thomas’ name, likeness, image, voice, caricature, endorsement rights and photographs (the “Thomas Persona”), made the Thomas Persona well known in the United States and throughout North America and a valuable asset for both Wendy’s and Mr. Thomas’ estate. Under the terms of the Assignment, Wendy’s acquired the entire right, title, interest and ownership in and to the Thomas Persona, including the sole and exclusive right to commercially use the Thomas Persona.
Research and Development
New product development is important to the Wendy’s system. The Company believes that the development and testing of new and improved products is critical to increasing sales, attracting new customers and differentiating the Wendy’s brand from competitors. The Company maintains a state-of-the-art research and development facility that includes a sensory lab, analytical labs, culinary kitchens and a Wendy’s test kitchen. The Company employs a variety of professionals from the culinary and food science disciplines to bring new and improved products to market. 
Seasonality
Wendy’s restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy’s average restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Because our business is moderately seasonal, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.
Competition
Each Wendy’s restaurant is in competition with other food service operations within the same geographical area. The quick-service restaurant segment is highly competitive and includes well-established competitors. Wendy’s competes with other restaurant companies and food outlets, primarily through the quality, variety, convenience, price and value perception of food products offered. The number and location of restaurants, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of marketing and new product development by Wendy’s and its competitors are also important factors. The price charged for each menu item may vary from market to market (and within markets) depending on competitive pricing and the local cost structure. Wendy’s also competes within the food service industry and the quick-service restaurant sector for customers as well as for personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.
Wendy’s competitive position is differentiated by a focus on quality, its use of fresh, never frozen ground beef* and fresh-cut vegetables in the United States, Canada and certain other countries, its unique and diverse menu, its promotional products, its choice of condiments and the atmosphere and décor of its restaurants. (*Fresh beef available in the contiguous U.S., Alaska and Canada.) Wendy’s continues to implement its Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy’s restaurants and building new Wendy’s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs, with plans for a significant number of new and reimaged restaurants in 2021 and beyond. The Image Activation program also differentiates the Company from its competitors by its emphasis on selection and performance of restaurant employees that provide friendly and engaged customer service in Wendy’s restaurants.
Many of the leading restaurant chains continue to focus on new restaurant development as one strategy to increase market share through increased consumer awareness and convenience. This results in increased competition for available development sites and higher development costs for those sites. Competitors also employ marketing strategies such as frequent use of price discounting, frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures. Continued price discounting, including the use of coupons and offers, in the quick-service restaurant industry and the emphasis on value menus could have an adverse impact on Wendy’s business. 
Other restaurant chains have also competed by offering high quality sandwiches made with fresh ingredients and artisan breads, and there are several emerging restaurant chains featuring high quality food served at in-line locations. Several chains have also sought to compete by targeting certain consumer groups, such as capitalizing on trends toward certain types of diets or dietary preferences (e.g., plant-based food, alternative proteins, low carbohydrate, low trans-fat, gluten free or antibiotic free) by offering menu items that are promoted as being consistent with such diets.
Additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases come from operators outside the restaurant industry. A number of major grocery chains offer fresh deli sandwiches and fully prepared food and meals to go as part of their deli sections. Some of these chains also have in-store cafes with service counters and tables where consumers can order and consume a full menu of items prepared especially for that portion of the operation. Additionally, convenience stores and retail outlets at gas stations frequently offer a wide variety of sandwiches and other foods.
Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets that sell food to be prepared at home. Competition with these chains and other outlets has increased due to the gap between the price of food at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants.
Technology and delivery are becoming increasingly critical parts of the restaurant consumer experience. In the quick-service restaurant category, technology initiatives include mobile interactive technology for brand and menu search information, mobile ordering, mobile payment, mobile offers, customer loyalty and rewards programs and other self-service technologies. An increasing number of restaurant chains have also introduced or expanded their restaurant delivery arrangements as another strategy to increase market share. If our digital commerce platforms or third-party delivery providers do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, cost, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to use those platforms or providers and our competitive position could be adversely impacted.
System Optimization
The Company’s system optimization initiative included a shift from Company-operated restaurants to franchised restaurants over time, through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as by facilitating Franchise Flips. During 2016, the Company completed the sale of 310 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, which resulted in the completion of its plan to reduce its ongoing Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total Wendy’s system.
While the Company has no plans to reduce its ownership below the approximately 5% level, it expects to continue to optimize the Wendy’s system by facilitating Franchise Flips, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of Wendy’s Image Activation program. Wendy’s generally retains a right of first refusal in connection with any proposed sale or transfer of franchised restaurants.
During 2018, the Company sold three Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and acquired 16 Wendy’s restaurants from franchisees. During 2019, the Company acquired five Wendy’s restaurants from franchisees. No Company-operated restaurants were sold to franchisees during 2019. One Company-operated restaurant was sold to a franchisee during 2020. In addition, during 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company facilitated Franchise Flips covering 54, 37 and 96 restaurants, respectively.
Franchising
As of January 3, 2021, 228 Wendy’s U.S. franchisees operated 5,520 franchised restaurants in 50 states and the District of Columbia, and 102 Wendy’s international franchisees operated 947 franchised restaurants in 30 foreign countries and U.S. territories. 
U.S. Franchise Arrangements
The rights and obligations governing the majority of franchised restaurants operating in the United States are set forth in the Wendy’s current Unit Franchise Agreement (the “Current Franchise Agreement”) (non-traditional locations may operate under an amended agreement). This agreement provides the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy’s restaurant upon a site accepted by Wendy’s and to use the Wendy’s system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Current Franchise Agreement provides for a 20-year term and a ten-year renewal subject to certain conditions. The initial term may be extended up to 25 years and the renewal extended up to 20 years for qualifying restaurants under the new restaurant development incentive and reimage programs described below in “Franchise Development and Other Relationships”. Wendy’s has in the past franchised under different agreements on a multi-unit basis; however, Wendy’s now grants new Wendy’s franchises on a unit-by-unit basis.
The Current Franchise Agreement requires that the franchisee pay a monthly royalty of 4.0% of sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement also typically requires that the franchisee pay Wendy’s an initial technical assistance fee. In the United States, the standard technical assistance fee required under a newly executed Current Franchise Agreement is currently $50,000 for each new restaurant opened.
The technical assistance fee is used to defray some of the costs to Wendy’s for training, start-up and transitional services related to new and existing franchisees acquiring Company-operated restaurants and in the development and opening of new restaurants. In certain limited instances (such as a reduced franchise agreement term or other unique circumstances), Wendy’s may charge a reduced technical assistance fee or may waive the technical assistance fee. Wendy’s does not select or employ personnel on behalf of franchisees.
International Franchise Arrangements
Wendy’s Restaurants of Canada Inc. (“WROC”), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy’s, holds master franchise rights for Canada. The rights and obligations governing the majority of franchised restaurants operating in Canada are set forth in a Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement (the “Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement”). This document provides the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy’s restaurant upon a site accepted by WROC and to use the Wendy’s system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement provides for a 20-year term and a ten-year renewal subject to certain conditions. The sub-franchisee pays to WROC a monthly royalty of 4.0% of sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement also typically requires that the franchisee pay WROC an initial technical assistance fee. The standard technical assistance fee is currently C$50,000 for each new restaurant opened.
Franchisees who wish to operate Wendy’s restaurants outside of the United States and Canada enter into franchise or license agreements with Wendy’s that generally provide franchise rights for each restaurant for an initial term of ten years or 20 years, depending on the country, and typically include a ten-year renewal provision, subject to certain conditions. The agreements grant a license to the franchisee to use the Wendy’s trademarks and know-how in the operation of a Wendy’s restaurant at a specified location. Generally, the franchisee pays Wendy’s an initial technical assistance fee or other per restaurant fee and monthly fees based on a percentage of gross monthly sales of each restaurant. In certain foreign markets, Wendy’s may grant the franchisee exclusivity to develop a territory in exchange for the franchisee undertaking to develop a specified number of new Wendy’s restaurants in the territory based on a negotiated schedule. In these instances, the franchisee generally pays Wendy’s an upfront development fee, annual development fees or a per restaurant development fee. In certain circumstances, Wendy’s may grant a franchisee the right to sub-franchise in a stated territory, subject to certain conditions.
Franchise Development and Other Relationships
In addition to its franchise and license agreements, Wendy’s also enters into development and/or relationship agreements with certain franchisees. The development agreement provides the franchisee with the right to develop a specified number of new Wendy’s restaurants using the Image Activation program design within a stated, non-exclusive territory for a specified period, subject to the franchisee meeting interim new restaurant development requirements. The relationship agreement 
addresses other aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, such as restrictions on operating competing restaurants, participation in brand initiatives such as the Image Activation program, employment of approved operators, confidentiality and restrictions on engaging in sale/leaseback or debt refinancing transactions without Wendy’s prior consent.
In order to promote new restaurant development, Wendy’s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for technical assistance fee waivers and reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened prior to December 31, 2022. In addition, Wendy’s has a restaurant development incentive program that provides for incremental reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants for existing franchisees that sign up for the program under a new development agreement, or through an extension of their existing development agreement, and commit to incremental development of new Wendy’s restaurants. Under any extended development agreements, franchisees are also eligible for technical assistance fee waivers for restaurants opened one year in advance of their original development schedule so long as the restaurants are opened prior to December 31, 2022. Wendy’s also provides franchisees with the option of an early 20-year or 25-year renewal of their franchise agreement upon completion of reimaging utilizing certain approved Image Activation reimage designs.
Franchised restaurants are required to be operated under uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection, quality and preparation of menu items, signage, decor, equipment, uniforms, suppliers, maintenance and cleanliness of premises and customer service. Wendy’s monitors franchisee operations and inspects restaurants periodically to ensure that required practices and procedures are being followed.
See Note 7 and Note 21 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein, and the information under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” herein, for information regarding certain guarantee obligations, reserves, commitments and contingencies involving franchisees.
Advertising and Marketing
In the United States and Canada, Wendy’s advertises nationally through national advertising funds on network and cable television programs, including nationally televised events, and advertises locally primarily through regional network and cable television, radio and social media. Wendy’s maintains two national advertising funds established to collect and administer funds contributed for use in advertising through television, radio, the Internet and a variety of promotional campaigns, including the increasing use of social media. Separate national advertising funds are administered for Wendy’s United States and Canadian restaurant locations. Contributions to the national advertising funds are required to be made by both Company-operated and franchised restaurants and are based on a percentage of restaurant retail sales. In addition to the contributions to the national advertising funds, Wendy’s requires additional contributions to be made for both Company-operated and franchised restaurants based on a percentage of restaurant retail sales for the purpose of local and regional advertising programs. Required franchisee contributions to the national advertising funds and for local and regional advertising programs are governed by the Current Franchise Agreement in the United States and by the Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement in Canada. Required contributions by Company-operated restaurants for advertising and promotional programs are at the same percentage of retail sales as franchised restaurants within the Wendy’s system. As of January 3, 2021, the contribution rate for U.S. restaurants was generally 3.5% of retail sales for national advertising and 0.5% of retail sales for local and regional advertising. As of January 3, 2021, the contribution rate for Canadian restaurants was generally 3.0% of retail sales for national advertising and 1.0% of retail sales for local and regional advertising, with the exception of Quebec, for which there is no national advertising contribution rate and the local and regional advertising contribution rate is 4.0% of retail sales. See Note 24 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information regarding advertising.
Human Capital
At Wendy’s, our vision is to become the world’s most thriving and beloved restaurant brand and every day we strive to live our purpose of creating joy and opportunity through food, family and community. Our restaurants, our food, and the value and service we provide to our customers are all integral, but ultimately it is our people that help us deliver our brand promise of “Fast Food Done Right” every single day.
From day one, the Wendy’s business has always been of, for and about people. Respect, equity and fair treatment for our team members, franchisees, supplier partners and vendors is a central part of our business. So is staying true to our values established by our founder Dave Thomas, which include Doing the Right Thing, Treating People with Respect and Giving Something Back. We strive to bring those values to life through daily interactions with our team members and customers and in the communities where we do business. We also continue to invest in our people to ensure we are able to attract, hire and retain great talent throughout our organization. We measure our effectiveness in these areas using various tools and metrics, 
including administering an employee engagement survey twice a year and tracking our employee turnover rates compared to others in the restaurant industry. During 2020, we continued to outperform our peer group benchmarks and we saw consistent progress in both increased employee engagement and lower turnover. 
As of January 3, 2021, the Company was comprised of approximately 14,000 employees, of which approximately two-thirds were part-time, and one-third were full-time. The vast majority of our employees are located in the United States and work in our Company-operated restaurants within our Wendy’s U.S. business segment. Outside of our restaurants, our largest population of employees work in our field support organization or at our Restaurant Support Center in Dublin, Ohio. Our workforce represents nearly all demographics, with diversity in age, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and sexual orientation. Specifically, we have more women than men, more employees that identify as persons of color than white, and more employees under the age of 30 than any other age group.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe our strategic focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) helps the Company deliver on our values as well as support our financial performance and global growth strategy. Creating and fostering inclusive work environments and teams allows us to create an engaging and welcoming culture for our employees, which we believe positively affects the quality of products and experience we deliver to our customers. 
Our DE&I strategy is built around three pillars. First, we seek to increase our knowledge and accountability to ensure we have a diverse and inclusive mindset. Next, we work to ensure our recruiting and hiring initiatives are reaching a broad audience, so that our workforce represents the communities in which we serve. Third, we strive to expand and develop a strong, diverse pipeline of talent by providing opportunities for growth and development at all levels of our organization. Our senior management and Board of Directors serve an integral role in our DE&I strategy, providing guidance and oversight.
We are fortunate to have several thriving Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which are voluntary employee-led groups, each sponsored by a Wendy’s senior leadership team member. Our ERGs serve an important role in support of our DE&I strategy, creating forums for learning and inclusion, opportunities to celebrate different backgrounds, empowering employees to bring their authentic self to work, and creating leadership and professional development opportunities. Our ERGs focus on employees and allies who identify as Women (Women of Wendy’s), LGBTQ+ (WeQual), Military Veterans & Families (WeVets), Culturally Diverse (WCDN), Black (WeBERG) and Young Professional (WenGEN). 
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to providing market-competitive and equitable pay and benefits to attract and retain great talent. We enable this by benchmarking and analyzing pay and benefits both externally and internally. In addition to competitive hourly rates and base salaries, all general managers and district managers of our Company-operated restaurants are eligible for performance-based cash incentive bonuses, along with all corporate management staff. For our restaurant-level employees, we offer the potential for raises at least twice annually based on individual performance reviews. At Wendy’s, we are committed to providing pay equity for all employees, regardless of gender or ethnicity.
We offer a robust set of benefits to help our employees and their families stay healthy and effectively manage spend related to health and financial well-being. This includes standard benefits, such as medical and prescription drug, dental and vision, 401(k) savings and retirement plans and health savings accounts. In addition, we provide access to our Employee Assistance Program, paid sick leave, paid parental leave and adoption benefits for all employees globally at all levels. For employees based in the U.S., we also provide telehealth visits at no cost to employees enrolled in a Wendy’s health care plan, and telehealth access at a discounted cost to all employees not enrolled in a Company health care plan.
Safety and Well-Being
We are committed to providing safe work environments and providing our employees with the resources they need to promote their well-being. Given the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 presented a unique set of challenges. We took several actions during the year to support the safety and well-being of our employees, such as providing enhanced safety training and personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing measures, the ability to take advantage of emergency paid sick leave, recognition pay for our front-line restaurant employees and protection of bonus payments for our restaurant General Managers and District Managers when the COVID-19 pandemic was impacting financial performance outside of the managers’ control.
Talent Development
To set our employees up for success and help them achieve their personal development needs and career growth, we invest in training and development programs at all levels within the Company. We also leverage annual processes that support individual performance planning, individual professional development planning and a broad review of talent throughout our organization. Restaurant-level employees take advantage of an extensive online learning curriculum, as well as hands-on training led by crew trainers, managers and field support staff. Restaurant managers and multi-unit operators participate in Wendy’s University, which includes targeted training to develop management and leadership skills. Wendy’s University also provides targeted programming for corporate management staff, including diversity training, people manager training, leadership dialogues and the opportunity to participate in third party conferences and training.
We also share information about our people and human capital initiatives on our website at www.wendys.com/what-we-value, in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility report and on The Square DealTM Wendy’s Blog at www.squaredealblog.com.

Governmental Regulations
U.S. Operations
The Company and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the operation of our respective businesses, including laws and regulations relating to building and zoning, health, fire and safety, sanitation, food preparation, nutritional content and menu labeling, advertising, information security, privacy and consumer protection, as well as laws, regulations, recommendations and guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The Company is also subject to federal, state and local laws governing labor and employment matters, including minimum wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions, family leave and health care mandates, union organizing, work authorization requirements, insurance and workers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws applicable to Company employees, and our franchisees are subject to labor and employment laws with respect to their employees. Additionally, the Company and our franchisees are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws that provide civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of public accommodations and other areas.
The Company’s franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC requires that franchisors furnish a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) containing certain information to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement. Several states require registration and disclosure of the FDD in connection with franchise offers and sales and have laws regulating the franchisor-franchisee relationship. These state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of franchise agreements. The Company believes that our FDD, together with applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the FTC’s franchise rules and applicable state franchise laws.
International Operations
Internationally, the Company and our franchisees are subject to national, provincial and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those impacting us and our franchisees in the U.S., including laws and regulations concerning franchises, labor and employment, building and zoning, health, fire and safety, sanitation, food preparation, nutritional content, menu labeling, advertising, information security, privacy and consumer protection, as well as laws, regulations, recommendations and guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wendy’s restaurants outside the U.S. are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. The Company believes that our international franchise disclosure documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the applicable countries. 
Environmental Matters
The Company’s operations, including the selection and development of properties that we own or lease and any construction or improvements made at those properties, are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations concerning the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. Our properties are sometimes located in developed commercial or industrial areas and might previously have been occupied by more environmentally significant operations, such as gas stations. Environmental laws and regulations sometimes require owners or operators of contaminated property to remediate that property, regardless of fault, and could give rise to significant fines, penalties and liabilities, as well as third-party claims. The Company believes that our restaurant operations comply substantially with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
Legal Matters
The Company is involved in litigation and claims incidental to our business. We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when payment is probable and reasonably estimable. We believe we have adequate accruals for continuing operations for all of our legal and environmental matters. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information. 
The Company does not believe that compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, or the outcome of any legal matters in which we are involved, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, the Company cannot predict what laws or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks relating to legal and regulatory requirements, litigation and claims and related matters affecting our business.
