Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
As used in this annual report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires or indicates, references to "the Company," "our company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to The New Home Company Inc. and its subsidiaries.  You should read the following in conjunction with the section titled "Risk Factors", which is included in Part I, Item 1A in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
Our Company
 
We are a new generation homebuilder focused on the design, construction and sale of innovative and consumer-driven homes in major metropolitan areas within select growth markets in California and Arizona, including Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area, metro Sacramento and the greater Phoenix area.
 
We were founded in 2009, towards the end of an unprecedented downturn in the U.S. homebuilding industry, as The New Home Company LLC, which entity was formed in June 2009.  In January 2014, we converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and renamed our company The New Home Company Inc. when we completed our initial public offering of shares of our common stock. We believe our management team has extensive and complementary construction, design, marketing, development and entitlement expertise, as well as strong relationships with key land sellers within each of our local markets, and a reputation for quality building, which provide a competitive advantage in being able to acquire land, participate in and create masterplans, obtain entitlements and build quality homes.
 
We are organized into three reportable segments: Arizona homebuilding, California homebuilding and fee building. Our California homebuilding operation is comprised of divisions in Northern California and Southern California.  Our primary business focus is building and selling homes for our own account and we also have a meaningful fee building business. For financial information about our segments, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Homebuilding Operations
 
We are currently focused on identifying unique sites and creating communities that allow us to design, construct and sell consumer-driven, single-family detached and attached homes in major metropolitan areas in Southern California, metro Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay area and the greater Phoenix area. We seek sites where we are rewarded for thoughtful land planning and architecture, and additional defining characteristics of our markets generally include barriers to entry, job growth, high employment to building permit ratios and increasing populations, which can create growing demand for new housing. We perform consumer research that helps us create land plans and design homes that meet the needs and desires of our targeted buyers. We believe our approach to market research and construction expertise across an extensive product offering allows us the flexibility to pursue a wide array of land acquisition opportunities and appeals to a broad range of potential homebuyers, including entry-level, move-up, move-down and luxury customers. The homes that we and our unconsolidated joint ventures build range in price from approximately $300,000 to over $3 million, with home sizes ranging from approximately700 to 5,000 square feet. Our homebuilding operations are comprised of two reportable segments, Arizona homebuilding and California homebuilding.  Total homebuilding revenue contributed to86%, 76% and 75% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the average sales price of homes delivered from our wholly owned communities was approximately $927,000, $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively. We believe that customer-focused community creation and product development, our reputation for high quality construction, as well as exemplary customer service, are key components of the lifestyle connection we seek to establish with each homebuyer.
 
Additionally, we strive to enhance the home-buying experience and buyers’ personal investment in their homes by actively engaging them in the selection of design options and upgrades in many of our communities. We believe that our on-site design studios in such communities allow buyers to personalize our home offerings with dedicated designers who are knowledgeable about the attributes of the homes offered in the community. We believe that the active participation of buyers in selecting options and upgrades results in buyers becoming more personally invested in their homes. We also believe our emphasis on customer care provides us a competitive advantage. Our commitment to customer satisfaction is a key element of company culture, which fosters an environment where team members can innovate.
 
We seek to reduce upfront capital and exposure to land risk through the use of land options and other flexible land acquisition and development arrangements. The Company owned approximately 1,578 lots and had options to purchase an additional 1,123 lots as of December 31, 2019. We believe our lot option strategy allows us to leverage and establish a homebuilding platform focused on high-growth, land-constrained markets. In addition, we believe that our professional reputation and long-standing relationships with key land sellers, including masterplan community developers, brokers and other builders, as well as our land development joint venture partners, enable us to acquire well-positioned land parcels in our existing markets as well as new target markets.

Fee Building Operations
 
Our fee business is comprised primarily of building for third party landowners for a fee with such third party landowners paying or reimbursing the Company for all costs associated with construction. Our fee building segment also includes our management fee revenues that we receive for serving as the managing member or other similar role in our joint ventures. We believe our fee building business complements our homebuilding business, as most of the fee building occurs in what we believe are very attractive masterplan communities in Southern California and in a concentrated geographic area. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries is usually the general contractor for our and our unconsolidated joint ventures’ projects and engages third party subcontractors for home construction and land development.
 
The following table shows the percentage of each segment's revenue in relation to our consolidated total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.  For additional information related to geographic location of our homebuilding revenues, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Summary of Owned and Controlled Lots
 
As of December 31, 2019, we owned or controlled an aggregate of 2,701 lots in our homebuilding segment and 1,135 lots through our fee building segment. The following table presents certain information with respect to our wholly owned and fee building lots as of December 31, 2019.

Backlog
 
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, homes under contract, but not yet delivered ("backlog") totaled 149 and 191, respectively, with an estimated sales value of $125.8 million and $207.1 million, respectively. We expect to deliver all of the homes in backlog at December 31, 2019 during 2020 under existing home order contracts or through the replacement of an existing contract with a new home order contract. The estimated backlog sales value at December 31, 2019 may be impacted by, among other things, subsequent home order cancellations, incentives provided, and/or options and upgrades selected. 
Acquisition Process
 
Our land acquisition strategy focuses on purchasing entitled finished, or partially improved land sufficient for construction of homes over a two- to three-year period from the initiation of homebuilding activity. We also selectively acquire parcels that require land development activities. Our acquisition process generally includes the following steps aimed at reducing development and market cycle risk:

• | review of the status of entitlements and other governmental processing, including title reviews;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identification of target buyer and appropriate housing product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | determination of land plan to accommodate desired housing product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of environmental reviews and third-party market studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of detailed budgets for all cost categories;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of due diligence on the land parcel prior to committing to the acquisition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limitation on the size of an acquisition relative to the Company's pro forma capitalization; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | centralized acquisition procedure through a land committee and full Board approval process for larger acquisitions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Before purchasing a land parcel, we engage and work closely with outside architects and consultants to design our homes and communities.
 
We also differentiate our acquisition strategy based on whether the land is in a masterplan community, or part of a larger development. For land which is not part of a larger development or masterplan, we generally enter into a purchase agreement with the land owner and deliver a deposit, which becomes nonrefundable upon the expiration of a specified due diligence period. The closing is generally tied to the date on which we have obtained development entitlements for the land. For land which is part of a larger development being developed by a master developer, we generally enter into a purchase agreement with the master developer and pay a deposit that becomes nonrefundable upon expiration of the due diligence period. The closing in master developments is generally tied to the issuance of final land development entitlements and completion of certain infrastructure and other improvements by the master developer. In master developments we may acquire all of the land at the closing or we may acquire the land in "phases". In master developments we may be required to (a) pay to the master developer a share of our net profit in excess of a specified margin (b) pay to the master developer marketing fees and/or (c) grant the master developer the right to repurchase the land if we fail to develop the land in accordance with applicable development requirements or wish to sell the land in bulk. Our acquisition and development financing is generally obtained using one or more of the following: (i) proceeds from the sale of debt securities, (ii) unsecured lines of credit; (iii) secured acquisition and development loans; and/or (iv) land bank arrangements with providers who take title to the land at closing subject to agreements which obligate us to perform all development activities with respect to the land and provide us with an option to purchase the land.
 
Construction, Marketing and Sales Process
 
We typically develop communities in phases based upon projected sales. We seek to control the timing of construction of subsequent phases in the same community based on sales demand in prior phases. Our construction process is driven by sales contracts that often precede the start of the construction of homes, however, depending on the price point, product, and buyer demand we also engage in some speculative building. The determination that a potential home buyer is qualified to obtain the financing necessary to complete the purchase is an integral part of our process. Once qualified, our designers, which are often at on-site design centers, work with the buyer to tailor the home to meet the buyer’s needs and budget.
Land Development and Construction
 
We customarily acquire improved or unimproved land zoned for residential use. To control larger land parcels or gain access to certain desirable parcels, we sometimes form land development joint ventures with third parties in order to provide us with a pipeline of land to acquire from the joint venture when the lots are developed. If we purchase raw land or partially developed land, we will perform development work that may include negotiating with governmental agencies and local communities to obtain any necessary zoning, environmental and other regulatory approvals and permits, and constructing, as necessary, roads, water, sewer and drainage systems and recreational facilities like parks, community centers, pools, and hiking and biking trails.
 
  7 



The design of our homes must conform to zoning requirements, building codes and energy efficiency laws. As a result, we contract with a number of architects, engineers, and other consultants in connection with the design process. We act as a general contractor (and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries hold the general contractor's licenses in California and Arizona) with our supervisory employees coordinating most of the land development and construction work on a project. Independent architectural design, engineering and other consulting firms are generally engaged on a project-by-project basis to assist in project planning and community and home design, and subcontractors and trade partners are engaged to perform all of the physical development and construction work. Although we generally do not have long-term contractual commitments with our subcontractors, trade partners, suppliers or laborers, we maintain strong and long-standing relationships with many of our subcontractors and trade partners. We believe that our relationships with subcontractors and trade partners have been enhanced through involving them prior to the start of a new community, maintaining our schedules and making timely payments. By dealing fairly, we believe we are able to keep our key subcontractors and trade partners loyal to us.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
In connection with the sale and marketing of our homes, we make extensive use of advertising and other promotional activities, including through our website (www.NWHM.com), social-media, brochures, direct mail and other community-specific collateral materials. The information contained in, or that can be accessed through our website, is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
We primarily sell our homes through our own sales representatives and through the use of outside brokers. It is also fairly common that a third party broker representing a homebuyer receives co-broker commissions in connection with a sale. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries holds the corporate broker's licenses in California and Arizona. Our in-house sales force works from sales offices located in model homes or sales centers close to, or within each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with floor plan, price and community amenity information, construction timetables, and tours of model homes.
 
Generally, we build model homes at each project and have them professionally decorated and landscaped to display design features and options available for purchase in the design center. We believe that model homes play a significant role in helping homebuyers understand the efficiencies and value provided by each floor plan type. Structural changes in design from the model homes, other than those predetermined, are not generally permitted, but homebuyers may select various other optional construction and design amenities. The specific options selected for each community are based upon the price of the home and anticipated buyer preferences. Options include structural (room configurations or pre-determined additional square footage), electrical, plumbing and finish options (flooring, cabinets, fixtures). In certain communities, we may also offer turn-key landscape options. 
 
We typically sell homes using sales contracts that include cash deposits by the purchasers. Most homebuyers utilize long-term mortgage financing to purchase a home, and mortgage lenders will usually make loans only to qualified borrowers. Before entering into sales contracts, we pre-qualify many of our customers through a third party preferred mortgage provider. However, purchasers can generally cancel sales contracts if they are unable to sell their existing homes, if they fail to qualify for financing, or under certain other circumstances. For our communities, the cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow as a percentage of overall orders was 11%, 10% and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cancellation rates are subject to a variety of factors, including those beyond our control, such as adverse economic or housing market conditions and increases in mortgage interest rates. Cancellation rates have increased gradually over the last couple years which we believe is consistent with our transition to offering more affordable product, which generally has higher cancellation rates than move-up and luxury product offerings.
 
Quality Control and Customer Service
 
We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider quality and choice of materials in order to attempt to eliminate building deficiencies. The quality and workmanship of the subcontractors and trade partners we employ are monitored using our personnel and third-party consultants. We make regular inspections and evaluations of our subcontractors and trade partners to seek to ensure that our standards are met.
 
We utilize a third party quality control provider and maintain customer service staff whose role includes providing a positive experience for each customer throughout the delivery and post-delivery periods. These employees are responsible for providing after-sales customer service, including the coordination of warranty requests. Our quality and service initiatives include taking homebuyers on a comprehensive tour of their home during construction and prior to delivery. In addition, we generally use a third party, Eliant, to survey our homebuyers in order to improve our performance and evaluate our standards of quality and customer satisfaction.
 
  8 



Insurance and Warranty Program
 
We provide a limited one-year warranty to our homeowners covering workmanship and materials. In addition, we generally provide a more limited warranty, which generally ranges from a minimum of two years up to the period covered by the applicable statute of repose, that covers certain defined construction defects. The limited warranty covering construction defects is transferable to subsequent buyers and provides for the resolution of unresolved construction-related disputes through binding arbitration. Additionally, we have dedicated customer service staff that work with our homebuyers and coordinate with subcontractors and trade partners, as necessary, during the warranty period. While our subcontractors who perform our homebuilding work generally provide us with an indemnity for claims relating to their workmanship and materials, we also purchase general liability insurance that covers development and construction activity at each of our communities. Our subcontractors are usually covered by these programs through an owner-controlled insurance program, or "OCIP." Consultants such as engineers and architects are generally not covered by the OCIP but are required to maintain their own insurance. In general, we maintain insurance, subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions, to protect us against various risks associated with our activities, including, among others, general liability, "all-risk" property, construction defects, workers’ compensation, automobile, and employee fidelity. Our warranty and litigation reserves are presented on a gross basis before coverage from insurance, and expected recoveries from insurance carriers are presented as a receivable, the net result of which is equivalent to our expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts for warranty and construction defect claims.  For a further discussion of the risks associated with our warranty and insurance program, please see the risk factor under the heading "Risks Related to Our Business - We are subject to construction defect, warranty, and personal injury claims arising in the ordinary course of business that can be significant and could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations."
 
Seasonality and Cycles
 
We have experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements in each of our California and Arizona homebuilding reportable segments as well as our fee building reportable segment. We typically take orders for more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half, which creates additional working capital requirements in the second and third quarters to build our inventories to satisfy the deliveries in the second half of the year. Our revenues and cash flows (exclusive of the amount and timing of land purchases and land sales, if applicable) from homebuilding operations are generally higher in the second half of the calendar year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry. The homebuilding industry is cyclical. We continue to make investments in land, which is likely to utilize a significant portion of our cash resources, so long as we believe such investments will yield results that meet our investment criteria.
Labor and Raw Materials
 
Typically, the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, our industry experiences shortages in both raw materials and labor from time to time. Increases in the cost of building materials and subcontracted labor may reduce gross margins from home sales to the extent that market conditions prevent the recovery of increased costs through higher home sales prices. These shortages and delays may result in delays in the delivery of homes under construction, reduced gross margins from home sales, or both. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve favorable prices. In addition, the imposition of tariffs on building materials frequently impacts the cost of construction and increases in costs may not be recovered by raising home prices due to affordability and market demand constraints.
Joint Ventures
 
Our joint venture strategy has assisted in leveraging our entity-level capital and establishing a homebuilding and land development platform focused on high-growth, land-constrained markets. We own interests in our unconsolidated joint ventures that generally range from 5% to 35%. We also earn management fees from such joint ventures.
 
We serve as the administrative member, general partner, manager or managing member of each of our six homebuilding and four land development joint ventures. We do not, however, exercise control over the joint ventures, as the joint venture agreements generally provide our respective partners with the right to consent to certain actions. Under most joint venture agreements, certain major decisions must be approved by the applicable joint venture’s executive committee, which is comprised of both our representatives and representatives of our joint venture partners. In addition, some of our joint venture agreements grant both partners a buy-sell right pursuant to which, subject to certain exceptions, either partner may initiate procedures requiring the other partner to choose between selling its interest to the other partner or buying the other partner’s interest. Additional information related to our unconsolidated joint ventures is set forth in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations."  For a further discussion of the risks associated with our joint ventures, please see the risk factor regarding our joint venture investments under the heading "Risks Related to Financing and Indebtedness."

Fee Building Services
 
Although our primary business focus is building and selling homes for our own account, we also selectively provide general contracting, construction management and coordination services, sales and marketing services and escrow coordination services as part of agreements with third-parties and the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures. We refer to these projects as "fee building projects." For the year ended December 31, 2019, 96% of our fee building revenue represents billings to third-party land owners for general contracting and construction management services and 4% represents management fees from unconsolidated joint ventures and third-party land owners for construction and sales management services. Our services with respect to fee building projects may include design, development, construction, escrow, and sales and marketing services. We earn revenue on our fee building projects either as a flat fee for the project or as a percentage of the cost or revenue of the project depending upon the terms of the agreement with our customer. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, fee building revenue contributed to 14%, 24% and 25%, respectively, of total revenue.  The Company’s fee building revenues have historically been concentrated with a small number of customers.  We have several fee building agreements with Irvine Pacific, LP and revenues from this customer totaled 14%, 23%, and 25% of our total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our billings to this customer are dependent upon such customer’s decision to proceed with construction and the agreements can be canceled at any time. We cannot predict whether these agreements will continue in the future or the current pace of construction, and the loss of these billings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Fee Building" and Note 1 "Revenue Recognition - Fee Building" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this revenue concentration.
Competition
 
The homebuilding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. We compete with numerous other residential construction companies, including large national and regional firms, for customers, land, financing, raw materials, skilled labor, and employees. A number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us. We compete for customers primarily on the basis of home design and location, price, customer satisfaction, construction quality, reputation, and the availability of mortgage financing. We also compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing. In the past several years, we have embarked on a strategy to expand our product offerings to include more affordably-priced homes to reach a deeper pool of qualified buyers and in connection with growing our overall community count. We anticipate that we will continue to build more affordably-priced homes. We believe there is more competition among homebuilding companies in more affordable product offerings than in the luxury and move-up segments, however, we also believe this is a prudent strategy as there is a larger population of qualified buyers in more affordable price points. For risks associated with the competition we face, please see the risk factor under the heading "Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to compete effectively against competitors in the homebuilding industry".
    Surety Bonds and Other Obligations

 In connection with the development of our communities, we are frequently required to provide performance, maintenance and other bonds and letters of credit in support of our related obligations with respect to such developments. The amount of such obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with our pending development activities. In the event any such bonds or letters of credit are drawn upon, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of such surety bonds or letters of credit. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximatel y $47.6 million and $ 0 of outstanding performance bonds and letters of credit, respectively, primarily related to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments.  Estimated cost to complete for surety bonds as of December 31, 2019 was $29.1 million. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to numerous local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters, which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Communities that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or "slow-growth" or "no-growth" initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees and exactions for communities in their jurisdiction. Communities for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these communities or prevent their development.
 
  10 



We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site’s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. Legislation related to climate change and energy efficiency can impose stricter building standards, which may increase our cost to build. From time to time, the EPA and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. California, where we conduct most of our operations, is especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws.
 
Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. A mitigation system may be installed during the construction of a home if a cleanup does not remove all contaminants of concern or to address a naturally occurring condition such as methane. Some buyers may not want to purchase a home with a mitigation system.
 
We manage compliance with environmental laws at the division level with assistance and oversight from our corporate office. As part of the land acquisition due diligence process, we utilize environmental assessments to identify environmental conditions that may exist on potential acquisition properties. To date, environmental assessments or our compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, although it may do so in the future.
 
We use and our business relies upon general contractors' licenses and corporate real estate broker's licenses in order to build and sell homes.
 
For a further discussion of the impact of govern regulations on our business, including the impact of environmental regulations, please see the risk factors included under the heading "Risks Related to Laws and Regulations."
 
  Environmental Impact and Sustainability

Homebuilding impacts the environment in a variety of ways, including through the use of water, gas and electricity, transportation of building materials, and the increase in density by constructing homes in areas that were previously undeveloped. However, our new homes utilize innovative technologies and systems to vastly improve the energy and water efficiency of our homes compared to resale homes. For example, beginning with all building permits issued after January 1, 2020, all of our homes in California will be equipped with a solar electric system.  We believe that the standards for new home construction mitigate impacts to the environment by increasing home energy efficiency and reducing the impact of construction on the environment (such as limiting discharge of storm water and impacts to wetlands), all while addressing the serious need for housing in this country.
 
California is at the forefront when it comes to sustainability, including green energy, water conservation and efficient construction standards. As a builder with most of its operations in California, we have made a dedicated effort to implement a variety of sustainable best practices in many of our communities, including the masterplan communities which we and our joint venture partners have created. For example, our Cannery joint venture created a visionary farm-to-table new-home community, with a working urban farm operated by the Center for Land-Based Learning which serves as a training ground for beginning farmers while supplying the community with fresh seasonal produce. Non-potable water from an onsite agricultural well was designed to irrigate landscaped areas along roadways and within open-space greenbelts, parks and the urban farm. In addition, a 1.5 kV photovoltaic solar system and electric vehicle charging pre-wire was designed to come standard with every home, and residents could upgrade to net zero living. Similarly, our McKinley Village joint venture created the McKinley Village masterplan where each residence is pre-wired for solar and electric vehicle chargers. We believe our commitment to design and build energy-efficient homes is aligned with buyer sensitivities about how eco-friendly designs, features and materials help impact the environment and the livability of homes in addition to reducing cost of home ownership.
 
In January 2020, we launched "EVO Home Tech", our advanced home automation technology packages which provide our homebuyers with advanced connectivity and features such as smart light controls and thermostats to allow for more convenient control of energy consumption and increased sustainability.

Health and Safety Matters 
 We strive to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. We believe that corporate social responsibility is a significant factor for our overall success. This includes adopting ethical practices to direct how we do business while keeping the interests of our stakeholders and the environment in mind, including valuing and challenging the talented men and women who comprise our workforce. To that end, we have a comprehensive Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to all employees and an actively-managed ethics hotline. We are also committed to maintaining high standards in health and safety at all of our sites. We have a health and safety audit system that includes comprehensive independent third-party inspections.  Our Risk Management team has a training system and a safety enforcement system in place in the field, which have led to an increase in safety awareness and effectiveness. 
Employees and Social Governance
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 260 employees, 102 of whom were executive, management and administrative personnel located in our offices, 56 of whom were sales and marketing personnel and 102 were involved in field construction. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, certain of the third party subcontractors and trade partners engaged by us are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements. We believe that relations with our employees, subcontractors and trade partners are good.
 
The Company is committed to creating and maintaining a community in which its employees are free from all forms of harassment and discrimination. We require employee training and protocols for preventing, reporting and addressing behavior that is not in line with our business standards, our core values, including, but not limited to, discriminatory or harassing behavior and sexual misconduct.
 
To ensure a positive and productive workplace, we proactively seek feedback from employees and continuously engage in two-way communication with our team members.  We conduct an annual employee engagement survey soliciting direct feedback from our employees utilizing a third party survey and analytics provider. Our most recent survey, from December 2019, had approximately 99% participation and reflected that approximately 91.2% of our employees are positively engaged, which was up from 90.3% in the 2018 survey. This score is based on affirmative responses to factors such as being proud to work for New Home, a willingness to recommend New Home, and achieving a feeling of personal accomplishment associated with the employee's work. Annually, our CEO shares results in person with all team members at divisional all-employee meetings and each division’s leader is tasked with identifying improvement plans. The insights gained from our employee engagement surveys have helped us drive significant improvements in the way our employees work and engage with one another.
 
The Company engages in a variety of learning and development opportunities with its employees. Examples of such opportunities include construction best practices training, education for managers on delivering performance feedback, and sales coaching programs. Regionally, department leaders host "lunch and learns" on topics such as the land acquisition process, design and architecture, reading construction plans, and training on the department of real estate rules and regulations for our project management teams. In addition, we offer all employees access to an online on-demand micro-learning platform with hundreds of courses on topics that include technology, communication, business acumen, leadership and personal growth.
 
Further, we believe it is important to treat all employees with dignity and respect. Employee diversity and inclusion are embraced and opportunities for training, growth, and advancement are strongly encouraged.
