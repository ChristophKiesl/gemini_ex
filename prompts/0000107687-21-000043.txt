Principal Products
Our operations are organized into two reportable segments, Towable and Motorhome, based on similarities within their markets, products, operations and distributions.
Towable
A towable is a non-motorized vehicle that is designed to be towed by automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs, or vans and is used as temporary living quarters for recreational travel. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ("RVIA") classifies towables in four types: conventional travel trailers, fifth wheels, folding camper trailers, and truck campers. We manufacture and sell conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels under the Winnebago and Grand Design brand names, which are defined as follows:

Type | Description | Winnebago product offerings | Grand Design product offerings 
Travel trailer | Towed by means of a hitch attached to the frame of the vehicle | Minnie, Micro Minnie, Hike, and Voyage | Transcend, Imagine, and Reflection
Fifth wheel | Constructed with a raised forward section that is connected to the vehicle with a special fifth wheel hitch | Voyage | Momentum, Reflection, and Solitude

Our travel trailer and fifth wheel towables are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $30,000 to $137,000, depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges.

Motorhome
A motorhome is a self-propelled mobile dwelling used primarily as temporary living quarters during vacation and camping trips, or to support active and mobile lifestyles. The RVIA classifies motorhomes into four types, all of which we manufacture and sell under the Winnebago and Newmar brand names, which are defined as follows: 
Type | Description | Winnebago product offerings | Newmar product offerings 
Class A | Built on a heavy truck chassis in both diesel and gas models with the ability to tow a small vehicle | Gas: Adventurer, Vista, and Sunstar | Gas: Bay Star and Bay Star Sport 
Diesel: Forza, Journey, and Inspire | Diesel: Canyon Star, King Aire, Dutch Star, Essex, Kountry Star, London Aire, Mountain Aire, New Aire, and Ventana 
Class B | Built by adding a taller roof and amenities to an existing van, which allows for easy maneuvering | Gas: Travato, Solis, and Solis Pocket | N/A 
Diesel: Era, Boldt, and Revel 
Class C | Built on a medium truck chassis in both diesel and gas models with similar features and amenities to Class A models | Gas: Ekko, Spirit, and Minnie Winnie | Diesel: Super Star and Supreme Aire
Diesel: View and Navion 
Accessibility Enhanced | Class A vehicle with a wheelchair lift to allow individuals with physical disabilities access to the motorhome | Gas: Adventurer AE and Roam AE | N/A 
Diesel: Inspire AE 

Our Class A, B and C motorhomes are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $96,000 to $1,400,000, depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges. Our motorhomes range in length from 18 to 45 feet.
Motorhome parts and service activities represent revenues generated by service work we perform for retail customers at our Forest City, Iowa and Nappanee, Indiana facilities as well as revenues from the sale of unit parts. Our competitive strategy is to provide proprietary manufactured parts through our dealer network, which we believe increases customer satisfaction and the value of our motorhomes.
Marine
We manufacture and sell premium quality boats under our Chris-Craft and Barletta brands in the recreational powerboat industry through an established network of independent authorized dealers. Chris-Craft, based in Sarasota, Florida, has a number of product offerings under the Launch and Launch GT Series, Calypso Series and Catalina Series which are sold through our global dealer network. Barletta Boat Company, LLC and Three Limes, LLC (collectively, "Barletta"), based in Bristol, Indiana has product offerings under the L-Class, Corsa, and C-Class series. We acquired Barletta on August 31, 2021. Refer to Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail regarding the acquisition.
Winnebago Specialty Vehicles
We also manufacture other specialty commercial vehicles custom designed for the buyer's specific needs and requirements, such as law enforcement command centers, mobile medical clinics, and mobile office space. These specialty commercial vehicles are manufactured in Forest City, Iowa and sold through our dealer network. In addition, we also provide commercial vehicles as bare shells to third-party upfitters for conversion at their facilities. 
Production
We generally produce towables and motorhomes made to order for dealers. We have some ability to increase our capacity by scheduling overtime and/or hiring additional production employees or to decrease our capacity through the use of shortened work weeks and/or reducing head count. We have long been known as an industry leader in innovation as each year we introduce new or redesigned products. These changes generally include new floor plans, features, functionality, and sizes as well as design and decor modifications. Most of our raw materials such as steel, aluminum, fiberglass, and wood products are obtainable from numerous sources.
Our towables are produced at two assembly campuses located in Middlebury, Indiana. The majority of components are comprised of frames, appliances, and furniture, and are purchased from multiple suppliers.

Our motorhomes are produced in the states of Iowa and Indiana at five different campuses. Our motorhome business utilizes vertically integrated supply streams, with the principal exceptions being chassis, engines, generators, and appliances that we purchase from reputable manufacturers. Certain parts, especially motorhome chassis, are available from a small group of suppliers.
Backlog
We strive to balance timely order fulfillment to our dealers with the lead times suppliers require to efficiently source materials and manage costs. Production facility constraints at peak periods also lead to fluctuations in backlog orders which we manage closely. A more detailed description of our Motorhome and Towable order backlog is included in Item 7 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Distribution and Financing
We distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers throughout the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer. Foreign sales were 10% or less of net revenues during each of the past three fiscal years.

As of August 28, 2021, our RV and marine dealer network in the U.S. and Canada included 641 physical dealer locations, many of which carry more than one of our brands. None of our dealer organizations accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for Fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.
We have sales and service agreements with most dealers which are subject to annual review. Many of the dealers are also engaged in other areas of business, including the sale of automobiles, trailers, or boats, and most dealers carry one or more competitive lines of RVs. We continue to place high emphasis on the capability of our dealers to provide complete service for our products. Dealers are obligated to provide full service for owners of our products or, in lieu thereof, to secure such service from other authorized providers.
We advertise and promote our products through national trade magazines, product brochures, the Go RVing national advertising campaign sponsored by RVIA, our websites, social media, direct-mail advertising campaigns, various national promotional opportunities, and on a local basis through trade shows, television, radio, and newspapers, primarily in connection with area dealers.
Sales to dealers are made primarily on cash terms. Most dealers are financed on a "floorplan" basis under which a bank or finance company lends the dealer all, or substantially all, of the purchase price, collateralized by a security interest in the merchandise purchased. As is customary in the industries we serve, we typically enter into a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealer's purchase of our product upon the lending institution's request and after completion of a credit check of the dealer involved. Our repurchase agreements provide that, for up to 18 months after an RV unit is financed and up to 24 months after a marine unit is financed, in the event of default by the dealer on the agreement to pay the lending institution and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, we will repurchase the financed merchandise from the lender at the amount then due, which is often less than dealer invoice. Our maximum exposure for repurchases can vary significantly, depending upon the level of dealer inventory, general economic conditions, demand for our products, dealer location, and access to and the cost of financing. See Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
The RV and marine markets are highly competitive with many other manufacturers selling products which compete directly with our products. Some of our competitors are much larger than us, most notably in the towable RV market, which may provide these competitors additional purchasing power. The competition in our industries is based upon design, price, quality, features, and service of the products. We believe our principal competitive advantages are our brand strength, product differentiation, product quality, and our service after the sale. We also believe that our products have historically commanded a price premium as a result of these competitive advantages. 
Seasonality
The primary use of RVs and marine products for leisure travel and outdoor recreation has historically led to a peak retail selling season concentrated in the spring and summer months and lower sales during fall and winter months. Our sales are generally influenced by this pattern in retail sales, but sales can also be impacted by the level of dealer inventory. As a result, our RV sales are historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends in February.
Governmental Regulations
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and, to a limited extent, international laws and regulations, including the federal Motor Vehicle Act ("MVA"), under which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") may require manufacturers to recall RVs that contain safety-related defects, and numerous state consumer protection laws and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles, including so-called "Lemon Laws." The Boat Safety Act of 1971 has similar safety-related recall 

requirements for marine units. In addition, marine units sold in the U.S. and Europe must meet the certification standards of the U.S. Coast Guard and the European Community, respectively. 
We are also subject to regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). Our facilities are periodically inspected by federal and state agencies, such as OSHA. We are a member of RVIA, a voluntary association of RV manufacturers which promulgates RV safety standards. We place an RVIA seal on each of our RVs to certify that the RVIA standards have been met. We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with the applicable vehicle safety, consumer protection, RVIA, and OSHA regulations and standards.
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, generation, storage, treatment, emission, labeling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and noise pollution. We believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material aspects.

We have several domestic and foreign trademark registrations and pending applications associated with our products which include: Winnebago, 24 W 7 (logo), +Lounger, Adventurer, Affinity, Airlie, Aspect, Barletta, Barletta Cabrio, Barletta Lusso, Barletta Reserve, B (logo), Bay Star, Bay Star Sport, Benchmark, Brave, Boldt, Bound by the W, Cambria, Canyon Star, CC (logo), Chris Craft, Chris-Craft (logo), Comfort Drive, Comfort Drive Steering (logo), Commander, Corsair, Cottesloe, Country Coach, Destination, DoggieDockView, Dutch Star, Dynomax, Eco-Hot, Ekko, Ellipse, eMLU, Era, Essex, Forza, Fresco, Fuse, Glide & Dine, GoWinnebago, Grand Design, Grand Design Recreational Vehicles, Grand Design RV, Horizon, Imagine, InLounge, Inspire, Instinct, Intable, Intent, Intrigue, Itasca, Itasca (logo), Journey, King Aire, Kountry Aire (logo), Kountry Star, Lancer, Latitude, London Aire, Maxum Chassis, Maxum II, Micro Minnie, Minnie, Minnie Drop, Minnie Winnie, MLU, Momentum, Mountain Aire, Navion, New Aire, Newmar, Outlook, Paseo, Porto, Pure3 Energy Management System, Reflection, Rest Easy, Revel, Roamer, Scorpion, Silhouette, Sightseer, Slidetoon, SOLIS, Solitude, Spirit, Star Foundation, Star Foundation (logo), Suncruiser, Sunova, Sunstar, Supershell, Superstar, Supreme Aire, The Most Recognized Name in Motorhomes, Thermo-Panel, Transcend, Transcend Xplor, Travato, Trend, True Trax, Ventana, Ventana LE, Via, View, V.I.P.

We believe that our trademarks and trade names are significant assets to our business, and we have in the past and will in the future vigorously protect them against infringement by third parties. We are not dependent upon any patents or technology licenses of others for the conduct of our business.    
Human Capital Management
Employees are our greatest strength and we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, high-performance culture where our people thrive. We strive to recruit, develop, engage and protect our workforce. The following are key human capital measures and objectives that the Company currently focuses on:
Employee Well-being and Safety
We are committed to designing, operating, and maintaining safe and controlled working conditions, including a "zero-harm" culture for all employees. We have implemented actions to build an increasingly risk-informed perspective within our culture to reduce the risk of injuries and illness. All sites have established a baseline risk control score with the goal to achieve at least 95 percent sustainable level control within the next few years. Between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, we reduced the number of days away, restricted or transferred ("DART") due to a work-related injury or illness by 10% and remained stable on our total recordable incidence rate ("TRIR"). Our experience and continuing focus on workplace safety enabled us to preserve business continuity, and maintain our commitment to keeping our employees and visitors safe, during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the mental, emotional, and physical well-being of our employees as a key focus, we shared resources for employees to manage remote work and balance parental and other family responsibilities. 
Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
We accelerated our journey to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI") by living our core values and building a culture that embraces our employees background and diverse skills, thoughts, and perspectives. As of August 28, 2021, 23% of our workforce was female and 77% of our workforce was male. We created a new DEI strategic framework which included a revised DEI road map and objectives, revised Code of Conduct and human rights policy, a new Supplier Code of Conduct, expanded partnerships with nonprofit organizations led by and for communities of color and women, hired a new Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, and engaged in employee focus groups and inclusion surveys. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer represents us as one of 1300+ CEOs to sign the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion commitment.
We recognize the importance of having diverse perspectives on our Board of Directors and aspire to promote diversity as we build and refresh our Board of Directors. Our DEI framework includes Board of Directors and leadership development. As of August 28, 2021, women represented 27% of our Board of Directors.

We believe our company and our brands should reflect the diversity of outdoor enthusiasts. We also believe we thrive and are more successful when we empower, value, and respect our employees and our communities. We are committed to continuing to build a stronger, more inclusive culture and workplace.
Leadership and Culture Development
We believe our future success depends on our people, and attracting, engaging, retaining and developing diverse talent is a key priority. We strive to grow and develop all of our teams and bolster our talent pipeline. Our Code of Conduct and our human rights policy include shared values and guides relationships with our people and our stakeholders. To build and attract the next generation of leaders, we have built external partnerships to introduce high school and first-generation college students to potential career opportunities in the RV and marine industries. We also collaborate with regional workforce development partners to connect job seekers with on-the-job training and leadership development. 
Annually we have our team members respond to an engagement survey that evaluates our employee's thoughts about their experience working at our company. Responses are reviewed by team leaders and used to help build specific action plans to continually improve our employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We engage employees through community volunteerism and team-building, and we are always striving to improve our employee experience, develop and grow our teams, and create a culture of inclusion and belonging.
As of August 28, 2021, we employed approximately 6,532 persons, of which 21% and 79% were non-production and production workers, respectively. In addition, 14% and 86% were salaried and hourly employees, respectively. None of our employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good. The employee metrics disclosed herein do not include Barletta, as the business was acquired on August 31, 2021.
