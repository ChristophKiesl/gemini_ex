Overview
Mitek is a leading innovator of mobile identity verification solutions. We are a software development company with expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning. We are currently serving more than 5,900 financial services organizations and leading brands across the globe. Our solutions are embedded in native mobile apps and mobile optimized websites to facilitate better mobile user experiences and compliant transactions.
Our Mobile Deposit® solution is used today by millions of consumers in the U.S. and Canada for mobile check deposit. Following the success of Mobile Deposit®, Mitek introduced a multi-check capture solution that enables businesses to deposit multiple checks in one batch using a mobile device.
Mitek is also applying our artificial intelligence and machine learning science to digital identity verification globally. Mitek’s Mobile Verify™ is empowering the digital transformation of companies by enabling them to identify with whom they are conducting business. To be in compliance with many governmental Know Your Customer ("KYC") and Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") regulatory requirements around the globe identity verification is mandatory. In addition to regulated markets, digital identity verification is also becoming an imperative in the new trust-based sharing economy.
Our identity verification solutions are for use with digital/mobile onboarding, trust establishment, and to facilitate money movement. Today, the financial services verticals (banks, credit unions, lenders, payments processors, card issuers, insurers, etc.) represent the most usage of our solutions, but we are also seeing growing adoption by telecommunications, healthcare, travel, retail, sharing economy, and online marketplaces.
We market and sell our products and services worldwide through internal, direct sales teams located in the US and Europe as well as through channel partners. Our partner sales strategy includes channel partners who are financial services technology providers and identity verification providers. These partners integrate our products into their solutions to meet the needs of their customers.
Mitek is headquartered in San Diego, California, and has offices in Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Barcelona, Spain; and London, United Kingdom.
Product and Technology Overview
Technology
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we had one operating segment: the development, sale, and service of our proprietary software solutions related to mobile image capture and identity verification.
Our digital technology solutions are provided in two parts: (i) a software development kit ("SDK") for mobile auto capture and (ii) a software platform which utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to classify and extract data and authenticate documents including passports, identity cards, driver's licenses, and checks using a camera-equipped mobile device.
Our technology is built with patented algorithms that analyze images of documents in many ways. These include image quality analysis, image repair and optimization, document identification and classification, data extraction, and authenticators that verify whether an identity document is an unaltered government-issued document.
Products
Mobile Deposit®
Mitek invented Mobile Deposit® to allow individuals and businesses to remotely deposit checks using their camera-equipped smartphone or tablet.
Mobile Deposit® is utilized by the mobile banking apps of U.S. and Canadian retail banks. As of September 30, 2017, more than 5,900 financial institutions had signed agreements to deploy Mobile Deposit®. 
The Mobile Deposit® process allows consumers to take photographs of the front and back of a check and then remotely deposit the check with their participating bank by submitting the images electronically. Mitek delivers a simple and easy user experience with our proprietary mobile auto capture which assists users in capturing a usable image of a check by simply holding their mobile device over the check. We began selling Mobile Deposit® in the second fiscal quarter of 2008.

Mobile Verify™
Mobile Verify™ is an identity verification solution that can be integrated into mobile apps, mobile websites, and desktop applications. Mobile Verify combines our advanced auto capture experience and computer vision technology with our software platform which utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to perform algorithmic-based tests that verify the authenticity of thousands of identification document types globally, including passports, driver licenses, and identity cards. The key driver of digital identity verification is to meet stringent regulatory requirements mandated by governments and industry regulators for digital onboarding and money movement.
Mobile Fill™
Mobile Fill™, which includes our touch free auto capture experience, enables the camera to serve as a keyboard. Using Mobile Fill™, consumers can pre-fill forms with personal data by simply snapping a picture of their driver's license, passport, credit card, or other document.  Organizations can use Mobile Fill™ for a variety of purposes, including streamlining the process of opening a checking, savings, or credit card account, paying a bill, activating a “switch and save” offer, and more. Mobile Fill is available for native apps and mobile web applications. It is used by national and regional banks, credits unions, wireless telecom operators, and insurance providers.
Mobile Docs™
Mobile Docs™ is a mobile document scanning solution. It enables consumers to take photos of documents resulting in scanner-quality images. Mobile Docs™ is used to submit the trailing documents required for digital account opening, lending, and other use cases where supporting documentation is required in a workflow.
MiSnap Multi-Check Capture™
MiSnap Multi-Check Capture™ is an SDK that banks embed in their business banking app that facilitates capture of multiple checks in one deposit session. Built on our automatic capture technology, MiSnap Multi-Check Capture™ interfaces with an institution's item processing back-end system and leverages existing investments in Mobile Deposit® processing infrastructure.

Sales and Marketing
We derive revenue predominately from the sale of licenses (to both our on premise and software as a service ("SaaS") products) and transaction fees to use our Mobile Deposit®, MiSnap Multi-Check Capture™, Mobile Verify™, Mobile Fill™ and Mobile Docs™ products, and to a lesser extent by providing maintenance and professional services for the products we offer. The revenue we derive from the sale of such licenses is derived from both the sale to our channel partners of licenses to sell the applications we offer as well as the direct sale to customers of licenses.
We have an internal marketing group that develops corporate and digital marketing strategies. The internal team executes these strategies with the help of external resources as needed to support both direct sales and channel partners’ sales efforts.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we derived revenue of $10.4 million, or 23% of our total revenue, from one customer, compared to revenue of $6.3 million or 18% of our total revenue, from one customer in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we derived revenue of $6.3 million, or 25% of our total revenue from one customer.
International revenues accounted for 14%, 15%, and 5% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Revenues from our products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. 
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights primarily through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third party non-disclosure agreements, and other measures. We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product development, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the U.S. or abroad will be adequate. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection. Further, there can be no assurance that our patents will offer any protection or that they will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party, our operating results could be adversely affected.

As of September 30, 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued us 35 patents and we have filed for 16 additional domestic and international patents. We have 15 registered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks, as appropriate. We claim common law protection for, and may seek to register, other trademarks. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees.
Market Opportunities, Challenges and Risks
We believe that financial institutions and other companies see our patented solutions as a way to provide an enhanced digital customer experience and, at the same time, create trust with customers and meet regulatory requirements.  The value of digital transformation to our customers is an increase in top line revenue and a reduction in the cost of sales and service. We believe digital transformation initiatives are in their infancy. We predict growth in both our Mobile Deposit® and our Identity products based on current trends of bank branch closure, more stringent regulations, growing usage of online marketplaces, and ever-increasing demand for mobile sales, and service by millennials and mobile-first consumers.
Factors adversely affecting the pricing of, or demand for, our digital solutions, such as competition from other products or technologies, any decline in the demand for mobile applications, or negative publicity or obsolescence of the software environments in which our products operate, could result in lower revenues or gross margins. Further, because substantially all of our revenues are from a few types of technology, our product concentration may make us especially vulnerable to market demand and competition from other technologies, which could reduce our revenues.
The sales cycle for our software and services can be lengthy and the implementation cycles for our software and services by our channel partners and customers can also be lengthy, often a minimum of six months and sometimes longer for larger customers, and require significant investments. If implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers is delayed or otherwise not completed, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.
Revenues related to most of our on-premise licenses for mobile products are required to be recognized up front upon satisfaction of all applicable revenue recognition criteria. Revenue related to our SaaS products is recognized ratably over the life of the contract or as transactions are used depending on the contract criteria. The recognition of future revenues from these licenses is dependent upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the term of our license agreements, the timing of implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers, and the timing of any re-orders of additional licenses and/or license renewals by our channel partners and customers.
During each of the last few years, sales of licenses to one or more channel partners have comprised a significant part of our revenue each year. This is attributable to the timing of renewals or purchases of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any single channel partner. If we were to lose a channel partner relationship, we do not believe such a loss would adversely affect our operations because either we or another channel partner could sell our products to the end-users that had purchased products from the channel partner we lost. However, in that case, we or another channel partner must establish a relationship with the end-users, which could take time to develop, if it develops at all.
We have a growing number of competitors in the mobile capture and identity verification industry, many of which have greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources. However, we believe our patented mobile capture and identity verification technology, our growing portfolio of products and geographic coverage for the financial services industry, and our market expertise gives us a distinct competitive advantage. To remain competitive, we must continue to offer products that are attractive to the consumer as well as being secure, accurate, and convenient. To help us remain competitive, we intend to further strengthen our portfolio of products through research and development as well as partnering with other technology providers.
Competition
The market for our products and solutions is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We face direct and indirect competition from a broad range of competitors who offer a variety of products and solutions to our current and potential customers. Our principal competition comes from: (i) customer-developed solutions; (ii) companies offering alternative methods of identity verification; and (iii) companies offering competing technologies capable of mobile remote deposit capture or authenticating identity documents and facial photo comparison.
It is also possible that we will face competition from new industry participants or alternative technologies. Moreover, as the market for automated document processing, image recognition and authentication, check imaging, and fraud detection software develops, a number of companies with significantly greater resources than we have could attempt to enter or increase their presence in our industry, either independently or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors, or otherwise increase their focus on the industry. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our current and potential customers.

Our products are compliant with Service-Oriented Architecture standards and compete, to various degrees, with products produced by a number of substantial competitors. Competition among product providers in this market generally focuses on price, accuracy, reliability, and technical support. We believe our primary competitive advantages in this market are: (i) our mobile auto capture user experience used by millions of consumers; (ii) our patented science; (iii) scalability; and (iv) an architectural software design that allows our products to be more readily modified, improved with added functionality, and configured for new products, thereby allowing our software to be easily upgraded.
Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Research and Development
We develop software products internally and also purchase or license rights to third-party intellectual property. We believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to maintain and improve our core technologies, enhance our existing products, and develop new products that meet an expanding range of customer requirements.
Internal research and development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products and gives us the ability to determine which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented to ensure the proper functioning of our software products. We intend to expand our existing product offerings and introduce new mobile capture and digital identity verification capabilities that meet a broader set of needs of our customers. We intend to continue to support the major industry standard operating environments.
Our research and development organization includes software engineers and scientists, many of whom have advanced degrees, as well as additional personnel in quality assurance and related disciplines. All our scientists and software engineers are involved in product development.  
The development team includes specialists in artificial intelligence, computer vision, software engineering, user interface design, product documentation, and quality assurance. The team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the performance, quality, and utility of all of our products. In addition to research and development, our engineering staff provides customer technical support on an as-needed basis.
Our research and development expenses for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $10.4 million, $7.8 million, and $5.6 million, respectively. We expect research and development expenses during fiscal year 2018 to increase as compared with those incurred in fiscal year 2017 as we continue our new product research and development efforts.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of September 30, 2017, we had 141 employees, 101 in the U.S. and 40 in Europe (United Kingdom and The Netherlands), 139 of which are full time. Our total employee base consists of 65 sales and marketing and professional services employees, 50 research and development and support employees, and 26 employees in executive, finance, network administration, and other capacities. In addition, we engaged various consultants in the areas of research and development, product development, finance, and marketing during fiscal year 2017. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization. Substantially all of our employees, other than certain number of our executive officers and employees with customary employment arrangements within Europe, are at will employees, which means that each employee can terminate his or her relationship with us and we can terminate our relationship with him or her at any time. We offer industry competitive wages and benefits and are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
