Item 1.    Business
Biovail Corporation (“Biovail”) was formed under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on February 18, 2000, as a result of the amalgamation of TXM Corporation and Biovail Corporation International. Biovail was continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the “CBCA”) effective June 29, 2005. In connection with the acquisition of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (“Valeant”) in September 2010, Biovail was renamed “Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.” 
Effective August 9, 2013, we continued from the federal jurisdiction of Canada to the Province of British Columbia, meaning that we became a company registered under the laws of the Province of British Columbia as if we had been incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. As a result of this continuance, our legal domicile became the Province of British Columbia, the Canada Business Corporations Act ceased to apply to us and we became subject to the British Columbia Business Corporations Act. 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”), we are referring to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
Introduction
We are a multinational, specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company that develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of branded, generic and branded generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (“OTC”) products, and medical devices (contact lenses, intraocular lenses, ophthalmic surgical equipment, and aesthetics devices), which are marketed directly or indirectly in over 100 countries. We are diverse not only in our sources of revenue from our broad drug and medical device portfolio, but also among the therapeutic classes and geographies we serve.
The Company's portfolio of products falls into three reportable segments: (i) Bausch + Lomb/International, (ii) Branded Rx and (iii) U.S. Diversified Products. 

• | The Bausch + Lomb/International segment consists of sales of (i) pharmaceutical products, OTC products and medical device products in the area of eye health, primarily comprised of Bausch + Lomb products, with a focus on four product offerings (Vision Care, Surgical, Consumer and Ophthalmology Rx) sold in the U.S. and (ii) branded pharmaceutical products, branded generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products, medical device products, and Bausch + Lomb products sold in Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.


• | The Branded Rx segment consists of sales of pharmaceutical products related to (i) the Salix product portfolio in the U.S., (ii) the Dermatological product portfolio in the U.S., (iii) branded pharmaceutical products, branded generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products, medical device products, and Bausch + Lomb products sold in Canada and (iv) the oncology, dentistry and women’s health product portfolios in the U.S.


• | The U.S. Diversified Products segment consists of sales (i) in the U.S. of pharmaceutical products, OTC products and medical device products in the areas of neurology and certain other therapeutic classes, including aesthetics (which includes the Solta and Obagi businesses) and (ii) generic products in the U.S.

See Note 22, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on these reportable segments.
In January 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the outstanding equity interests in our subsidiary, Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Dendreon"), which holds the worldwide rights to Provenge®, an autologous cellular immunotherapy (vaccine) for prostate cancer treatment approved by the FDA in April 2010, for a purchase price of $820 million in cash. Our revenues from Provenge® were $303 million, $250 million and $0 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. With this sale, we are exiting the urological oncology business, which we do not believe to be core to our success and which will allow us to better align our product portfolio with our new operating model. Also in January 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our CeraVe®, AcneFree™ and AMBI® skincare brands, which have annualized revenue of less than $200 million, for a purchase price of $1,300 million in cash. The completion of each of these sale transactions is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.

Business Strategy 
We believe that there is significant opportunity in the eye health and branded prescription pharmaceutical segments. Our existing portfolio, commercial footprint and pipeline of product development projects position us to compete and be successful in these markets. As a result, we believe these businesses provide us with the greatest opportunity to build value for our stakeholders. In order to focus our efforts, in 2016, we performed a review of our portfolio of assets to identify those areas where we believe we have, and can maintain, a competitive advantage. We identify these areas as “core”, as we believe these assets generally have a greater value to our company than to other owners, as we believe we are best positioned to grow and develop them. By narrowing our focus, we have the opportunity to reduce complexity in our business and maximize the value of our core segments. We describe our core areas by business and by geography. Within our Branded Rx segment, our core businesses include gastrointestinal ("GI") and dermatology. We also view our global eye health business, within our Bausch + Lomb/International segment, as core. Although the business units that fall outside our definition of “core” assets may be solid, the focus of their product pipelines and geographic footprint are not fully aligned with the focus of our core business, and they are, therefore, at a disadvantage when competing against our core activities for resources and capital within the Company. 
Another critical element of our strategy is our lower risk, output-focused research and development model. This model allows us to advance certain development programs to drive future commercial growth, while minimizing our research and development expense. This is achieved primarily by: 

• | focusing on innovation through our internal research and development, selected acquisitions, and in-licensing;


• | focusing on productivity through measures such as leveraging industry overcapacity and outsourcing commodity services;


• | focusing on critical skills and capabilities needed to bring new technologies to the market;


• | pursuing life-cycle management programs for currently marketed products to increase such products’ value during their commercial lives; and


• | acquiring dossiers and registrations for branded generic products in emerging markets, which require limited manufacturing start-up and development activities.

Our long-term strategy has also historically included deploying cash via business development, debt repayment and repurchases, and share buybacks. Following the Company’s (then named Biovail Corporation) acquisition of Valeant on September 28, 2010, we completed numerous transactions to expand our portfolio offering and geographic footprint, including, among others, the acquisitions of Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (“Salix”) (the "Salix Acquisition") and Bausch & Lomb Holdings Incorporated (“B&L”) (the "B&L Acquisition"). Although these transactions were successful in generating growth and bolstering our product portfolio, in 2016, the Company transitioned away from a focus on acquisitions, and took steps to stabilize its business and began placing greater emphasis on a select number of internal research and development (“R&D”) projects. While we anticipate business development through acquisitions may be a component of our long-term strategy, we expect acquisitions to be much lower for the foreseeable future as compared to prior periods, as we focus on reducing our outstanding debt levels. Further, our Third Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, as amended (the "Credit Agreement") restricts us from, among other things, making acquisitions over an aggregate threshold (subject to certain exceptions) and from incurring debt to finance such acquisitions, until we achieve a specified leverage ratio. See Note 11, "LONG-TERM DEBT" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to our Credit Agreement.
We believe our increased focus on the development of new products will allow us to maximize our short term growth and profitability and allow us to stabilize the Company while bolstering our future growth. 
Segment Information
Our revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $9,674 million, $10,447 million and $8,206 million, respectively. We have approximately 1,800 products in our portfolio of products, which fall into three reportable segments: (i) Bausch + Lomb/International, (ii) Branded Rx and (iii) U.S. Diversified Products. Comparative segment information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 is presented in Note 22, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Revenues 
We generate alliance revenue and service revenue from the licensing of products and from contract services mainly in the areas of dermatology and topical medication. Contract service revenue is derived primarily from contract manufacturing for third parties. 
Research and Development
Our R&D organization focuses on the development of products through clinical trials. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $421 million, $334 million and $246 million, respectively, excluding impairment charges. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 1,100 employees were involved in our R&D efforts. 
For more information regarding our products in clinical development, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Key Initiatives — Internal Capital Allocation and Operating Efficiencies” of this Form 10-K.
Trademarks, Patents and Proprietary Rights
We rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality policies and procedures and patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrecy laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property and proprietary rights, as appropriate. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Trademarks
We believe that trademark protection is an important part of establishing product and brand recognition. We own or license a number of registered trademarks and trademark applications in the U.S., Canada and in various other countries throughout the world. U.S. federal registrations for trademarks remain in force for 10 years and may be renewed every 10 years after issuance, provided the mark is still being used in commerce. Trademark registrations in Canada remain in force for 15 years and may be renewed every 15 years after issuance, provided that, as in the case of U.S. federal trademark registrations, the mark is still being used in commerce. Other countries generally have similar but varying terms and renewal policies with respect to trademarks registered in those countries.
Data and Patent Exclusivity
For certain of our products, we rely on a combination of regulatory and patent rights to protect the value of our investment in the development of these products.
A patent is the grant of a property right which allows its holder to exclude others from, among other things, selling the subject invention in, or importing such invention into, the jurisdiction that granted the patent. In the U.S., Canada and the European Union (“EU”), generally patents expire 20 years from the date of application. We have obtained, acquired or in-licensed a number of patents and patent applications covering key aspects of certain of our principal products. In the aggregate, our patents are of material importance to our business taken as a whole. However, we do not consider any single patent material to our business as a whole. 
In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act provides non-patent regulatory exclusivity for five years from the date of the first FDA approval of a new drug compound in a New Drug Application (“NDA”). The FDA, with one exception, is prohibited during those five years from accepting for filing a generic, or ANDA, that references the NDA. In reference to the foregoing exception, if a patent is indexed in the FDA Orange Book for the new drug compound, a generic may file an ANDA four years from the NDA approval date if it also files a Paragraph IV Certification with the FDA challenging the patent. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of another full NDA. However, the NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to independently demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
5

A similar data exclusivity scheme exists in the EU, whereby only the pioneer drug company can use data obtained at the pioneer’s expense for up to eight years from the date of the first approval of a drug by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and no generic drug can be marketed for ten years from the approval of the innovator product. Under both the U.S. and the EU data exclusivity programs, products without patent protection can be marketed by others so long as they repeat the clinical trials necessary to show safety and efficacy. Canada employs a similar data exclusivity regulatory regime for innovative drugs.
In the U.S., the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act ("BPCIA") allows companies to seek FDA approval to manufacture and sell biosimilar or interchangeable versions of brand name biological products. Due to the size and complexity of biological products, as compared to small molecule drugs, a biosimilar must be “highly similar” to the reference product with “no clinically meaningful differences” in safety, purity and potency between the two. The BPCIA provides reference product sponsors with 12 years (potential for 6 additional months of pediatric exclusivity) of market exclusivity, but unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act which covers small molecules, it does not require reference product sponsors to list patents in an Orange Book equivalent and does not include an automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval upon the timely filing of a lawsuit. The BPCIA, however, does provide pre-litigation procedures for the parties to follow, including identification of relevant patents and each party’s basis for infringement and invalidity.  A biosimilar patent application cannot be filed until four years after the reference product is first licensed and a biosimilar cannot be launched, at the earliest (assumes no patent litigation or an adverse decision on all patents), until the expiration of the twelve years of data exclusivity from the approval of the product.  
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or a disease whose incidence rates number more than 200,000 where the sponsor establishes that it does not realistically anticipate that its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs. The sponsor that obtains the first marketing approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease is eligible to receive marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the orphan indication for a period of seven years.
Proprietary Know-How
We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technological innovation in the development and manufacture of many of our principal products. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.
Government Regulations
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, in Canada, in the EU and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, advertising and promotion, storage, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. As such, our products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation both before and after approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions or criminal prosecution.
Prior to human use, FDA approval (drugs (in the form of an NDA or ANDA for generic equivalents), biologics (in the form of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”)) and some medical devices) or marketing clearance (other devices) must be obtained in the U.S., approval by Health Canada must be obtained in Canada, EMA approval (drugs) or a CE Marking (devices) must be obtained for countries that are part of the EU and approval must be obtained from comparable agencies in other countries prior to manufacturing or marketing new pharmaceutical products or medical devices. Generally, preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must first be conducted and the results submitted to the applicable regulatory agency (such as the FDA) for approval. 
 Regulation by other federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and state and local authorities in the U.S., and by comparable agencies in certain foreign countries, is also required. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the FDA and state and local authorities regulate the advertising of medical devices, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products. The FDA requires a Boxed Warning (sometimes referred to as a “Black Box” Warning) for products that have shown a significant risk of severe or life-threatening adverse events and similar warnings are also required to be displayed on the product in certain other jurisdictions.
Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products and medical devices are required to comply with manufacturing regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and quality system management requirements, enforced by the FDA and Health 
6

Canada, in the U.S. and Canada respectively, and similar regulations enforced by regulatory agencies in other countries and we may face ongoing audits of our facilities and plants and those of our contract manufacturers by the FDA and such other regulatory agencies. In addition, we are subject to price control restrictions on our pharmaceutical products in many countries in which we operate.
We are also subject to extensive U.S. federal and state health care marketing and fraud and abuse regulations, such as the federal False Claims Act, federal and provincial marketing regulation in Canada and similar regulations in foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. The federal False Claims Act imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities who submit (or cause the submission of) false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal or state healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Some state anti-kickback laws also prohibit such conduct where commercial insurance, rather than federal or state, programs are involved. Due to recent legislative changes, violations of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. In addition, in the U.S. and Canada, companies may not promote drugs or medical devices for “off-label” uses - that is, uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those that were approved or cleared by the FDA or Health Canada, respectively - and “off-label promotion” in the U.S. has also formed the predicate for False Claims Act liability resulting in significant financial settlements. These and other laws and regulations, rules and policies may significantly impact the manner in which we are permitted to market our products. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
We may also be subject to various privacy and security regulations, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (collectively, "HIPAA"). HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common health care transactions (e.g., health care claims information and plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrollment, coordination of benefits and related information), as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. These standards require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. Complying with these laws involves costs to our business, and failure to comply with these laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Successful commercialization of our products may depend, in part, on the availability of governmental and third party payor reimbursement for the cost of our products. Third party payors may include government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. In the U.S., the E.U. and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, which has resulted in lower average realized prices. In the U.S., these pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. In particular, sales of our products may be subject to discounts from list price and rebate obligations, as well as formulary coverage decisions impacting or limiting the types of patients for whom coverage will be provided. Various U.S. healthcare and other laws regulate our interactions with government agencies, private insurance companies and other third party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for our products. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. In countries outside the U.S., the success of our products may depend, at least in part, on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because, in many countries, patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with certain governmental authorities for newly developed products can delay commercialization. In Canada and many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes, tenders and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase.
See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with these regulations and related matters.
Environmental and Other Regulation 
Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in both the U.S. and countries outside the U.S. (including Canada), including those governing the discharges of substances into the air, water and land, the handling treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater 
7

and solid waste, the cleanup of contaminated properties and other environmental matters. Certain of our development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous substances. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We cannot assure, however, that environmental liabilities relating to us or facilities owned, leased or operated by us will not develop in the future, and we cannot predict whether any such liabilities, if they were to develop, would require significant expenditures on our part. In addition, we are unable to predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Marketing and Customers 
Our top four geographic markets by country, based on 2016 revenue, are: the U.S. and Puerto Rico, Canada, China and Japan, which represent 65%, 3%, 3% and 2% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
The following table identifies external customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: 

 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
McKesson Corporation | 21% | 20% | 17% 
Cardinal Health, Inc. | 15% | 12% | 9% 
AmerisourceBergen Corporation | 13% | 14% | 10% 

No other customer generated over 10% of our total revenues.
We currently promote our pharmaceutical products to physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and wholesalers through our own sales force and sell through wholesalers. In some limited markets, we additionally sell directly to physicians, hospitals and large drug store chains and we sell through distributors in countries where we do not have our own sales staff. As part of our marketing program for pharmaceuticals, we use direct to customer advertising, direct mailings, advertise in trade and medical periodicals, exhibit products at medical conventions and sponsor medical education symposia.
Competition
Competitive Landscape for Products and Products in Development
The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly competitive. Our competitors include specialty and other large pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, biotechnology companies, OTC companies and generic manufacturers, in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America and in other countries in which we market our products. The dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of mid-size and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC and cosmeceutical sectors. With respect to the GI market, generic entrants continue to capture significant share for treatment of many GI conditions. In the area of irritable bowel syndrome ("IBS") and opioid induced constipation ("OIC"), competitors have recently launched new competing products, which should increase the size of these markets and intensify competition. The market for eye health products is very competitive, both across product categories and geographies. In addition to larger diversified pharmaceutical and medical device companies, we face competition in the eye health market from mid-size and smaller, regional and entrepreneurial companies with fewer products in niche areas or regions. 
Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology, GI, eye health and other therapeutic areas. Academic and other research and development institutions may also develop products or technologies that compete with our products, which technologies and products may be acquired or licensed by our competitors. These competitors may have greater financial, R&D or marketing resources than we do. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors.
We sell a broad range of products, and competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which the products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts.

Generic Competition 
We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products when patents covering certain of our currently marketed products expire or are successfully challenged or when the regulatory exclusivity for our products expires or is otherwise lost. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.
A number of our products already face generic competition. In the U.S. these products include among others, Ammonul®, Atralin®, Carac®, Edecrin®, Glumetza®, Nitropress®, certain strengths of Retin-A Micro®, Targetin® capsules, Tasmar®, Vanos®, Virazole®, Wellbutrin XL®, Xenazine®, Zegerid®, Ziana® and Zovirax® ointment. In Canada these products include among others, Aldara®, Glumetza®, Sublinox® and Wellbutrin XL®. In addition, certain of our products face the expiration of their patent or regulatory exclusivity in 2017 or in later years, following which we anticipate generic competition of these products. In addition, in certain cases, as a result of negotiated settlements of some of our patent infringement proceedings against generic competitors, we have granted licenses to such generic companies, which will permit them to enter the market with their generic products prior to the expiration of our applicable patent or regulatory exclusivity. Finally, for certain of our products that lost patent or regulatory exclusivity in prior years, we anticipate that generic competitors may launch in 2017 or in later years. Following a loss of exclusivity of and/or generic competition for a product, we would anticipate that product sales from such product would decrease significantly shortly following such loss of exclusivity or the entry of a generic competitor. Where we have the rights, we may elect to launch an authorized generic of such product (either ourselves or through a third party) prior to, upon or following generic entry, which may mitigate the anticipated decrease in product sales; however, even with launch of an authorized generic, the decline in product sales of such product would still be expected to be significant. 
Based on patent expiration dates, settlement agreements and/or competitive information, we believe that our products facing a potential loss of exclusivity and/or generic competition in the five year period from 2017 to and including 2021 include, among others, the following key products in the U.S.: in 2017, Deflux®, Istalol®, Isuprel®, Lotemax® Gel, Lotemax® Suspension, Mephyton®, Solesta®, and Syprine®, which in aggregate represented 7% of our U.S. and Puerto Rico revenues for 2016; in 2018, Acanya®, Cuprimine®, Elidel®, Migranal®, Moviprep® and certain strengths of Solodyn®, which in aggregate represented 6% of our U.S. and Puerto Rico revenues for 2016; in 2019, certain strengths of Solodyn® and Zyclara®, which in aggregate represented 2% of our U.S. and Puerto Rico revenues for 2016; in 2020, Clindagel® which represented 1% of our U.S. and Puerto Rico revenues for 2016; and, in 2021, Bepreve® and Preservision®, which represented 3% of our U.S. and Puerto Rico revenues for 2016. These dates may change based on, among other things, successful challenge to our patents, settlement of existing or future patent litigation and at-risk generic launches. 
In addition, for a number of our products (including Apriso®, Carac®, Cardizem®, Moviprep®, Onexton®, Uceris®, Relistor®, Solodyn® and Xifaxan® in the U.S. and Wellbutrin® XL in Canada), we have commenced infringement proceedings against potential generic competitors in the U.S. and Canada. If we are not successful in these proceedings, we may face increased generic competition for these products. See Note 20, "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding certain infringement proceedings.
See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on our competition risks.
Manufacturing 
We currently operate approximately 45 manufacturing plants worldwide. All of our manufacturing facilities that require certification from the FDA, Health Canada or foreign agencies have obtained such approval.
We also subcontract the manufacturing of certain of our products, including products manufactured under the rights acquired from other pharmaceutical companies. Generally, where the selling company is manufacturing the acquired products, acquired products continue to be produced for a specific period of time by the selling company. During that time, we integrate the products into our own manufacturing facilities or initiate manufacturing agreements with third parties. Where the acquired products are manufactured by contract manufacturers, we generally assume those arrangements from the selling company.
Products representing approximately half of our product sales for 2016 are produced by third party manufacturers under manufacturing arrangements.
In some cases, the principal raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredient, used by us (or our third party manufacturers) for our various products are purchased in the open market or are otherwise available from several sources. However, 
9

some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and other raw materials used in our products and some of the finished products themselves are currently only available from a single source; or others may in the future become available from only one source. For example, with respect to some of our largest products, the supply for each of our Xifaxan®, SofLens®, Wellbutrin XL®, Occuvite®, Preservision®, Renu®, Isuprel®, Xenazine®, Uceris® tablet and PureVision® finished products is only available from a single source and the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient for each of our Provenge®, Isuprel®, Xenazine® and Uceris® tablet products is also only available from a single source. In addition, in some cases, only a single source of such active pharmaceutical ingredient is identified in filings with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, and cannot be changed without prior regulatory approval. Any disruption in the supply of any such single-sourced active pharmaceutical ingredient, other raw material or finished product or an increase in the cost of such materials or products could adversely impact our ability to manufacture or sell such products, the ability of our third party manufacturers to supply us with such products, or our profitability. We attempt to manage the risks associated with reliance on single sources of active pharmaceutical ingredient, other raw materials or finished products by carrying additional inventories or, where possible, developing second sources of supply. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with our manufacturing arrangements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 21,500 employees. These employees included approximately 10,200 in production, 8,100 in sales and marketing, 2,100 in general and administrative positions and 1,100 in R&D. Collective bargaining exists for some employees in a number of countries in which we do business. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.
Product Liability Insurance
Since March 31, 2014, we have self-insured substantially all of our product liability risk for claims arising after that date. In the future, we will continue to re-evaluate our decision to self-insure and may purchase additional product liability insurance to cover product liability risk. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Seasonality of Business
Historically, revenues from our business tend to be weighted toward the second half of the year. Sales in the first quarter tend to be lower as patient co-pays and deductibles reset at the beginning of each year.  Sales in the fourth quarter tend to be higher based on consumer and customer purchasing patterns associated with healthcare reimbursement programs. However, there are no assurances that these historical trends will continue in the future.
Geographic Areas
A significant portion of our revenues is generated from operations or otherwise earned outside the U.S. and Canada. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, political and economic instability and restrictive governmental actions including possible nationalization or expropriation. Changes in the relative values of currencies may materially affect our results of operations. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
See Note 22, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area.
In 2016, a material portion of our revenue and income was earned in Ireland and Luxembourg, which have low tax rates. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K relating to tax rates.
