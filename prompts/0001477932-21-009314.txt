ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business

All for One Media Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Utah on March 2, 2004. The Company is a media and entertainment company focused on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups commonly referred to as “boy bands” and “girl groups.” The Company’s former operations were in the business of acquiring, training, and reselling horses with an emphasis in the purchase of thoroughbred weanlings or yearlings that were resold as juveniles.

On October 26, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Exchange Agreement (the “Asset Exchange”) with Crazy For The Boys, LLC (“CFTB”), a privately held company, and certain members owning membership interest in CFTB whereby the Company acquired certain assets from CFTB in exchange for 5,201,500 shares of the Company’s common stock. The assets that were acquired included a movie screenplay, master recordings, trademarks, and web domain names (the “CFTB Assets”).

On December 7, 2016, the Company organized a subsidiary in the state of Nevada, Crazy for the Boys Movie, LLC (“CFTB Movie”) which was created for the sole purpose of financing, producing and commercially exploiting (via all distribution sources and other means of revenue generation) one feature-length motion picture as a coming of age, musical dramedy, entitled “Crazy For The Boys” and all of its allied, ancillary, subsidiary and merchandising rights. The Company is the Managing Member of CFTB Movie and will have the sole and exclusive right to operate CFTB Movie.

In May 2017, the Company entered into an Assignment and Transfer Agreement with Crazy for the Boys GA LLC (“CFTB GA”), a company organized in the state of Georgia, whereby CFTB GA assigned and transferred all ownership, asset rights and other interest in CFTB GA to CFTB Movie. CFTB GA was created for the sole purpose of producing the one feature-length motion picture entitled “Crazy For The Boys” in the State of Georgia, in the city of Savannah, which offers production incentives up to 30% of Georgia production expenditures in transferable tax credits. The Georgia tax incentive program is available for qualifying projects, including feature films, television series, commercials, music videos, animation and game development. Consequently, CFTB GA became a wholly owned subsidiary of CFTB Movie and as of December 31, 2018, the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CFTB GA. Filming for the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018.

All For One Media Corp. is in the business of targeting the lucrative tween demographic across a multitude of entertainment platforms. The Company’s primary business objective is to embark on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups, commonly referred to as “boy bands” and “girl groups,” by utilizing both traditional and social media models. All For One Media owns over fifty completed professionally produced master recordings, as well as a full-length motion picture tentatively entitled Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of “Crazy For the Boys”) (the “Film”) that is ready for release. This musical comedy’s backstory creates a fictional girl group by the name of “Drama Drama”, and the Company intends to launch a new girl group with the same name simultaneous to the release of the Film.

The Company expects to generate revenues from movie receipts, sales, downloads and streaming of original recorded music, videos, motion pictures, music publishing, live performances, licensed merchandise and corporate sponsorships.

On January 17, 2020, our parent entity, entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with, our subsidiary, Carmel Valley Productions Inc. whereby the Company sold 90% of its 100% interest in CVPI and any of the Company’s right to receive revenues or repayment from the $100,000 advance on film rights under the terms of the Co-Production and Finance Agreement dated on July 24, 2019, for a total purchase price of $50,000.

On February 16, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Quiver Distribution RB USA, Inc (“Quiver”) to distribute (“Distribution Agreement”) our full-length PG13-rated feature film, Drama Drama, (formerly with a working title of “Crazy For the Boys”). Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, rights for all forms of VOD (including but not limited to transactional, subscription and advertising), EST, television, non-theatrical were given to Quiver and all other rights were reserved to the Company including ad-free youtube rights. In addition, after Quiver has deducted its distribution fee and recouped 100% of its actual, direct, arms-length expenses (“distribution expenses”), 100% of the backed participation shall go to the Company. Further, Quiver shall earn a distribution fee of 20%, increasing to 30% once Quiver has returned $400,000 to the Company. As of September 30, 2021, Quiver had not yet recouped their distribution expenses and we have not realized any revenue. 

The film, Drama Drama, was released on June 1, 2021, available across all major platforms, including iTunes, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Vudu, Fandango Now, Comcast, Cox, Spectrum, DirectTV, and Dish, among others. 

This first window in the release process was SVOD (Streaming) as discussed above and the second window in the release process will be by International Sales, Cable and Broadcast TV. In addition, the Drama Drama Official Soundtrack has been released through all major music streaming platforms on May 18, 2021, including Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.

As previously discussed, Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of “Crazy For the Boys”), the motion picture, has tested well with our target tween and teen demographic in its own right, but has also been designed to serve as a 100-minute launch vehicle for Drama Drama, the girl group.

Our goal is to generate revenues related to the Drama Drama franchise from the movie, music, merchandising, live concert performances, and additional sources.
