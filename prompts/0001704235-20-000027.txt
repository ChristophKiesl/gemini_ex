Overview 
Quintana Energy Services Inc. (either individually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context requires, the “Company,” “QES,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on April 13, 2017. Our accounting predecessor, Quintana Energy Services LP (“QES LP” and “Predecessor”), was formed as a Delaware partnership on November 3, 2014. In connection with our initial public offering (the “IPO”) which closed on February 13, 2018, the existing investors in QES LP and QES Holdco LLC contributed all of their direct and indirect equity interests to QES in exchange for shares of common stock in QES, and we became the holding company for the reorganized QES LP and its subsidiaries. 
We are a growth-oriented provider of diversified oilfield services to leading onshore oil and natural gas E&P companies operating in conventional and unconventional plays in all of the active major basins throughout the United States. We classify the services we provide into four reportable segments: (1) Directional Drilling, (2) Pressure Pumping, (3) Pressure Control and (4) Wireline.
Our Directional Drilling segment enables efficient drilling and guidance of the horizontal section of a wellbore using our technologically-advanced fleet of downhole motors and 115 MWD kits. Our pressure pumping services include hydraulic fracturing, cementing and acidizing services, and such services are supported by a high-quality pressure pumping fleet of approximately 253,150 HHP as of December 31, 2019. Our primary pressure pumping focus is on large hydraulic fracturing jobs. Our pressure control services include various forms of well control, completions and workover applications through our 24 coiled tubing units (10 of which are Large Diameter units), 36 rig-assisted snubbing units and ancillary equipment. As of December 31, 2019, our wireline services included 33 wireline units providing a full range of pump-down services in support of unconventional completions, and cased-hole wireline services enabling reservoir characterization. 
Our operations are diversified by our broad customer base and expansive geographical reach. We currently operate throughout all active major onshore oil and gas basins in the United States and we served approximately 1,100 customers in the year ended December 31, 2019. We have cultivated and maintain strong relationships with our E&P company customers, including leading companies such as EOG Resources, XTO Energy, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Parsley Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Matador Resources, and ConocoPhillips.
Our core businesses depend on our customers’ willingness to make expenditures to explore for, produce and develop oil and natural gas in the United States. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political stability in oil producing countries, merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers and changes in oil and natural gas prices. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the corresponding impact on E&P activity could adversely impact the level of drilling, completion and workover activity by some of our customers. This volatility affects the demand for and the price of our services. 
We derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting oil and natural gas operations. As oil and natural gas prices fluctuate significantly, demand for our services correspondingly changes as our customers must balance expenditures for drilling and completion services against their available cash flow. 
Shortly following the drop in WTI prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Baker Hughes Incorporated (“Baker Hughes”) lower 48 U.S. states land rig count fell by 7.1% during the first quarter of 2019. For the year ended 2019 rig count dropped a total of 277 rigs from 1052 rigs to 775 rigs, or a 26.3% decrease, compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2018. As of March 2, 2020, WTI closed at $46.75 per Bbl and the lower 48 U.S. land rig count decreased, 17 rigs, or 2.2%, to 758 rigs since December 31, 2019 further extending a trend of declining rig count from a high point of 1052 rigs in early 2019.
Crude oil prices increased 13.0% sequentially during the fourth quarter of 2019. WTI increased $15.99, or 35.4%, to $61.14 per Bbl on December 31, 2019, compared to the closing price on December 28, 2018 of $45.15 per Bbl. The rise in crude oil prices had a moderately positive impact on our fourth quarter 2019 consolidated results of operations, particularly those tied to activity in the U.S. shale play regions. Prices have continued to be volatile during the first quarter of 2020, ranging from $63.27 per Bbl to $44.76 per Bbl. If the current pricing environment for crude oil does not continue to improve, or returns to the pricing trends seen during the end of 2018, our customers may be required to further reduce their capital expenditures, causing additional declines in the demand for, and prices of, our products and services, which would adversely affect our future results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
The volatility in crude oil prices during 2019 had an overall negative impact on our consolidated results of operations for 2019. We experienced decreases in demand for our pressure pumping and wireline services in particular. Due to the decrease in pressure pumping demand, we deactivated three of our pressure pumping hydraulic fracturing fleets during 2019, one in January 2019, one in March 2019 and another fleet in October 2019. As of March 1, 2020, we have redeployed the second fleet in response to customer demand.
These decreases in demand in pressure pumping and wireline services were partially offset by increases in demand for our directional drilling services compared to the same period last year. From the fourth quarter of 2018 through the fourth quarter of 2019, our 
4

Directional Drilling business segment increased the monthly average number of days we provided services to rigs and earned revenues during the period, including days that standby revenues were earned (“rig days”) by 6.2%, while improving our day rates by 16.0% compared to the comparable period in 2018.
We have worked to optimize our cost structure and increase efficiency to better serve our customers. As part of these cost control initiatives, we closed unprofitable locations serving non-key regions, renegotiated supplier contracts and certain equipment leases to improve profitability and reduced general and administrative expenses. Given the decrease in customer activity, we moved quickly in the fourth quarter of 2019 to streamline our internal processes and initiate cost reductions, including personnel reductions in an effort to adjust our cost structure to improve our financial performance going forward and improve operational efficiencies and customer focus. 
Our Services 
We classify the services we provide into four reportable segments: (1) Directional Drilling, (2) Pressure Pumping, (3) Pressure Control and (4) Wireline. We describe each of these segments below. 
Directional Drilling
Our Directional Drilling segment is comprised of directional drilling services, downhole navigational and rental tools businesses and support services, including well planning and site supervision, which assists customers in the drilling and placement of complex directional and horizontal wellbores. This segment utilizes its fleet of in-house positive pulse measurement-while-drilling navigational tools, mud motors and ancillary downhole tools, as well as electromagnetic navigational systems. The demand for these services tends to be influenced primarily by customer drilling-related activity levels. We provide directional drilling and associated services to E&P companies in many of the most active areas of onshore oil and natural gas development in the United States, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region, Marcellus/Utica Shale and DJ/Powder River Basin.
Our Directional Drilling segment provides the highly technical and essential services of guiding horizontal and directional drilling operations for E&P companies. We offer premium drilling services including directional drilling, horizontal drilling, under balanced drilling, MWD and logging tools. Our package also offers various technologies, including our positive pulse MWD navigational tool fleet, Q-Series Mud Motors and ancillary downhole tools, as well as EM navigational systems. We also provide a suite of integrated and related services, including rotational gamma, pressure-while-drilling, continuous inclination and continuous azimuth. 
Although we do not typically enter into long-term contracts for our services in this segment, we have long standing relationships with our customers in this segment and believe they will continue to utilize our services. As of the year ended December 31, 2019, 85.7% of our directional drilling activity was tied to “follow-me rigs,” which involve non-contractual, generally recurring services as our Directional Drilling team members follow a drilling rig from well-to-well or pad-to-pad for multiple wells or pads, and in some cases, multiple years. With increasing use of pad drilling we have increased the number of “follow me rigs” from approximately 32 in January of 2016 to 56 as of December 31, 2019. We intend to continue to re-deploy additional MWD kits into 2020, as market conditions warrant.
Our Directional Drilling segment accounted for approximately 47.1%, 31.9% and 33.2% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Pressure Pumping
We supply pressure pumping services that include hydraulic fracturing stimulation services, cementing services and acidizing services. In particular, we focus on fracturing, cementing and acidizing services in the Permian Basin, Mid-Continent region and the DJ/Powder River Basin. These pressure pumping and stimulation services are primarily used in the completion, production and maintenance of oil and gas wells. We provide these services to large public E&P operators as well as independent oil and gas producers.
We focus on providing services for larger hydraulic fracturing jobs, but have the capability to provide a customized range of hydraulic fracturing services to meet the particular needs of our customers. We believe our technical capabilities, depth of talent and operational flexibility allow us to provide superior service quality to our customers. Additionally, we are well suited as a result of our basin-specific experience which we believe allows us to be responsive to our customers’ needs, increasing the utilization of our assets and strengthening our existing customer relationships.
As of December 31, 2019, our pressure pumping services had the capacity to provide 253,150 HHP, of which 241,500 HHP was dedicated to hydraulic fracturing, 5,350 HHP was dedicated to cementing and 6,300 HHP was dedicated to acidizing and other. As of December 31, 2019, we had 54,750 total hydraulic fracturing HHP deployed in the Mid-Continent region, 54,500 total hydraulic HHP deployed in the Permian Basin, 17,400 total hydraulic HHP deployed in the Rockies. Due to the decrease in pressure pumping demand, we deactivated three of our pressure pumping hydraulic fracturing fleets during 2019, one in January 2019, one in March 2019 and another in October 2019. As a result, as of December 2019, 110,300 total hydraulic HHP was not deployed. 
5

Of our total deployed HHP dedicated to hydraulic fracturing, approximately 86.25% is dedicated to unconventional fracturing services in the Mid-Continent region and Permian Basin and 13.75% is dedicated to unconventional and conventional fracturing services in the Rockies. We have successfully grown our pressure pumping services through organic growth and acquisitions. From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2019, we increased from 15,500 HHP to 253,150 HHP. 
In addition, we also have 13,250 tons of flat sand storage in Enid, Oklahoma in our facility located on the BNSF Railway, which provides access to the materials needed to ensure consistently reliable operations. 
Our Pressure Pumping segment accounted for approximately 18.6%, 35.4% and 35.0% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Pressure Control
We supply pressure control services that include supplying a wide variety of equipment, services and expertise in support of completion and workover operations throughout the United States. Its capabilities include coiled tubing, snubbing, fluid pumping, nitrogen, well control and other pressure control related services. Our pressure control equipment is tailored to the unconventional resources market with the ability to operate under high pressures without having to delay or cease production during completion operations. We provide pressure control services primarily in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region, DJ/Powder River Basin, Haynesville Shale and East Texas Basin.
Our coiled tubing units are used in the provision of unconventional completion services or in support of well-servicing and workover applications. Our rig-assisted snubbing units are used in conjunction with a workover rig to insert or remove downhole tools or in support of other well services while maintaining pressure in the well, or in support of unconventional completions. Our nitrogen pumping units provide a non-combustible environment downhole and are used in support of other pressure control or well-servicing applications. We also offer highly-technical and specialized well control services, which are typically required in response to emergencies at the well site, requiring a variety of solutions including freezing, hot tapping and gate valve drilling services, as well as critical well control and containment operations. Our team is comprised of oilfield services veterans with extensive domestic and international experience in well control operations. 
As of December 31, 2019, we provided pressure control services through our fleet of 24 coiled tubing units (10 of which are Large Diameter units, allowing us to service extended reach laterals), 36 rig-assisted snubbing units and 24 nitrogen pumping units. 
Our Pressure Control segment accounted for approximately 22.0%, 20.3% and 20.5% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Wireline
We provide new well wireline conveyed tight-shale reservoir perforating services across many of the major U.S. shale basins and also offers a range of services such as cased-hole investigation and production logging services, conventional wireline, mechanical services and pipe recovery services. These services are offered in both new well completions and for remedial work. The majority of the revenues generated by our wireline services are derived from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region, Haynesville Shale and East Texas Basin as well as in industrial and petrochemical facilities.
As of December 31, 2019, we operated 33 wireline units of which 21 are suited for unconventional activity, and operated from seven facilities throughout the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent, South Texas and Gulf Coast regions. Of the 21 wireline units suited for unconventional activity, 5 units are crewed and the remaining 16 are available to deploy as conditions warrant. We offer our wireline services in most markets in which we provide pressure pumping services. From January 2017 to December 31, 2019, we completed approximately 28,174 stages in the United States with an overall run efficiency of approximately 98.3%. 
Our Wireline segment accounted for approximately 12.3%, 12.4% and 11.4% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Geographic Areas of Operation 
Our Directional Drilling segment operates in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region, Marcellus/Utica Shale and DJ/Powder River Basin. Our Completion and Production segment operates in different geographical areas across the United States. We provide pressure pumping services in the Permian and Mid-Continent region where we have a leading market position, as well as the Rocky Mountain region (including the Williston Basin). We provide pressure control services in the Mid-Continent region, Eagle Ford Shale, Permian Basin, DJ/Powder River Basin, Haynesville Shale, Fayetteville Shale and Williston Basin (including the Bakken Shale), providing access across the continental United States. Lastly, we provide wireline services throughout the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Mid-Continent region, Gulf Coast region and East Texas/Haynesville Shale. These expansive operating areas provide us with access to a number of nearby unconventional crude oil and natural gas basins, both with existing 
6

customers expanding their production footprint and third parties acquiring new acreage. Our proximity to existing and prospective customer activities allows us to anticipate or respond quickly to such customers’ needs and efficiently deploy our assets. 
We believe that our strategic geographic positioning will benefit us as activity increases in our core operating areas. Our broad geographic footprint provides us with exposure to the ongoing recovery in drilling and completion activity and will allow us to opportunistically pursue new business in basins with the most active drilling environments. 
Seasonality 
Our operations are located in different regions of the United States. Some of these areas are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions. Weather conditions also affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas and, as a result, demand for our services. 
Marketing and Customers 
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies. As such, we price our services to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate by adjusting our rates to reflect current market conditions as necessary. We examine the rate of utilization of our equipment as a measure of our ability to compete in the current market environment. 
We have also established over time a diverse and balanced mix of customers, including large, midsize and small E&P companies. We served approximately 1,100 customers in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, EOG Resources represented approximately 10.1% and 11.9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no customer individually accounted for more than 10.3% of our consolidated revenues. The loss of a material customer could have an adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization and pricing levels. 
Competition 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, a company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies and drilling services contractors at competitive prices. We provide our services across the United States and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies, including some of the largest integrated oilfield services companies. 
Our major competitors for our Drilling segment include Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Phoenix Technology Services, ProDirectional, Scientific Drilling International, LEAM Drilling Systems and Nabors Industries. Our major competitors for our Pressure Pumping, Pressure Control and Wireline segments include Halliburton, Schlumberger, RPC, NexTier, Liberty, Basic Energy Services, Nine Energy Services, Superior Energy Services, Key Energy Services, Forbes Energy Services, STEP Energy Services and KLX Energy Services.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are quality of service, reputation for safety and technical proficiency, availability and price. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our services based on the local leadership and basin-expertise that our field management and operating personnel use to deliver quality services. 
Suppliers 
We have dedicated supply chain teams that manage sourcing and logistics to ensure flexibility and continuity of our supply chain in a cost effective manner across our geographic areas of operation. We have fostered long-term relationships with numerous industry leading suppliers of proppant, chemicals, coil tubing and select directional drilling, pressure pumping, pressure control and wireline equipment. 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
Intellectual Property 
We have pending applications and registered trademarks for various names under which our entities conduct business or provide services. Except for the foregoing, we do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our 
7

personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and spills and releases that can cause: 

• | personal injury or loss of life;


• | damage or destruction of property, equipment, natural resources and the environment; and


• | suspension of operations.

In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. 
Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. 
Despite our efforts to maintain safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property damage, personal injury and other losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs, insurability and our relationships with customers, employees, regulatory agencies and other parties. 
Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuations and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,100 full time employees and our overall personnel count decreased approximately 32.4% from the year ended December 31, 2018. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We also hire independent contractors and consultants as needed. 
Safety and Remediation Program 
In the oilfield services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long term E&P customer relationships is having an experienced and skilled workforce. Many of our large customers place an emphasis not only on pricing, but also on safety records and the quality management systems of contractors. We believe these factors will gain further importance in the future. We have dedicated safety personnel and training facilities for each of our two reporting segments. We have committed resources toward employee safety and quality management training programs. Our field employees are required to complete both technical field operations skills and safety training programs. 
As part of our safety procedures, we also have the capability to shut down our pressure pumping and fracturing operations both at the lines and in our data van. In addition, we maintain fire suppression systems and spill kits on location for containment of pollutants that may be spilled in the process of providing our hydraulic fracturing services. The spill kits are generally comprised of pads and booms for absorption and containment of spills, as well as soda ash for neutralizing acid. Fire extinguishers are also in place on job sites at each pump. 
We have used third-party contractors to provide remediation and spill response services when necessary to address spills that travel beyond our containment capabilities. Historically, these prior spills have not had a material adverse effect on our hydraulic fracturing services; however, we can make no assurances that prior spills or any future spills will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future. To the extent our hydraulic fracturing or other oilfield services operations result in a future spill or release, we will engage the services of a remediation company or an alternative company, as necessary, to assist us with clean-up and remediation. 
Government Regulations and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
8

We operate under the jurisdiction of a number of regulatory bodies that regulate worker safety standards, the handling of hazardous materials, the storage and transportation of explosives, the protection of human health and the environment and standards of operation. Regulations concerning equipment certification create an ongoing need for regular maintenance that is incorporated into our daily operating procedures. Moreover, the oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to local, state and federal legislation and regulatory initiatives. 
Transportation Matters 
In connection with our transportation and relocation of our oilfield service equipment and shipment of hydraulic fracturing sand, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. As such, we operate as a commercial motor carrier in providing certain of our services and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and analogous state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety, driver licensing and insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions and hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically related to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, our trucking operations are subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, onboard electronic logging device (“ELD”) requirements or limits on vehicle emissions, weight and size. 
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations but may be more stringent. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. 
Finally, from time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of contracted drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us would be enacted. 
Environmental Matters and Regulation 
General. Our operations and the operations of our oil and natural gas E&P customers are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated activities, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that may be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relating to our owned or operated facilities. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects; and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area. 
Over time, the trend in environmental regulation is typically to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly completion activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our E&P customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for personal injury to persons and damage to properties or natural resources. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Additionally, our customers may also incur increased costs or delays, restrictions or cancellations in permitting, operating or expansion activities as a result of more stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may result in a curtailment of exploration, development or production activities that would reduce the demand for our services. 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business is subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 
9

Waste Handling. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own requirements, which may be more stringent. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Additionally, drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in response to a federal consent decree issued in 2016, the EPA was required during 2019 to determine whether certain Subtitle D criteria regulations required revision in a manner that could result in oil and natural gas wastes being regulated as RCRA hazardous wastes. In April 2019, the EPA made a determination that such revision of the regulations was unnecessary. Any future loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas E&P industry’s, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on our business. 
Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state statutes impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property or natural resources damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own, lease or operate upon numerous properties and facilities that for many years have been used for industrial activities, including oil and natural gas-related operations. Hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned, leased or operated upon by us, or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons, were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes and remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination), including instances where the prior owner or operator caused the contamination, or perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. 
Handling of and Exposure to Radioactive Materials. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) associated with oil and natural gas deposits and, accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. Any NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because certain of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us may have been used for oil and natural gas production operations, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with NORM. 
In addition, some of our operations utilize equipment that contains sealed, low-grade radioactive sources. Our activities involving the use of radioactive materials are regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) and also by state regulatory agencies under agreement with the NRC. Standards implemented by these regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of such radioactive materials. These regulatory agencies have adopted regulations implementing and enforcing these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. 
Water Discharges and Discharges into Belowground Formations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the Clean Water Act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws also may impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges. In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) under the Obama Administration published a final rule outlining federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, including wetlands. In 2017, the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule made effective on December 23, 2019, rescinding the 2015 rule. On January 23, 2020, the two agencies issued a final 
10

rule re-defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction over waters of the United States, which redefinition is narrower than found in the 2015 rule. Upon being published in the Federal Register and the passage of 60 days thereafter, the January 23, 2020 final rule will become effective, at which point the United States will be covered under a single regulatory scheme as it relates to federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. However, there remains the expectation that the January 23, 2020 final rule also will be legally challenged in federal district court. To the extent that any challenge to the January 23, 2020 final rule is successful and the 2015 rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our oil and natural gas E&P customers conduct operations, we or our customers could incur increased costs and our customers could incur delays or cancellations in permitting or projects, which could reduce demand for our services. 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including E&P facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil into waters of the United States. 
We believe that our oil and natural gas E&P customers dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with more significant rates of induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. Since that time, the United States Geological Survey indicates that these rates have decreased in these states, although concern continues to exist over quakes arising from induced seismic activities. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Texas and Oklahoma have issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting restrictions, operating restrictions and/or reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults. States may, from time to time, develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s (“OCC”) Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance in late 2016, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operator’s planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. In recent years, the OCC’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division has issued orders limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected belowground into the Arbuckle formation in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. 
These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in our customers having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used to dispose of customer wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers’ business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our services, which would could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Air Emissions. Certain of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and analogous state laws require permits for certain facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. These laws and their implementing regulations also impose generally applicable limitations on air emissions and require adherence to maintenance, work practice, reporting and record keeping, and other requirements. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit or other regulatory requirements could result in the imposition of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we or our oil and natural gas E&P customers could be required to shut down or retrofit existing equipment, leading to additional expenses and operational delays. 
Many of these regulatory requirements, including new source performance standards (“NSPS”) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards are expected to be made more stringent over time as a result of stricter ambient air quality standards and other air quality protection goals adopted by the EPA. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition 
11

and business. For example, in 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQs”), for ground-level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the eight-hour primary and secondary standards. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. States are also expected to implement requirements as a result of this NAAQs final rule, which could result in longer permitting timelines, delay, restrict or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development or expansion of oil and natural gas projects and increase costs for us and our customers. Moreover, our business could be materially affected if our E&P customers’ operations are significantly affected by these or other similar requirements. These requirements could increase the cost of doing business for us and our customers and reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, and thus have an adverse effect on the demand for our services. 
Climate Change. The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs") as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas E&P customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.
The U.S. Congress ("Congress") and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, implement Clean Air Act emission standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020.
Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, in the form of pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. Critical declarations made by one or more presidential candidates include proposals to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Presidential candidates may also pursue more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquified natural gas export facilities, as well as the re-entrance by the United States’ into the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments, and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. 
There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending and investment practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy re could result in the restriction, delay, or cancellation of drilling programs or development of production activities. 
The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas E&P customers restricting or cancelling production activities, 
12

incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our services. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events. If any such climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our E&P customers.
Regulation of Endangered Species. 
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened and endangered species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. If harm to species or damages to habitat occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and natural gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, may seek criminal penalties. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect these species or their habitat could delay, restrict or prohibit drilling in certain areas by our oil and natural gas E&P customers, which could reduce demand for our services. 
In addition, the FWS may make determinations on the listing of species as endangered or threatened under the ESA and litigation with respect to the listing or non-listing of certain species as endangered or threatened may result in more fulsome protections for non-protected or lesser-protected species. For example, in 2015, the FWS decided to list the northern long-eared bat, whose range covers more than two-thirds of the states in the eastern and north-central regions of the U.S., as threatened rather than the more protective designation of endangered. However, a federal court decision issued in January 2020 found that the FWS failed to conduct a sufficient analysis that could have resulted in the bat being declared as endangered and the court remanded the listing decision to the FWS for a new determination on the species’ protected status. The designation of previously unprotected species or re-designation of lesser-protected species as threatened or endangered in areas where our E&P customers operate could cause certain of our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their E&P activities that could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services to those customers. 
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing 
We perform hydraulic fracturing services for our oil and natural gas E&P customers. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. 
Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority and performed investigations over aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities as well as published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, the EPA has issued final CAA regulations governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) released during hydraulic fracturing. However, in September 2019, EPA proposed an amendment to the methane and VOC standards that would remove the methane-specific requirements that currently apply in favor of relying on the emission limits for VOCs. The EPA also has published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plant. The Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM’s decision to rescind the 2015 rule is pending in federal district court. Also, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. 
From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. However, concern over the threat of climate change has resulted in the making of pledges by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020 to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. 
13

Moreover, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, Texas and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Additionally, in April 2019, the Governor of Colorado signed Senate Bill 19-181 into law, which legislation, among other things, revises the mission of the state oil and gas agency from fostering energy development in the state to instead focusing on regulating the industry in a manner that is protective of public health and safety and the environment, as well as authorizing cities and counties to regulate oil and natural gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing activities, within their jurisdiction. States could also elect to place certain prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing, following the approach taken by the States of Maryland, New York and Vermont. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Moreover, non-governmental organizations may seek to restrict hydraulic fracturing; notwithstanding the adoption of Colorado Senate Bill 19-181 in 2019, one or more interest groups in the state have already filed new ballot initiatives with the state in January 2020, in hopes of extending drilling setbacks from oil and natural gas development. If new federal, state or local laws, regulations, presidential executive orders or ballot initiatives that significantly restrict or ban some or all of hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and prohibit or make more difficult or costly the performance of hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas E&P activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services as well as our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 
Historically, our hydraulic fracturing compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not have a material adverse effect in the future. It is possible, that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, ballot initiatives and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify. 
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry could affect the demand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations. 
Drilling. Our oil and natural gas E&P customers’ operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state and some counties and municipalities in which our E&P customers are located also regulate one or more of the following: 

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; and


• | notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.

State Regulation. States regulate the drilling for oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. Historically, our compliance with these laws has not had a material adverse effect on us but there can be no assurance that such compliance will not result in material adverse effects on our business in the future. To the extent that such laws and regulations result in the curtailment of our oil and natural gas E&P customers’ operations or production, we may incur decreased demand for our services, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
14

Storage and Handling of Explosive Materials. 
Our wireline service operations involve the handling of explosive materials for our oil and natural gas E&P customers. Despite our use of specialized facilities to store explosive materials and intensive employee training programs, the handling of explosive materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and other third parties could also occur. Any explosive incident could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages, including environmental natural resource damages, or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Occupational Safety and Health Matters 
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act which is administered and enforced by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Historically, our worker safety compliance costs, including with respect to general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances, have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not have a material adverse effect in the future. OSHA continues to evaluate worker safety and to propose new regulations, such as the 2016 final rule regarding respirable silica sand. The imposition of more stringent requirements regarding worker safety could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete, financial condition and results of operations.
