Overview
 We are a development stage, medical device company focused on the design, development, and eventual commercialization of an innovative insulin pump to address shortcomings and problems represented by the relatively limited adoption of currently available pumps for insulin-requiring people with diabetes.
 
Diabetes is typically classified as either type 1 or type 2:
 

· | Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body’s nearly complete inability to produce insulin. It is frequently diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin therapy to survive.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Type 2 diabetes represents over 90% of all individuals diagnosed with diabetes and is characterized by the body’s inability to either properly utilize insulin or produce enough insulin. Initially, many people with type 2 diabetes attempt to manage their diabetes with improvements in diet and exercise and/or the use of oral medications and/or injection of glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, drugs. However, as their diabetes advances, patients progress to require insulin therapies, such as once-daily long-acting insulin, and, ultimately, intensified mealtime rapid-acting insulin therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Glucose, the primary source of energy for cells, must be maintained at certain levels in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. In people with diabetes, blood glucose levels fluctuate between very high, a condition known as hyperglycemia, and very low, a condition called hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia can lead to serious long-term complications, including blindness, kidney disease, nervous system disease, occlusive vascular diseases, lower-limb amputation, stroke and cardiovascular disease, and death. Hypoglycemia can lead to confusion or loss of consciousness, often requiring a visit to the emergency room or, in certain cases, result in seizures, coma, and death.
 
The International Diabetes Federation, or IDF, estimates that, in 2019, approximately 460 million people had diabetes worldwide, and, that by 2045, this number will increase to 700 million people. According to the Seagrove 2021 Diabetes Blue Book, approximately 27 million people in the United States have diagnosed diabetes, of which type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 7%, or approximately 1.8 million people. All people with type 1 diabetes, which is our primary market, require daily insulin. According to the Seagrove 2021 Diabetes Blue Book, approximately 18% of people with type 2 diabetes in the United States, or 4.7 million people, require insulin (basal alone represent 3.1 million and basal plus mealtime represent 1.6 million) to manage their diabetes. In this Report, we refer to people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who require mealtime insulin as “insulin-requiring people with diabetes.”
 
Currently, there are two primary therapies available for insulin-requiring people with diabetes: multiple daily insulin injections directly into the body through syringes or insulin pens, referred to as Multiple Daily Injection, or MDI therapy, or the use of an insulin pump to deliver a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or CSII therapy, into the body. Generally, CSII therapy is considered to provide a number of advantages over MDI therapy, primarily an improvement in glycemic control, as measured by certain diabetes management tests. Use of CSII has proven to improve clinical outcomes while, importantly, reducing emergency room visits associated with low glucose.
 
Notwithstanding these advantages, the difficulty in use resulting from the complexity and cumbersome design of available insulin pumps, as well as high and often prohibitive costs for both the patient and insurance provider, has resulted not only in dissatisfaction among many existing pump users, but also has severely limited the adoption rate of insulin pumps by a segment of the diabetes population, who we refer to in this Report as “almost pumpers.”
 We generally define almost pumpers as persons with insulin-requiring diabetes who are aware of pumps and the potential benefits but, because of the shortcomings, cost, and complexity-of-use problems prevalent in available insulin pumps, continue to receive their daily insulin through MDI therapy.
 
Our initial target market for our insulin pump is the almost pumper population located in the United States.

-

Based upon our knowledge of the diabetes industry and information available and/or obtained by us, we believe that an estimated 31% of Americans with type 1 diabetes use insulin pump therapy and an estimated 30% of Americans with type 1 diabetes are whom we classify as almost pumpers. The remainder of the population treat their diabetes via MDI therapy.
 Our design and development team is led by Paul DiPerna, our chairman, chief executive officer, and our largest shareholder. Mr. DiPerna has over 30 years of high-level experience in developing, designing, and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval for and managing the commercialization of medical devices, including consumer and hospital-based insulin pumps, while working for such industry leading medical device companies as Baxter Healthcare, Inc., or Baxter, a supplier of drug therapies and associated pumping technologies, and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc., or Tandem, a leading supplier of pumping technology to the existing insulin pumping marketplace, Mr. DiPerna was the founder of Tandem and designer of its initial product.
 Our Insulin Pump Prototype
 We have designed and developed working prototypes of our low-cost insulin pump that are now undergoing the testing required to submit for FDA approval. During this period, we have, and continue to devote, substantial time and resources to better understand the needs and preferences of almost pumpers to enable us to modify and refine our insulin pump to the needs and preferences of this target market. To help us better understand their needs and preferences, we obtained information about our target market and their care givers through one on one interviews, human factors testing, on-line and in person surveys, and focus groups at industry related tradeshows and conferences.
 Pre-Commercialization Steps
 While we have substantially completed the general engineering and mechanical aspects of our insulin pump prototype, prior to commercializing, we still must successfully complete a number of material steps including:
 

· | Continue to modify, refine and finalize our prototype so that it meets:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the general needs and preferences of our almost-pumper target market based upon our knowledge of the diabetes industry and information available and/or obtained by us from almost pumpers and their caregivers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | the general guidelines of third-party payors, private and public insurance companies, preferred provider organizations and other managed care providers with particular focus on the guidelines established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS which administrates the United States Medicare program, or Medicare. To assist us in making such modifications and refinements, we have retained independent consultants to focus on ensuring that our product satisfies the existing coverage and reimbursement criteria of such third-party payors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to work closely with our regulatory consultants to complete, finalize and file our submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance and all other documentation necessary to obtain approval of our insulin pump. This will include:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | engaging the FDA in a pre-submission conference to ensure that we understand and meet the FDA’s requirements, expectations and standards with regard to approval of our product. At this meeting, our team, including our FDA regulatory consultant, received FDA comments and guidance regarding our proposed submission during the pre-market notification period for 510(k) clearance (including any suggested modifications to the device description, indications for use or summary of supporting data contained in the notification);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | preparing and ensuring that our pre-market notification, which will be part of our FDA submission, demonstrates that our insulin pump, which is substantially equivalent to an insulin pump previously cleared by the FDA and legally marketed to the public; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | preparing our submission to the FDA, to include all of the appropriate results of tests (relating to, among other things, user effectiveness, sterility, pump efficiency and shipping compatibility) demonstrating safety and efficacy of our insulin pump in satisfaction of the mandates of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, or the FDCA, including requirements with regard to registration and listing, labeling, medical device reporting and good manufacturing practices. We currently expect to make this submission in the fourth calendar quarter of 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Refine our manufacturing process during the submission process to identify and select a manufacturer of our insulin pump through a competitive bidding process, as we prepare for our product introduction;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5
-


· | Take such actions, if any, as may be required by the FDA as a condition to granting approval and providing 510(k) clearance for our insulin pump; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hire and retain appropriate sales and marketing personnel to develop, implement and launch a promotional campaign for our insulin pump substantially focused on our target market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As with any medical device attempting to enter and successfully compete with existing products in an established and competitive marketplace, we will face significant hurdles to accomplish the above steps to commercialization including:
 

· | Obtaining FDA 510(k) clearance to market and sell our insulin pump to the public;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obtaining any other FDA-required approvals with regard to our product, as required by the FDCA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Educating endocrinologists, physician’s assistants, nurse practitioners and nurse educators, who typically prescribe pump usage, and certified diabetes educators and dieticians, who provide education and guidance to diabetes patients, as to what we believe to be the superior qualities of our product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Demonstrating to select general practitioners, who have historically been skeptical of the heightened support inherent in insulin pumps, our product’s ease of use and convenience;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that our final product does, in fact, meet the needs of almost-pumpers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overcoming the historic obstacles and reluctance of almost-pumpers to using insulin pumps to treat their diabetes; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that third party payors agree to cover all or a substantial portion of the purchase price and recurring costs of the use of our insulin pump.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that there are a number of shortcomings and issues with currently available insulin pumps that prevent a substantial number of people who require insulin on a daily basis from choosing an insulin pump to treat their diabetes. We believe, that by tailoring our insulin pump to address such factors, we can expand the scope and adoption rate of insulin pump usage. We believe that to achieve broader market acceptance, an insulin pump must be easier to learn to use, be less time consuming to operate, more intuitive to both patients and physicians, and meet the standards for coverage by insurance providers so that co-payments required from patients are affordable and the hurdles to insurance coverage are significantly reduced.
 Among the more prominent issues are:
 
· | Complexity: Many existing pumps are highly complex and require significant technical expertise to use effectively. We believe such pumps were designed for “super users,” who have high levels of motivation and technical competence. The complexity of pumps proves daunting to less technically inclined users.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cumbersome: We believe that a majority of existing pumps are bulky and difficult to manage, in many cases requiring additional equipment to introduce a catheter to the patient’s body and up to 48 inches of tubing, which must be replaced frequently, to connect the catheter to a pump. This requires users to carry spare parts and other equipment adding to the encumbrance of using the pump.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cost: Costs associated with insulin pump therapy are high and can be prohibitive, especially for those on fixed or limited incomes. These costs vary by pump, but multi-thousand-dollar upfront payments, often with substantial co-payments in addition to possible daily co-payments on consumables, can easily place current pumps out of reach for patients. This makes insurance providers hesitant to pay for them, leading to limited or absent reimbursement/coverage and high hurdles for patients to gain access.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our team has substantial knowledge of the diabetes space and experience in developing, winning approval for, and bringing insulin pumps to market. Based on this experience, we believe that our innovative insulin pump, using a new and proprietary method of pumping insulin, can address most or all of these shortcomings. It provides a state-of-the-art insulin pump capable of both basal (steady flow) and bolus (mealtime dosing) insulin disbursement. It also has been designed considering a natural migration path to multi-chamber/multi-liquid pumps, potentially offering an exciting array of new therapies to patients with diabetes and other conditions. Our goal is to become the leader in expanding access to insulin pump technology to a wider portion of diabetes sufferers and provide not just care for the super users, but “diabetes care for the rest of us.”

Mr. DiPerna, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary and treasurer, began his career in approximately 1980 as a mechanical design engineer in the automated test equipment industry before moving in approximately 1989 to a start-up company in the blood separation sciences industry. This company was acquired in approximately 1991 by Baxter. Following such acquisition, he became employed by Baxter and held various positions for approximately 12 years. While at Baxter, Mr. DiPerna led significant projects and initiatives, including leading a team of approximately 50 engineers in developing equipment in the blood separation sciences industry. In approximately 1996, he was promoted to General Manager of Baxter’s business development group to identify expansion opportunities in the medical device industry for Baxter. While holding such position, Mr. DiPerna led a team of approximately 20 personnel responsible for researching custom orthopedics, digital dentistry, and rapid prototyping. In such role, one of his assignments was identifying opportunities in the diabetes industry. As a result, Mr. DiPerna developed an expertise and knowledge and became well known in the diabetes industry and led attempts by Baxter to acquire three then-leading insulin pump manufacturers. In 2003, Mr. DiPerna, using his knowledge and experience acquired at Baxter in the diabetes industry and in the “pump” product business in particular, left Baxter and founded what subsequently became Tandem. While at Tandem, Mr. DiPerna held various positions, including member of the board of directors, chief executive officer, and chief technology officer. Tandem is a medical device company that designs, develops and commercializes products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Tandem was founded by Mr. DiPerna to design, develop and commercialize a “state of the art” user-friendly insulin pump. He was the person primarily responsible for the design concept and development of Tandem’s insulin pump, which, after commercial introduction, it is estimated by Mr. DiPerna such insulin pump had a quick ramp up to 5,000 purchasers. In 2011, Mr. DiPerna resigned from his executive officer position and board seat at Tandem and continued to advise the company through 2013. He co-invented a medical device used for blood-borne infection control called the “Curos Cap.” Curos Cap was owned by a private company which was acquired by 3M Corporation in 2015 for $150,000,000. Thereafter, Mr. DiPerna founded Fuel Source Partners, LLC to incubate early stage medical-device products and accumulate technical talent. One of such proposed products was spun-out to Quasuras, Inc., or Quasuras, in March 2015, which we acquired in July 2017. Mr. DiPerna holds a number of issued and pending patents and is a member of the American Diabetes Association. Mr. DiPerna received a Master’s in Engineering Management from Northeastern University and a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Lowell. From January 2017 until July 2019, Mr. DiPerna served at National Cardiac Incorporated as its Chief Executive Officer and as a board member to leverage their technology in the cardiac monitoring space.
 The Market
 
Generally, there are two primary therapies used by people with insulin-requiring diabetes: insulin injections and insulin pumps. Each is designed to supplement or replace the insulin-producing function of the pancreas. MDI therapy involves the use of syringes or insulin pens to inject insulin into the body, as required. Insulin pumps are used to provide a steady flow of insulin (often referred to as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or basal rate insulin) and bursts of mealtime insulin (boluses). Insulin pump therapy has been shown to provide people with insulin-requiring diabetes with numerous advantages compared to MDI therapy. The steady flow of insulin and the easier application of mealtime boluses has been shown by numerous clinical studies to result in lower HbA1c (a measure of the amount of glucose in the bloodstream) when compared to MDI therapy. This results in lower rates of hospitalization and a reduction in overall adverse events for people with diabetes.
 We believe that the greater efficacy of pumps compared to MDI makes insulin pumps a more optimal choice for persons in managing diabetes, but that the shortcomings and challenges around existing pumps have held back adoption rates.
 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Report in the United States, in 2018, 88 million people, or 1 out of 3 adults, had pre-diabetes, approximately 27 million people had been diagnosed with diabetes and an additional 7 million people had diabetes that was undiagnosed. The CDC also indicated that diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2017, which according to the CDC, may be underreported. Diabetes was the leading cause of kidney failure, lower-limb amputations, and adult-onset blindness and represented more than $327 billion in medical costs in 2017.
 
We believe that due to a number of factors, including the large consumption of processed foods and the growing obesity problem in the United States, the number of persons requiring daily administration of insulin will continue to grow at rapid rates.
 
The category of persons with diabetes requiring daily insulin administration is our target market, and we believe our proposed product has the potential to substantially improve the day to day quality of life of such persons.
 
The Opportunity
 
We believe the insulin pump market is large and growing, but, generally, has been poorly served by existing products that have limited the adoption of insulin pumps. We believe an insulin pump having the correct mix of efficiency, reliability, features that are easy to understand and use, and offered at an affordable price point will drive a substantial percentage of “almost-pumpers” to use insulin pumps and persons currently using available, but less than optimal pumps, to switch to such a more desirable product. We believe that such an insulin pump can improve glucose control, and, therefore, the user’s quality of life while substantially mitigating adverse diabetes-related health risks and many, if not all, of the challenges and shortcomings discussed herein.
 
We believe there is a substantial opportunity to penetrate the type 2 MDI marketplace, whether through this new insulin pump or further simplification of pumps for the type 2 marketplace.

As set forth in general terms herein, we believe existing pumps have numerous shortcomings and challenges including:
 
Outdated style. Consumer electronics devices have evolved in both form and function. Diabetes pumps have not experienced similar progress. We believe that consumers will be more receptive of products designed with the user experience in mind and that many have low tolerance for complex, difficult procedures for use and maintenance of products.
 Bulky size. We believe that consumers view traditional pumps, especially those with tubing, to be large, bulky, and inconvenient to carry or wear, especially when compared to modern consumer electronic devices. The size of the pump further contributes to users being embarrassed by the pump. We believe a simple patch style of pump will drive adoption.
 
Pump mechanism limitations. Traditional pumps generally utilize a syringe and plunger mechanism to deliver insulin. We believe this design limits the ability to reduce the size of the pump, and also potentially exposes the user to the unintended delivery of the full volume of insulin within the pump, which can cause hypoglycemia or death. We believe that the fear of adverse health events due to technical malfunctions related to traditional pump mechanism limitations deters the adoption of insulin pump therapy.
 Costs. Existing pumps are expensive, with the more popular models having purchase prices exceeding $4,000 for individuals without health insurance and often require significant patient copays. Others have daily use costs that exceed the reimbursement rates of many health insurance plans, forcing some users to spend thousands of dollars a year in copays. We believe this makes insurers hesitant to pay for pumps for any but their best and most compliant patients and places pumps out of reach for many patients who cannot afford such out of pocket expenses.
 Our Solution
 Our proposed pump is being designed and developed to address the above shortcomings and to appeal to: (i) the substantial group of “almost-pumpers” who are currently interested in using an insulin pump, but have not done so because of the complexity, cost or cumbersome nature of existing products, and (ii) people who are using one of the currently available insulin pumps but are dissatisfied with such products. We believe that, owing to our new proprietary technology, our proposed insulin pump will be the simplest and least expensive product on the market and the easiest for providers to prescribe.
 
Our current pump prototype of our proposed pump has been built to test what we believe to be our novel approach to insulin pumps. By providing a pump that we believe will establish industry standards in terms of technology, simplicity to understand, ease of use and price, we believe our proposed pump will offer the vast majority of benefits afforded by more expensive and complex pumps but remain accessible to a substantially greater percentage of diabetes sufferers requiring daily insulin therapy.
 
We believe people generally will not use technology that intimidates them and physicians are hesitant to prescribe such technology. We believe mass market products, such as is intended for our proposed pump, must be “user friendly” and affordable. We believe this approach is fundamentally different from that applied to the existing pump market today where most pumps are continuously adding complex features and are “user friendly” to only the most technically astute.
 
Our current goal is to successfully design, develop and obtain all required regulatory approvals for our proposed insulin pump, and, thereafter, commercialize the finished product. Our long-term goal is to become a leading provider of insulin pump therapy by focusing on both consumer and clinical needs.
 
To achieve our above stated immediate and current goals, we intend to pursue the following business strategies:
 
Use of innovative proprietary technology. 
 
Based upon Mr. DiPerna’s substantial experience in engineering design and innovative technology in the medical device industry and, in particular, with insulin pumps, we have generated proprietary technology that has been incorporated into our proposed insulin pump. Generally, this technology is involved in the delivery of insulin to the user at the appropriate and necessary times. We believe this technology will greatly assist us in creating a simpler, user-friendly pump. We believe the proposed design, engineering and technology being incorporated into our proposed pump will make it substantially simpler and more affordable than those currently available. These features, together with the safety and reliability of our proposed pump, are designed to create the next generation of insulin pumps that will feature important and well-differentiated attributes compared to those currently available and make it available to consumers across mostly all socioeconomic groups in the United States and around the world.
 
Keep costs low during our design and development process. 
 
To attempt to ensure that we have sufficient funds to design, develop, and obtain all required regulatory approvals for our proposed insulin pump without having to sacrifice quality and efficiency, we intend to maintain a tight budget and limit expenditures where possible. We believe this will be possible because of the extensive knowledge and experience of Mr. DiPerna, not only in the diabetes industry and more specifically in the insulin pump device market, but also his experience in designing and developing insulin pumps and other medical devices and his ability to manage a small, focused development team. We currently expect that various other expenses, such as product scale up, and sales and marketing costs, will not be incurred until such time as development work is completed and regulatory approvals obtained.

-

Employ experienced engineers selected, supervised, and led by Mr. DiPerna, a highly experienced and respected engineer and executive in the insulin pump industry. 
 
To attempt to ensure our proposed insulin pump is “state of the art,” functional, and efficient, as well as to conserve funds, substantially all of our employees will initially be hand-picked engineers under the leadership of Mr. DiPerna. We believe that there is a strong pool of engineers with significant applicable experience and knowledge who we will be able to initially employ on a contract and/or outsource basis to help us design and develop our proposed insulin pump. We believe by hiring such persons on an out-source basis, we will save substantial resources and by having Mr. DiPerna lead and focus the team on technological and mechanical aspects of our proposed insulin pump, we believe our team will be well guided, focused, cost efficient, and able to efficiently design and develop our product that we believe can eventually be a competitive and popular choice for people with insulin requiring diabetes.
 
Government Regulation
 
The medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state regulatory agencies. The regulations are very complex and are subject to rapid change and varying interpretations. Regulatory restrictions or changes could limit our ability to bring our proposed product to the commercialization stage as a result of higher than anticipated costs to obtain regulatory approval. The FDA and other U.S. governmental agencies regulate numerous elements of our proposed product at various stages, including:

· | product design and development; 
--+------------------------------------------------------
· | pre-clinical and clinical testing and trials; 
· | product safety; 
· | establishment registration and product listing; 
· | labeling and storage; 
· | marketing, manufacturing, sales and distribution; 
· | pre-market clearance or approval; 
· | servicing and post-market surveillance; 
· | advertising and promotion; and 
· | recalls and field safety corrective actions. 

 
Even if we obtain all regulatory approvals, before we can market or sell our proposed product, we must obtain either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a pre-market approval application, a PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market, known as a “predicate” device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support a determination of substantial equivalence. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based on extensive data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, such as our proposed insulin pump. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, such as our proposed insulin pump, can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all for our proposed product.
 
If the FDA requires us to go through a more rigorous examination for our proposed product than we currently expect, we will require substantial additional funding sooner than anticipated and/or our product could be severely delayed, or our efforts ceased. We anticipate that our proposed product will require the 510(k) clearance process.
  
9
-

The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of our proposed pump device for many reasons, including:
 

· | our inability to demonstrate that our product is safe and effective for its intended users; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the data from our clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval; and 
· | failure of the manufacturing process or facilities we use to meet applicable requirements. 

 
In addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our proposed product.
 
Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our proposed product under development could prevent us from generating revenue therefrom or achieving profitability. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some customers from using our proposed product and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our proposed product.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to commercialize and sell our proposed pump and result in enforcement actions such as fines, civil penalties, injunctions, warning letters, recalls of products, delays in the introduction of products into the market, refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant future clearances or approvals, and the suspension or withdrawal of existing approvals by the FDA or other regulators. Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had 20 employees all of whom are located in the United States, consisting of 16 in research and development and manufacturing operations and 4 in marketing and general and administrative functions.
Competition
 
Medtronic, Inc., Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. and Insulet Corporation are all much larger companies with substantially greater resources than us that make similar products for the more sophisticated, technically capable person with diabetes.  We do not intend to directly compete for those individuals with diabetes, instead we intend to offer a simple to use more cost-effective solution to attract the more mainstream patients.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks, maintain trade secret and know-how protection, enforce our proprietary rights against infringers, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Because of the length of time and expense associated with developing new products and bringing them through the regulatory approval process, the health care industry places considerable emphasis on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for new technologies, products, processes, know-how, and methods. 
 
As of May 31, 2021, we had six pending U.S. utility patent applications, two pending foreign patent applications and two pending international PCT patent applications on various aspects of our technology, including our proprietary fluid movement technology. There can be no assurance that the pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage.
 
Corporate History and Background
 
We were formed as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada in October 1998 under the name Bear Lake Recreation Inc. We had no material business operations from 2002 until July 2017, when we acquired Quasuras, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Quasuras), in the Acquisition (as defined below). Prior to the Acquisition, and, since at least 2002, we were a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).
 
The Control Block Acquisition. On April 26, 2017, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 5, 2017, by and among Manchester Explorer, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (Manchester Explorer), the Company and certain persons named therein, Manchester Explorer purchased from us 2,900,000 shares of our common stock representing in excess of a majority of our then issued and outstanding common stock, for a purchase price of $375,000 (the Control Block Acquisition), resulting in a change in control of the Company. In connection with the Control Block Acquisition, James E. Besser was appointed president and a director and Morgan C. Frank was appointed the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary, treasurer and a director of ours and immediately following such appointments, our then officers and directors resigned. Mr. Besser is the managing member of and Mr. Frank is the portfolio manager and a consultant to Manchester Management Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company MMC). MMC is the general partner of Manchester Explorer and Jeb Partners, L.P. (Jeb Partners, and together with Manchester Explorer, collectively, the Purchasing Funds).

The Acquisition. On July 24, 2017, pursuant to a Reorganization and Share Exchange Agreement, by and among the Company, Paul M. DiPerna, the sole officer, director and a controlling stockholder of Quasuras, Messrs. Besser and Frank (Messrs. Besser, Frank and DiPerna, collectively, the 3 Quasuras Shareholders), and Quasuras (the Share Exchange Agreement), we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Quasuras owned by the 3 Quasuras Shareholders, resulting in Quasuras becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary (the Acquisition). Simultaneously with the closing of the Acquisition, Manchester Explorer cancelled the 2,900,000 shares of our common stock purchased in the Control Block Acquisition, Mr. Besser resigned as our president and a director and Mr. Frank resigned as our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary, and treasurer, but remained a director, and Mr. DiPerna was appointed our chairman of the board of directors, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary and treasurer.
 
In anticipation of the closing of the Acquisition, on June 27, 2017, we changed our name from “Bear Lake Recreation, Inc.” to “Modular Medical, Inc.” and changed our trading symbol from “BLKE” to “MODD.”
 
On July 28, 2017, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, as amended (the Super 8-K), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) disclosing the Acquisition and related transactions, and, upon such filing, we ceased being a shell company.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” Such designation relieves us of some of the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K.
