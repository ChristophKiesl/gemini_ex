Item 1. Business
General
ADA-ES, Inc. ("ADA"), a Colorado corporation, was incorporated in 1997. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, effective July 1, 2013, Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. ("ADES"), a Delaware company incorporated in 2011, succeeded ADA as the publicly-held corporation and ADA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADES. In 2018, ADA acquired ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC ("Carbon Solutions"). We acquired Carbon Solutions to enter into the broader activated carbon ("AC") market and to expand our product offerings in the mercury control industry and other complementary activated carbon markets. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is referred to as the "Form 10-K" or the "Report." As used in this Report, the terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" means ADES and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
We sell consumable products that utilize AC and chemical-based technologies to a broad range of customers, including coal-fired utilities, industrials, water treatment plants, and other diverse markets. Our proprietary technologies and associated product offerings provide purification solutions to enable our customers to reduce certain contaminants and pollutants to meet the challenges of existing and potential regulations.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held equity interests of 42.5% and 50.0% in Tinuum Group, LLC ("Tinuum Group") and Tinuum Services, LLC ("Tinuum Services"), respectively, which are both unconsolidated entities, and both contribute significantly to our financial position and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We account for Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services under the equity method of accounting. As described further below, both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services expect to significantly wind down their operations by the end of 2021 and we believe our Refined Coal ("RC") business will substantially cease as of December 31, 2021. 
As further discussed below, in December 2020, we changed our operational management structure, which resulted in a revision in our reporting segments, as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), to two reporting segments, RC and Advanced Purification Technologies ("APT"). Historically we had two reporting segments, RC and Power Generation and Industrials ("PGI"). The reporting segments are discussed in more detail later in this section. 
Customer Supply Agreement
On September 30, 2020, we and Cabot Norit Americas, Inc., ("Cabot") entered into a supply agreement (the "Supply Agreement") pursuant to which we agree to sell and deliver to Cabot, and Cabot agrees to purchase and accept from us, certain lignite-based activated carbon products ("Furnace Products"). The term of the Supply Agreement is for 15 years with 10-year renewal terms that are automatic unless either party provides three years prior notice of intention not to renew before the end of any term.
In addition to the sale by us and purchase by Cabot of Furnace Products, we and Cabot have agreed to additional terms whereby Cabot will reimburse us for certain capital expenditures we incur that are necessary to manufacture the Furnace Products. Reimbursements will be in the form of revenues earned from capital expenditures incurred that will benefit both us and Cabot and capital expenditures incurred that will benefit Cabot exclusively.
We believe the Supply Agreement will provide material incremental volume and capture lower operating cost efficiencies of our manufacturing plant located in Louisiana (the "Red River Plant"). As these incremental volumes come on-line and after our existing inventory balances are sold, we anticipate an increase in gross margins. Further, the Supply Agreement will expand our AC products to additional markets that are outside of coal-fired power generation.
On February 1, 2021, we and a subsidiary of Cabot Corporation ("Cabot Corporation") entered into a 5-year supply agreement ("EMEA Supply Agreement") to supply Cabot Corporation with lignite activated carbon products and other proprietary products used for mercury removal in utility and industrial coal-fired power plants in the EMEA market (as defined below). Cabot Corporation will be the exclusive and sole reseller of these products within Europe, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and we will have a first right to provide the products to Cabot for sale in the EMEA.
Acquisition of Marshall Mine
Concurrently with the execution of the Supply Agreement, on September 30, 2020, we entered into an agreement to purchase (the "Mine Purchase Agreement") from Cabot 100% of the membership interests in Marshall Mine, LLC (the "Marshall Mine Acquisition") for a nominal cash purchase price. Marshall Mine, LLC owns a lignite mine located outside of Marshall, Texas (the "Marshall Mine"). Immediately after completion of the Mine Purchase Agreement, we independently determined to commence activities to shutter the Marshall Mine, and we will incur the associated reclamation costs.
In conjunction with the execution of the Supply Agreement and the Mine Purchase Agreement, on September 30, 2020, we entered into a reclamation contract (the "Reclamation Contract") with a third party that provides a capped cost, subject to certain contingencies, in the amount of approximately $19.7 million plus an obligation to pay certain direct costs of approximately $3.6 million (collectively, the "Reclamation Costs") over the estimated reclamation period of 10 years. Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Cabot is obligated to reimburse us for $10.2 million of Reclamation Costs (the "Reclamation Reimbursements"), which are payable semi-annually over 13 years and inclusive of interest. As of September 30, 2020, we recorded an asset retirement obligation related to the Reclamation Contract in the amount of $21.3 million and a receivable related to the Reclamation Reimbursements in the amount of $9.7 million.
As the owner of the Marshall Mine, we were required to post a surety bond to ensure performance of our reclamation activities in the amount of $30.0 million under the Surety Bond Indemnification Agreement (the "Surety Agreement"). For the obligations due under the Reclamation Contract, we were required, under the Surety Agreement, to post initial collateral of $5.0 million dollars as of September 30, 2020 and to post an additional $5.0 million dollars as of March 31, 2021.
Markets
AC is a specialized sorbent material that is used widely in a host of industrial and consumer applications to remove impurities, contaminants or pollutants from gas, water and other product or waste streams. AC is produced by activating carbonaceous raw materials, including wood, coal, nut shells, resins and petroleum pitch. Properties such as surface area, pore volume and particle size can be specifically engineered to selectively target various contaminants to meet end-use application requirements. AC can come in several different forms that are important for the end-use application, including powdered activated carbon ("PAC"), granular activated carbon ("GAC"), pellets, honeycombs, blocks or cloths. 
Key markets include removal of heavy metal pollutants from coal-fired electrical generation processes, treatment of drinking and waste waters, industrial acid gas and odor removal, automotive gasoline emission control, soil and ground water remediation, and food and beverage process and product purification. 
The AC market has been and is expected to continue to be driven by increasing environmental regulations pertaining to water and air purification, especially in the mature and more industrialized areas of the world. Additionally, we believe environmental issues will continue to be the predominant force in the AC markets of rapidly developing countries.
We see opportunities to continue to pursue diverse markets for our purification products outside of coal-fire power generation, including industrial application, water treatment plants and other end markets.
Segments
Refined Coal 
Tinuum Group provides reduction of mercury and nitrogen oxide ("NOX") emissions at select coal-fired power generators through the production and sale of RC that qualifies for tax credits ("Section 45 tax credits") under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 45 - Production Tax Credit ("IRC Section 45"). We benefit from Tinuum Group's production and sale of RC through our share of earnings from Tinuum Group's sales or leases of RC facilities to tax equity investors. Both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services expect to significantly wind down their operations by the end of 2021 due to the expected expiration of the Section 45 tax credit period as of December 31, 2021. As such, our earnings and distributions from our RC segment will substantially cease as of December 31, 2021. See the separately filed financial statements of Tinuum Group included in Item 15 - "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" ("Item 15") of this Report.
Products
Our patented M-45TM and M-45-PCTM technologies (collectively, the "M-45 Technology") are proprietary pre-combustion coal treatment technologies used to control emissions from circulating fluidized bed boilers and pulverized coal boilers, respectively.
Our patented CyCleanTM technology, a pre-combustion coal treatment process provides electric power generators the ability to enhance combustion and reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides ("NOX") and mercury from coals burned in cyclone boilers.
Our patents related to the RC segment are not expected to have significant commercial application post the expected expiration of the Section 45 tax credit period.
Sales and Customers
Our RC segment derives its revenues from license royalties ("M-45 Royalties") earned under a licensing arrangement (the "M-45 License") with Tinuum Group for their use of our proprietary chemical technologies, M-45TM and M-45-PCTM (the "M-45 Technology") at their RC facilities to treat coal for the reduction of emissions of both NOX and mercury. For the year ended December 31, 2020, M-45 Royalties comprised 22% of our total consolidated revenues. M-45 Royalties are recognized based upon a percentage of the per-ton, pre-tax margin as defined in the M-45 License. We also derive substantial earnings in the RC segment from our equity method investments in Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services. Both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services expect to significantly wind down their operations by the end of 2021 due to the planned expiration of the Section 45 tax credit period as of December 31, 2021, and the loss of equity earnings and M-45 Royalties will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated operating results compared to historical periods beginning in 2022. Additional information related to major customers is disclosed in Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Coal-fired electricity generating units use RC as one of a portfolio of tools to help comply with Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS") and other environmental regulations. These RC facilities produce and sell RC that qualifies for Section 45 tax credits, including meeting the "placed in service" requirements (referred to as "placed in service"). The IRS has issued guidance regarding emissions reductions in the production of electricity by coal-fired electric generating units, including measurement and certification criteria necessary to qualify for the Section 45 tax credits. The ability to produce and sell RC and generate Section 45 tax credits, expires 10 years after each RC facility was placed in service, but not later than December 31, 2021. Two of Tinuum Group's RC facilities reached their 10-year life in 2019, and Section 45 tax credits earned from these facilities expired in December 2019. As of December 31, 2020, Tinuum Group has built and placed into service a total of 26 RC facilities that produce RC for sale to coal-fired electricity generating units, and which are still eligible to produce RC qualifying for Section 45 tax credits. The ability to generate Section 45 tax credits related to those remaining 26 RC facilities expires in 2021. 
Once an RC facility is in operation, Tinuum Group may lease or sell it to a tax equity investor, which we refer to as an "invested" RC facility. The tax equity investor subsequently operates the RC facility to produce and sell RC to a utility. It is financially advantageous for Tinuum Group to lease or sell an RC facility, as the tax equity investor assumes the operating expenses for the RC facility and remits to Tinuum Group either payments to purchase or lease payments to lease the RC facility. We benefit from equity income and cash distributions from Tinuum Group. Tax equity investors may benefit from their investment in RC facilities through the realization of tax assets and credits from the production and sale of RC.
RC facilities that are producing and selling RC and have not been leased or sold, are referred to as "retained" RC facilities, whereby the RC is produced and sold by Tinuum Group and, as an owner in Tinuum Group, we benefit from the related Section 45 tax benefits. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Section 45 tax credits were $7.301 and $7.173 per ton, respectively, of RC produced and sold to a utility. The value of the Section 45 tax credits is adjusted annually based on inflation adjustment factors published in the Federal Register. As of December 31, 2020, we have earned substantial tax credits from certain retained RC facilities through our ownership in Tinuum Group, but have not been able to fully utilize them. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Report for additional information regarding our net operating losses, tax credits and other deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2020, Tinuum Group had 23 invested RC facilities producing RC at utility sites. Absent an extension of the Section 45 tax credit period, we do not believe that Tinuum will enter into additional contracts for invested facilities during 2021. As of December 31, 2020, Tinuum Group had nine facilities that are leased to affiliates of The Goldman Sachs Group (the "GS Affiliates"), and one of these GS Affiliates is also an owner of Tinuum Group. A majority of Tinuum Group's leases of RC facilities are periodically renewed and the loss of these investors or material modification to the lease terms of these facilities would have a significant adverse impact on Tinuum Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows, which in turn would have material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Tinuum Services operates and maintains RC facilities under operating and maintenance agreements with owners or lessees of RC facilities. The owners or lessees of the RC facilities pay Tinuum Services, subject to certain limitations, the costs of operating and maintaining the RC facilities plus various fees. Tinuum Services also arranges for the purchase and delivery of certain chemical additives under chemical agency agreements that include the chemicals required for our CyCleanTM and M-45 Technologies that are necessary for the production of RC. The term of each chemical agency agreement runs concurrently with the respective RC facility's operating and maintenance agreement.
The following table provides summary information related to the Company's investment in Tinuum Group and the related RC facilities as of December 31, 2020 and tons of RC produced and sold for the year ended December 31, 2020:

 | | | | Operating
 | # of RC Facilities | Not Operating | | | Invested | Retained
RC Facilities | 26 | | 3 | | | 23 | | (1) | —
RC tons produced and sold (000's) | | | | | 64,982 | | 693 | 

The following tables provide summary information of Tinuum Group's RC facilities as of December 31, 2019 and tons of RC produced and sold for the year ended December 31, 2019: 

 | | | | Operating
 | # of RC Facilities | Not Operating | | | Invested | Retained
Facilities | 26 | | 6 | | | 20 | | (1) | —
RC tons produced and sold (000's) | | | | | 66,481 | | 1,505 | 

(1) One RC facility was approximately 50% invested with an independent third party. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining approximate 50% was retained by Tinuum Group, the Company and another member of Tinuum Group. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Tinuum Group sold its interest in this RC facility. 
Competition
We believe Chem-Mod, LLC and licensees of Chem-Mod's technology are Tinuum Group's principal competitors. Competition in the RC market is based primarily on price, the number of tons of coal burned at the coal-fired electric generating units where the RC facilities are operating and the tax compliance facts associated with each RC facility. 
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in our RC products are comprised of non-bromine based halogens. 
Operations
Tinuum RC facilities are located at coal-fired power plants in the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services had operations in 16 states.
Advanced Purification Technologies
Given the downward trends in the coal-fired power generation market, the prices of competing power generation sources as well as our recognition of the unavailability of Section 45 tax credits for RC after 2021, during 2020 we executed on plans to expand our AC products and diversify into new markets. As a result, internal changes, including changes in operating structure and the method in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") allocates resources, resulted in the change in reportable segments. 
Products
Our AC and chemical products are used to purify coal-fired utilities, industrials, water treatment plants, and other markets. For the purification of air and gases, one of the uses of AC is to reduce mercury emissions and other air contaminants, specifically at coal-fired power generators and other industrial companies. Most of the North American coal-fired power generators installed equipment to control air pollutants, such as mercury, prior to or since the inception of the MATS. However, many power generators need consumable products on a recurring basis to chemically and physically capture mercury and other contaminants. AC has widely been adopted as the best available technology to capture mercury due to product efficiency and 
effectiveness and currently accounts for over 50% of the mercury control consumables North American market. We offer AC and other chemical products and work with customers as they develop and implement a compliance control strategy that utilizes the consumables solutions that fit with their unique operating and pollutions control configuration. 
For the purification of water, AC has been used in the treatment of drinking water, wastewater, contaminated soil and groundwater to absorb compounds causing unpleasant taste and odor and other contaminants. Both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants have deployed the use of AC in their treatment processes. Groundwater contamination has become a matter of increasing concern to federal and state governments as well as to the public, especially in the last 10 years. The U.S. AC market may see significant growth from water purification markets, especially if future regulations are passed controlling certain chemicals in drinking water. At present, individual states are primarily responsible for the protection of groundwater. 
Coal, as a fuel source for electricity generation, continues to be a significant source of power generation, although significantly decreased from when coal was the primary power generation source for the country. We see opportunities to continue to pursue diverse markets for our purification products outside of coal-fired power generation, including industrial applications, water treatment plants and other diverse markets. We expect the Supply Agreement with Cabot, as discussed above, does help expand our AC products into some of those diverse end-markets. 
Sales and Customers
Sales of consumables are primarily made by the Company’s employees to a range of customers, including coal-fired utilities, industrial companies, water treatment plants and other customers. Some of our sales of AC are made under annual requirements-based contracts or longer-term agreements. Revenues from our top three customers comprised approximately 28% of our consolidated consumables revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the APT operating results.
Competition
Our primary competitors for consumable products include Cabot (CBT), Calgon Carbon, a subsidiary of Tokyo Stock Exchange listed Kuraray Co., Ltd., Donau Carbon Company, Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (MEEC) and Nalco Holding Company, a subsidiary of Ecolab Inc. (ECL).
Raw Materials
The principal raw material we use in the manufacturing of AC is lignite coal, which is, in general, readily available and we believe we have an adequate supply through our ownership of the Five Forks Mine, which is operated for us by Demery Resources Company, LLC ("Demery"), a subsidiary of the North American Coal Company.
We purchase additives that are included in certain chemical products for resale to our customers through contracts with suppliers. The manufacturing of these consumable products is dependent upon certain discrete additives that are subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide the necessary additives needed to manufacture our products are limited. Supply agreements with these producers are generally renewed on an annual basis.
Operations
We own and operate the Red River plant that is located in Louisiana. We also lease a manufacturing and distribution facility located in Louisiana. Additionally, we have sales, product development and administrative operations located in Colorado. 
Research and Development Activities
We have conducted research and development directed towards product development related to the Supply Agreement and other markets. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred expenses of $1.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
Legislation and Environmental Regulations 
Our products and services, as well as Tinuum Group’s production and sale of RC, are for the reduction of pollutants and other contaminants. To the extent that legislation and regulation limit the amount of pollutants and other contaminants permitted, the need for our products increases. Below is a summary of the primary legislation and regulation that affects the market for our products.
U.S. Federal Mercury and Air Toxic Standards ("MATS") Affecting Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") final "MATS Rule" went into effect in April 2012. The EPA structured the MATS Rule as a MACT-based hazardous pollutant regulation applicable to coal and oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units ("EGU"), which generate electricity through steam turbines and have a capacity of 25 megawatts or greater, and provide for, among other provisions, control of mercury, control of acid gases such as hydrochloric acid ("HCl") and other Hazardous Air Pollutants ("HAPs"). Approximately 1,260 units were coal-fired EGUs when the rule was enacted. According to our estimates, the MATS Rule sets a limit that we believe requires the capture of up to 80-90% of the mercury in the coal burned in electric power generation boilers as measured at the exhaust stack outlet for most plants. The MACT standards are also known as National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"). Plants generally had four years to comply with the MATS Rule, and we estimate that, based on data reported to the EPA and conversations with plant operators, most plants were required to comply by April 2016 and implementation of the MATS Rule is now largely complete. We estimate that 42% of the coal-fired EGUs that were operating in December 2011 when the MATS Rule was finalized have been permanently shut down, leaving approximately 527 EGUs in operation at the end of 2019.
In April 2017, a review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit of a 2016 “supplemental finding” associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule conducted by the EPA was stayed at the request of the Trump Administration. The court case continues to be stayed indefinitely. In May 2020, the EPA reconsidered and withdrew its 2016 "supplemental finding" associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule. In this action, EPA found that it was not “appropriate and necessary” to regulate HAPs emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs. However, the EPA expressly stated that the reconsideration neither removed coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS rule, nor rescinded the MATS Rule, which has remained continuously in effect. ADES joined a number of parties in seeking review of this EPA action before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. President Biden identified EPA’s withdrawal of the supplemental finding as one of the actions to be reviewed for conformity with Biden Administration policy, and in February 2021, the Biden Administration moved that the pending judicial review of the supplemental finding withdrawal be held in abeyance. The Court has granted the administration’s motion, and this appeal also is now in abeyance. The MATS Rule remains in effect.
State Mercury and Air Toxics Regulations Affecting EGUs
In addition, certain states have their own mercury rules that are similar to or more stringent than the MATS Rule, and coal-fired electricity generating units in the U.S are subject to consent decrees that require the control of acid gases and particulate matter, in addition to mercury emissions. 
U.S. Federal Industrial Boiler MACT
In January 2013, the U.S. EPA issued the final set of adjustments to the MACT-based air toxics standards for industrial boilers, including mercury, particulate matter, and acid gas emission limits. Existing boilers typically had until January 31, 2017 to comply with the rule. On December 1, 2014, the EPA announced the reconsideration of the industrial boiler MACT ("IBMACT") and proposed amendments to the version published January 31, 2013, representing technical corrections and clarifications. The proposed amendments do not affect the applicability of the final rule.
The EPA estimated that approximately 600 coal-fired boilers will be affected by IBMACT, in industries such as pulp and paper. Our estimates, based on conversations with plant operators, suggest that most of the affected plants have or will either shut down or switch fuels to natural gas to comply with the regulation.
Effluent Limitation Guidelines
In 2015, the EPA set the first federal limits known as effluent limitation guidelines (“ELGs”) on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. The final rule requires, among other things, zero discharge for fly ash and bottom ash transport water, and limits on mercury, arsenic, selenium, and nitrate from flue gas desulfurization ("FGD") wastewater. In September 2017, the EPA finalized a rule that delayed the original compliance deadlines for certain wastewater streams from November 2018 to November 2020, with the possibility that plants would not need to comply until December 2023 with state approval. In April 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the EPA’s ELGs that apply to leachate wastewater and "legacy wastewater," and directed the EPA to revise the limits on the levels of toxic metals in those wastewater streams. In November 2019, the EPA proposed to revise the ELGs for bottom ash and FGD wastewater. The final rule, published in the Federal Register on October 13, 2020 and effective on December 14, 2020, does not directly regulate halogens. It does, however, propose to establish a voluntary incentives program for the removal of certain halides. Though 
under several (though not all) of the proposed treatment options that the EPA is considering, selenium in FGD wastewater would be regulated. Some halogens may impact the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment systems that are often used for the removal of selenium. 
Additional U.S. Legislation and Regulations
In 2015, the EPA finalized rules to reduce greenhouse gases ("GHGs") in the form of the Clean Power Plan ("CPP"), which established guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. Under the CPP, states were required to prepare "State Plans" to meet state targets based on emission reductions from affected sources. The CPP was challenged by multiple states in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("DC Circuit"). The CPP was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The DC Circuit held the CPP litigation in abeyance until April 28, 2017, and dismissed the case once the EPA replaced the CPP.
In July 2019, the EPA repealed the CPP and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule, which established guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. ACE also requires states to prepare State Plans and prescribes that they must be based on heat rate improvements at affected plants. Numerous states, power companies, and non-governmental organizations challenged the ACE rule in the D.C. Circuit, which vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021.
International Regulations
There are various international regulations related to mercury control. In Canada, the Canada-Wide Standard ("CWS") was initially implemented in 2010, with increasingly stringent limits through 2020 and with varying mercury emissions caps for each province. China and Germany both have limits for mercury emissions that are less stringent than U.S. limits and are typically met using co-benefits from other installed air pollution control equipment designed to control other pollutants. In May 2017, the EU ratified the Minimata Convention on Mercury, triggering mercury control regulations with implementation starting in 2021. Specific emissions limits are currently being developed guided by the best available technologies reference ("BREF") document for limiting stack emissions and liquid effluents from industrial processes. The BREF conclusions for large coal-fired electricity generating units were adopted by the European Commission in July 2017.
Based upon the existing and potential regulations, we believe the international market for mercury control products may expand in the coming years. We believe the EMEA Supply Agreement will help facilitate positioning our patent portfolio and existing commercial products in the EMEA region.
Mining Environmental and Reclamation Matters
Federal, state and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety and the environment, including the protection of air quality, water quality, wetlands, special status species of plants and animals, land uses, cultural and historic properties and other environmental resources identified during the permitting process. Reclamation is required during production and after mining has been completed. Materials used and generated by mining operations must also be managed according to applicable regulations and law. 
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 ("SMCRA"), establishes mining, environmental protection, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining. Mining operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals from the Office of Surface Mining (the "OSM"), or from the applicable state agency if the state agency has obtained regulatory primacy. A state agency may achieve primacy if the state regulatory agency develops a mining regulatory program that is no less stringent than the federal mining regulatory program under SMCRA. The Five Forks Mine operates in Louisiana, which has achieved primacy and issues permits in lieu of the OSM. The Marshall Mine operates in Texas, which has achieved primacy and issues permits in lieu of the OSM.
Mine operators are often required by federal and/or state laws, including SMCRA, to assure, usually through the use of surety bonds, payment of certain long‑term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers’ compensation costs, coal leases and other miscellaneous obligations. Although surety bonds are usually noncancelable during their term, many of these bonds are renewable on an annual basis and collateral requirements may change. As of December 31, 2020, we posted a surety bond of approximately $6.7 million for reclamation of the Five Forks Mine and $30.0 million for the reclamation of Marshall Mine.
Patents 
As of December 31, 2020, we held 71 U.S. patents and 15 international patents that were issued or allowed, 24 additional U.S. provisional patents or applications that were pending, and five international patent applications that were either pending or filed relating to different aspects of our technology. Our existing patents generally have terms of 20 years from the date of filing, with our next patents expiring beginning in 2021. We consider many of our patents and pending patents to be critical to the ongoing conduct of our business. 
Seasonality of Activities 
The sale of our consumable products and RC facility operation levels depend on the operations of the power generation units and industrial facilities to which the applicable consumables are provided and the location of the RC facilities, respectively. Power generation is weather dependent, with electricity and steam production varying in response to heating and cooling needs. Additionally, power generating units routinely schedule maintenance outages in the spring and/or fall depending upon the operation of the boilers. During the period in which an outage may occur, which may range from one week to over a month, no consumables are used and no RC is produced or sold, and our earnings and Tinuum's revenues may be correspondingly reduced. 
The sale of our AC products for water purification depends on demand from municipal water treatment facilities where these products are utilized. Depending on weather conditions and other environmental factors the summer months historically have the highest demand for PAC, as one of the major uses for PAC is for the treatment of taste and odor problems caused by increased degradation of organic contaminants and natural materials in water during the summer.
Safety, Health and Environment
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health, and environmental matters ("SH&E Regulations"). These SH&E Regulations include requirements to maintain and comply with various environmental permits related to the operation of many of our facilities, including mine health and safety laws required for continued operation of the Five Forks Mine.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 136 personnel, all of which were full-time employees; 35 employees were employed at our offices in Colorado and 101 employees were employed at our facilities in Louisiana.
