General
 Forrester Research, Inc. is a global independent research and advisory firm. We help leaders across technology, marketing, customer experience, product and sales functions use customer obsession to accelerate growth. Through Forrester’s proprietary research, consulting, and events, leaders from around the globe are empowered to be bold at work, navigate change, and put their customers at the center of their leadership, strategy, and operations. Our unique insights are grounded in annual surveys of more than 675,000 consumers, business leaders, and technology leaders worldwide, rigorous and objective research methodologies, over 45 million real-time feedback votes, and the shared wisdom of our clients. 
 We were incorporated in Massachusetts on July 7, 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware on February 16, 1996.
 Our Internet address is www.forrester.com. We make available free of charge, on or through the investor information section of our website, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
 Industry Background
 Enterprises struggle to keep up with digitally-savvy, empowered customers and maintain differentiation in a disruption-rich market. Technology changes and innovations occur at a rapid pace. Developing and executing on comprehensive and coordinated business strategies is challenging as consumers and businesses adopt new methods of buying and selling and markets grow increasingly dynamic. 
 Consequently, companies and the professionals we serve must rely on external sources of independent business advice and data spanning a variety of areas including but not limited to customer behavior, technology investments, business strategy, and functional disciplines. We believe there is a need for objective research, data, advisory, and related services that allow our clients to understand market dynamics, develop differentiated strategies, and execute in a complex, fast-moving market.
 Forrester’s Strategy 
 We believe that market dynamics — from empowered customers to the COVID-19 pandemic — have fundamentally changed business and technology. Executives and the companies they lead need to adapt to new challenges such as accelerating digital transformation or even pivoting to entirely new business models. Our research has shown that companies that center everything they do around the customer, what we call customer-obsessed firms, grow faster and are more profitable. As a result, customer obsession is the foundation of our strategy and our research. Our unique strategy, products, and services are designed to help enterprises become customer-obsessed in service of differentiated customer experiences, growth, and profit. 
 In furtherance of our strategy, we: 1) help our clients understand what is changing in their markets and how their customers and technology are changing; 2) provide guidance on how clients should build their strategies to achieve competitive advantage; 3) gather real-time data to enable our clients to immediately improve their customer experience; and 4) provide specific, actionable guidance for how to execute on those strategies quickly and decisively. Our broad set of products, services, and engagement opportunities are designed to help our clients shorten the distance between a bold vision and superior execution.
 3


Importantly, the three areas where we work with our clients — vision, strategy, and execution — are interrelated and widespread in the large organizations that we serve. This creates opportunities to sell add-on products and services to our existing clients. In addition, we believe our go-to-market strategy is unique, increasing our competitive differentiation.
 Products and Services
 We offer our clients a selection of products, services, and engagement opportunities, which fall into three main categories: Research, Consulting, and Events. These solutions help our clients to:

• | Understand trends in consumer and business buyer behavior and how to capitalize on those trends.

Research
 Our primary Research products and services include Forrester Research and SiriusDecisions® Research (our core research offerings), Connect (our peer offerings), and Analytics.
 Forrester Research and SiriusDecisions Research
 Forrester’s published research and tools serve as the foundation for how we address our clients’ and prospects’ opportunities and challenges. We believe that our Research enables clients to do three things: 1) clarify and predict market dynamics to set a bold vision for their firm; 2) build customer-obsessed strategies to achieve competitive advantage; and 3) execute effectively to drive revenue and profit. We offer two distinct Research products, Forrester Research and SiriusDecisions Research.
 Our primary subscription research product, Forrester Research, provides clients with access to our core research designed to expand our clients’ understanding of external trends and tools to inform their strategic decision-making. We deepen clients’ understanding of market, customer, and technology trends through data-driven reports, predictions, and forecasts. Our Playbooks offer a set of integrated reports and tools to tackle critical business initiatives. They provide in-depth advice designed to build detailed strategies for these initiatives, including assessments, roadmaps, and business cases, as well as organizational, process, and technology guidance.  
 Forrester Research also includes a body of evaluative research. The Forrester Tech Tide™ helps clients understand what technology categories to invest in and when. Our Now Tech reports help clients identify and segment technology players in established categories. And the Forrester Wave™ allows clients to compare individual products and develop a custom shortlist based on their unique requirements. The Forrester Wave provides a detailed analysis of vendors’ technologies and services in various markets based on transparent, fully accessible criteria, and measurement of characteristics. In the emerging technology space, our New Tech and New Wave reports help clients learn about new game-changing technologies and companies to help customers drive growth and support long-term strategies.
 SiriusDecisions Research delivers operational intelligence and fact-based insight to functional marketing, sales, and product leaders of business-to-business (“B2B”) organizations and their teams. Research types include best-practice models and frameworks to structure functional operations, insights from more than 30 B2B buyer personas, event presentations, webinars, role profiles, select best practices implemented by peers, and the interactive, web-based SiriusTools® to aid in planning, execution, and measurement.

SiriusDecisions Research is created based on client priorities, which we believe are the most important business opportunities and critical challenges B2B marketing, sales and product leaders are trying to solve. SiriusDecisions Command Center® offers performance benchmarking metrics in a self-service platform to aid sales, marketing, and product leaders in planning, uncovering new opportunities, and making business cases.

• | FeedbackNow. As customers become more powerful, we believe that companies must have the ability to monitor and improve their experience in real time. To this end, we offer FeedbackNow, a real-time customer experience solution composed of: 1) multiple data inputs; 2) an artificial intelligence (“AI”)-assisted analytics engine, or “brain”; and 3) multiple output methods. FeedbackNow is currently employing physical buttons as the primary input source. It is installed widely in Europe and the U.S. – primarily in large airports, arenas, retail, financial services locations and health care sites – and we are processing hundreds of thousands of “votes” per day. We are expanding the capabilities of FeedbackNow to encompass a range of digital inputs and outputs. In addition, we are incorporating our proprietary customer experience data, drivers, and algorithms into the system brain to increase the precision and efficacy of feedback for our clients. In 2020, we introduced several innovations designed to assist our customers with unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. These included touchless devices, anti-microbial coatings, solutions for monitoring the number of customers within an establishment, and various custom button options.

Consulting
 Our Consulting products include consulting projects and advisory services and leverage our Research, Technographics, and CX Index data, as well as our proprietary consulting frameworks, to deliver focused insights and recommendations that assist clients with their challenges in developing and executing technology and business strategy, including customer experience, digital strategy, marketing, informing critical decisions, and reducing business risk. Our Consulting products help clients with challenges addressed in our published research, such as leading customer experience transformations, digital business transformation, technology transformations and modernization, and aligning sales, marketing, and product management. We help business and technology professionals conduct maturity assessments, prioritize best practices, develop strategies, build business cases, select technology vendors, and structure organizations. We help marketing professionals at technology vendors develop content marketing strategies, create content marketing collateral, and develop sales tools. We have a dedicated consulting organization to provide professional services to our clients, utilizing our Forrester solutions framework and best in class consulting techniques and content development tools, allowing our analysts to spend additional time on writing research and providing shorter-term advisory services (such as speeches and advisory days).
Events
 We host multiple events in various locations in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region throughout the year. Events bring together executives and other participants serving or interested in the particular subject matter or professional role(s) on which an event focuses. Event participants come together to network with their peers, meet with Forrester analysts, and hear business leaders discuss business and technology issues of interest or significance to the professionals in attendance. Forrester Events focus on business imperatives of significant interest to our clients, including marketing, sales and product leadership, customer experience, privacy and security, new technology and innovation, and data strategies and insights.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to convert our events to fully paid, live virtual experiences. This format allowed us to offer sessions on demand, leading to higher attendee engagement. The dynamic nature of the platform also enabled us to facilitate more networking opportunities with sponsors and Forrester analysts and to host and provide more content to attendees than in a traditional, in-person event. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our products and services through our direct sales force in various locations in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Our sales organization is organized into groups based on client size, geography, and market potential. Our Premier groups focus on our largest vendor and end user clients across the globe while our Core group focuses on small to mid-sized vendor and end user clients. Our European and Asia Pacific groups focus on both end user and vendor clients in their respective geographies.  Our International Business Development group sells our products and services through independent sales representatives in select international locations. We also have groups dedicated to event sales and FeedbackNow sales. We employed 701 sales personnel as of December 31, 2020 compared to 698 sales personnel employed as of December 31, 2019. We also sell select Research products directly online through our website.
 We utilize a customer engagement model where we provide different sales engagement and support levels for clients and prospects in our Premier and Core groups. We believe that this positions us in a manner to improve client and dollar retention and enrichment and accelerate growth.
 Our marketing activities are designed to enhance the Forrester brand, differentiate and promote Forrester products and services, improve the client experience, and drive growth. We achieve these outcomes by combining the value of analytics, content, social media, public relations, creative, and field marketing, delivering multi-channel campaigns, Forrester events, and high-quality digital experiences.
 As of December 31, 2020, our products and services were delivered to more than 2,600 client companies. No single client company accounted for more than 3% of our 2020 revenues.
 Pricing and Contracts
 We report our revenue from client contracts in three categories of revenue: (1) research, (2) consulting, and (3) events. We classify revenue from subscriptions to, and licenses of, our Research, Connect, and Analytics products and services as research revenue. We classify revenue from Consulting, including custom Analytics projects, as consulting revenue. We classify revenue from tickets to and sponsorships of Events as events revenue.
 Contract pricing for annual subscription-based products is principally a function of the number of licensed users at the client. Pricing of contracts is a fixed fee for the consulting project or shorter-term advisory service. We periodically review and increase the list prices for our products and services.
 We track the agreement value of contracts to purchase our services as a significant business indicator. We calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all such contracts in force at a given time (excluding contracts that consist solely of Consulting products and the value of Events sponsorships included in all contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized. Agreement value decreased 4% to $345.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $358.0 million at December 31, 2019.
 Competition
 We compete principally in the market for research and advisory services, with an emphasis on customer behavior, customer experience, and the deployment of technology to win, serve and retain customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we participate in include:

• | the ability to offer products and services that meet the changing needs of organizations and their executives for research, data, and advisory services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comprehensive global data and insights on customer behavior;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | independent analysis and opinions;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the ability to render our services in digital forms;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | the pricing and packaging of our products and services; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer service, including the quality of professional interactions with our clients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8



We believe we compete favorably on these factors due to:
  
• | our differentiated customer-obsessed strategy and portfolio of complementary Forrester and SiriusDecisions products and services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our focus on serving the needs of key functions at client organizations, including technology, marketing, customer experience, sales, and product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our research methodology;
--+--------------------------


• | our experience with and focus on emerging technologies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | our history of providing research and executable advice on the impact of technology on business; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our growing ability to deploy digital products.
--+------------------------------------------------

 Our principal direct competitors include other independent providers of research and advisory services, such as Gartner, as well as marketing agencies, general business consulting firms, survey-based general market research firms, providers of peer networking services, and digital media measurement services. In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies. We also face competition from free sources of information available on the Internet, such as Google. Our indirect competitors could choose to compete directly against us in the future. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into certain segments of our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more of these market segments. Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed a total of 1,798 persons, including 704 Research, Connect, Analytics, Consulting and Events staff and 701 sales personnel. Of these employees, 1,343 were in the United States and Canada; 267 in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and 188 in the Asia Pacific region.
 Customer obsession is at the heart of Forrester’s research, strategy, and culture. Our culture emphasizes certain key values — including client, courage, collaboration, integrity, and quality — that we believe are critical to deliver Forrester’s unique value proposition of helping business and technology leaders use customer obsession to drive growth. We celebrate and enrich the Forrester culture through training and frequent recognition of achievements. New employees participate in a three-day training process that focuses on our customer-obsessed strategy, our products and services, corporate culture, values, and goals. In addition, throughout the year we offer our employees a variety of training courses including our Leadership Development Program and topics focused on culture, resilience, and change.
 Attracting, retaining, and developing the best and brightest talent around the globe is critical to the ongoing success of our company. To this end, we focus on attracting, hiring, and the inclusion of all backgrounds and perspectives, with the goals of improving employee retention and engagement, strengthening the quality of our research, and improving client retention and customer experience. We field regular surveys to all of our employees to measure our progress against our goals. In addition, we have established a Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”) Council and regional D&I Networks to help guide us in these efforts.
