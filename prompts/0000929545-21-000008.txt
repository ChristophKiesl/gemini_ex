ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 ﻿
 References to the “Company”, “we,” “our,” and “us,” refer to Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc., including, as the context requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The descriptions of the Company in this Part I are as of the filing of this Form 10-K on March 18, 2021.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc. was incorporated in Virginia on August 23, 1994 and was reincorporated in Maryland on November 19, 2014. Our common stock began trading on October 30, 1996 and today trades under the symbol “CDOR” on the NYSE American stock exchange.
 ﻿
 The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes that specializes in the investment and ownership of high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned 15 hotels, representing 1,908 rooms, in eight states.
 ﻿
 We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, in which our hotel properties are owned by our operating partnership, Condor Hospitality Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries (the “operating partnership”), for which we serve as general partner. As of December 31, 2020, we owned an approximate 99.9% ownership interest in the operating partnership.  In the future, the operating partnership may issue limited partnership interests to third parties from time to time in connection with our acquisition of hotel properties or the raising of capital.  
 ﻿
 In order for the income from our hotel property investments to constitute “rents from real properties” for purposes of the gross income tests required by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for REIT qualification, the income we earn cannot be derived from the operation of any of our hotels.  Therefore, the operating partnership and its subsidiaries lease our hotel properties to the Company’s wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary, TRS Leasing, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“the TRS”). The TRS in turn engages third-party eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels. Our independent management companies are not affiliated with us or our management team. The operating partnership, the TRS, and their respective subsidiaries are consolidated into the Company’s financial statements.

﻿
 We are engaged primarily in the business of owning equity interests in hotel properties and therefore our business is disclosed as one reportable segment.  See the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information required in this Item 1.
 ﻿
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a global pandemic and the virus has continued to spread throughout the United States and the world. As a result of this pandemic and subsequent government mandates and health official recommendations, hotel demand has been significantly reduced. See further discussion in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 ﻿
 Termination and Settlement of Agreement and Plan of Merger 
 ﻿
 On September 18, 2020, the Company terminated the Agreement and Plan and Merger, dated July 19, 2019, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Condor Hospitality Limited Partnership (together with the Company, the “Company Parties”), NHT Operating Partnership, LLC (“Parent”), NHT REIT Merger Sub, LLC (“Merger Sub”) and NHT Operating Partnership II, LLC (“Merger OP”, and together with Parent and Merger Sub, the “Parent Parties”).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company was to be acquired by Parent in a merger transaction. 
 ﻿
 On October 15, 2020, the Company announced that the Company Parties entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with NexPoint Advisors L.P. (“NexPoint Advisors”), NexPoint Hospitality Trust (TSVX: NHT) (“NHT”), and Parent Parties (NexPoint Advisors, NHT and Parent Parties collectively, the “NHT Parties”), following the Company’s previously announced termination of the Merger Agreement. 
 ﻿
 Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the NHT Parties made three payments to the Company totaling $7.0 million.  All payments were received during the fourth quarter of 2020 and recorded as a reduction of strategic alternatives expense, net upon receipt. Upon timely payment of all of the Settlement Payments, the NHT Parties’ settlement liability was satisfied in full.  In exchange for these payment obligations, the NHT Parties have been released from all claims or liabilities relating to the Merger Agreement.  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company Parties also have been released from all claims or liabilities relating to the Merger Agreement. 
 ﻿
 Additionally, during the second quarter of 2020, the Company received nonrefundable cash of $0.5 million from NHT Parties in connection with the then ongoing discussions concerning potential adjustments to restructure the transaction, which, in the event a transaction occurs, was to be credited against the acquisition purchase price.  This deposit was recognized as a reduction of strategic alternatives expense, net upon the termination of the Merger Agreement on September 18, 2020.

Core Strategies
 ﻿
 Acquisition Strategy
 ﻿
 The objective of our acquisition strategy is to enable us to acquire assets that meet our target property characteristics and investment criteria at attractive valuations. We believe that our existing relationships with owners, operators, and developers of select-service hotels will provide us with access to certain off-market acquisition opportunities ahead of other real estate investors.  Typically, off-market transactions lead to more attractive valuation outcomes.  Our organizational documents do not limit the types of investments we can make; however, our intent is to execute the acquisition strategy as detailed herein. 
     We believe our target property characteristics and investment criteria, coupled with our ability to source off-market transactions, differentiates us from our peers and will enable us to achieve our mission to obtain attractive returns to our shareholders.
 ﻿
 Hotels purchased in and since 2012 are referred to throughout as “new investment platform” properties while properties owned prior to 2012 are referred to as “legacy” properties. The Company’s last remaining legacy property was sold in 2019.
 ﻿
 Target Property Characteristics
 ﻿
 Our target properties are high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels located primarily in the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs”), with a focus on the top 21 – 60 MSAs.  From time to time, we may acquire assets outside these target MSAs if we are able to acquire the asset at an attractive valuation and have confidence in the value proposition of the property.  If within a top 25 MSA, the asset will typically be located within an attractive sub- market of the larger MSA.  The hotels we will look to acquire will be franchised under premium flags by brands such as Hilton, Marriott, IHG, and Hyatt and operated by third-party management companies. 
 ﻿
 Investment Criteria
 ﻿
 We perform thorough due diligence and utilize extensive research to evaluate any target market or property.  This due diligence and research may include, but is not limited to, analyzing the long-term economic outlook of an MSA, reviewing trends in local lodging demand and supply, assessing property condition and required capital investment, and understanding historical property financial performance.  Specific investment criteria for hotels we are looking to acquire may include but are not limited to hotels that: 
· | operate under leading premium franchise brands and possess key attributes such as building design and décor that is consistent with current generation brand standards;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are located within the top 100 MSAs, in close proximity to multiple demand drivers, including large corporations, regional hospitals, regional business hubs, recreational travel destinations, significant retail centers, and military installations, among others;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are located within markets that have favorable economic, job growth, and demographic factors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have illustrated an ability to generate stabilized and dependable revenue and net operating income;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | were constructed less than ten years prior to our acquisition or have been recently significantly renovated to current brand standards, and have significant time (generally ten or more years) remaining on the existing franchise license; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have some value-added growth potential through operating efficiencies, institutional asset management, repositioning, renovations, or rebranding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | can be acquired at a discount to replacement cost; and/or
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | can be acquired in off-market transactions.
--+--------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Select-service hotels typically generate most of their revenue from room rentals, have limited food and beverage outlets, contain less meeting space, and require fewer employees than traditional full-service hotels. We believe premium-branded upper-midscale and upscale select-service hotels have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to other types of hotels due to their ability to achieve Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) levels at or close to those achieved by traditional full-service hotels while achieving higher profit margins due to their more efficient operating model and less volatile cash flows.

Disposition Strategy
 ﻿
 In 2019 we completed an approximate ten year process of transitioning our portfolio from economy hotels to high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels.  In order to achieve this objective, we have focused on disposing of legacy assets that do not meet the property characteristics and investment criteria discussed above.  Since January 1, 2009, we have sold 123 hotels, of which 55 have been sold since January 1, 2015.  The value unlocked from asset sales has been redeployed into newer, higher-quality assets meeting the acquisition strategy discussed above.  Just as we carefully evaluate the hotels we plan to acquire, our asset management team has evaluated the timing and composition of the legacy hotels to be disposed of in a manner we believe will maximize returns for our shareholders.  
     Additionally, from time to time, we may undertake the sale of one or more hotels that meet the property characteristics and investment criteria discussed above.  These disposition decisions are the result of a thorough analysis and typically in response to changes in market conditions, our current or projected return on our investment in the hotel, or other factors which we deem relevant to the disposition decision.
 ﻿
 Asset Management Strategy
 ﻿
 Through collaboration with our third-party operators, we seek to maximize value to our shareholders through improvements to our existing hotels’ operating results.  We work toward this goal by constantly monitoring the performance of each individual hotel and identifying opportunities for value-enhancement through intensive asset management strategies.  We will make recommendations to our third-party operators in all aspects of our hotels operations, including revenue management, physical design, guest experience, market positioning, and overall property strategy.  Fundamentally, all strategies are focused on growing the revenue of a hotel, controlling expenses, and/or maximizing the guest experience to drive returns. 
      We work with our third-party operators to develop short-term and long-term capital investment plans that are focused on generating positive returns for our shareholders.  The capital improvements may involve investments in expansions, additions, renovations, technology upgrades, and/or energy efficiency improvements. 
      Additionally, from time to time, we may come to the conclusion that a particular asset may provide greater returns to our shareholders after an extensive repositioning of the asset in the market.  In these instances, capital investment in a greater amount than typical for an asset may be required to achieve the desired repositioning.  These decisions will be made after a thorough analysis of the property, market conditions, and the potential for a positive return on investment that exceeds our investment hurdle rates. 
 ﻿
 Financing Strategy
 ﻿
 Our financing strategy is to seek to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our shareholders.  We intend to finance our long-term growth with equity capital raises and debt financings that have staggered maturities.  From time to time, when purchasing hotel properties, we may issue limited partnership interests in our operating partnership to third parties as full or partial consideration to sellers.  Currently, our debt includes a revolving line of credit secured by certain hotels and mortgages secured by our hotel properties.  In the future we plan on using the revolving credit facility, term loans, equity issuances, and mortgage debt financings to fund future acquisitions as well as for property redevelopments, return on investment initiatives, and working capital requirements. 
 ﻿
 Since we are structured as an UPREIT, we may seek to issue limited partnership interest of our operating partnership for raising capital, or when acquiring hotel assets as full or partial consideration to sellers who may desire to take advantage of tax deferral on the sale of a hotel or participate in the income, and potential value appreciation, of our common stock.
 ﻿
 Business Partners
 ﻿
 Franchise Partners
 ﻿
 We believe that in order to achieve our mission we must partner with the right franchisors of quality brands in our target segments.  To this end, we have built strong relationships with many of who we believe are the leading franchisors of the strongest brands in the segments we target, including Hilton, Marriott, IHG, and Hyatt.  The franchisors provide a variety of benefits and value which include national advertising, marketing programs to 

 
5

 
increase brand awareness, personnel training, and centralized reservation systems.  We are constantly monitoring and evaluating the performance of these franchisors and their respective brands so that, when necessary, we can adapt our franchise partner strategy to maximize returns to our shareholders. 
 ﻿
 Under our franchise agreements, we are required to pay franchise fees generally between 3.3% and 5.5% of room revenue, plus additional fees for marketing, central reservation systems, and other franchisor programs and services that amount to between 2.5% and 6.0% of room revenue.  The franchise agreements typically have 10 to 25 year terms although certain agreements may be terminated by either party on certain anniversary dates specified in the agreements.  Further, each agreement provides for early termination fees in the event the agreement is terminated before the stated term.    ﻿
 Our 15 hotels owned at December 31, 2020 operate under the following national and independent brands:

  ﻿
 The franchisor of two of our hotels advised us in 2019 that both of the hotels had dropped below the required level for guest satisfaction surveys, and that if the hotels do not achieve compliance, it reserves the right to elect to terminate the relevant franchise agreements.  While the Company believes that it has corrected all deficiencies, the franchisor has informed us that they are not reassessing the accountability status of any properties until at the earliest July 2021.
 ﻿
 Hotel Management Company Partners
 ﻿
 As a REIT, we are not permitted to directly operate any of our hotels.  We partner closely with some of who we believe are the leading hotel management companies in order to operate our hotels with the ultimate objective of improving same-store hotel performance throughout our portfolio.  Each management agreement provides for a set term and is subject to early termination upon the occurrence of defaults and certain other events.  As required under the REIT qualification rules, each manager must qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” during the term of the management agreement.
 ﻿
 Our 15 hotels owned at December 31, 2020 are operated by the following third-party management companies:
 ﻿
 ﻿

﻿ | | 
----------------------------------------+------------------+----------------
Management Company | Number of Hotels | Number of Rooms

Total | 15 | 1,908 

  ﻿
 Seasonality of Hotel Business
 ﻿
 Historically, as a result of the geographic areas in which we operate, the operations of our hotels have been seasonal in nature.  Generally, occupancy rates, revenue, and operating income have been greater in the second and third quarters of the calendar year than in the first and fourth quarters, with the exception of our hotels located in Florida,

which experience peak demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year.  The historical trend has been disrupted as a result of COVID-19.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, the first quarter of the year had higher revenue, operating income, and cash flow as hotel demand declined significantly as a result of COVID-19 beginning in March 2020.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The hotel industry is highly competitive.  Each of our hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties.  The number of competitive hotel properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on revenue, occupancy, and the average daily room rate of our hotels or of hotel properties acquired in the future, and thus our financial results.
 ﻿
 We may compete for investment opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than us.  These entities generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. Competition in general may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities for us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  
 ﻿
 Tax Status
 ﻿
 The Company qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), as amended.  In general, under such Code provisions, a trust which has made the required election and, in the taxable year, meets certain requirements and distributes to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of the income currently distributed to shareholders.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will be unable to re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT, unless we satisfy certain relief provisions.  Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income.  Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the TRS, which is taxed as a C-Corporation, is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes.  
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2020, the Company had six employees.  The staff at our hotels are employed by our third-party hotel managers.
