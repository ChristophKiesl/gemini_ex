ITEM 1.    Business
General
We are one of North America's largest producers of advanced biofuels focused on providing cleaner, lower carbon transportation fuels. We utilize a nationwide production, distribution and logistics system as part of an integrated value chain model designed to convert natural fats, oils and greases into advanced biofuels. During 2021, we sold 621 million total gallons of fuel (including biofuel and petroleum fuel purchased from third parties for resale) and generated revenues of over $3 billion. We believe our fully integrated approach, which includes acquiring feedstock, operating biorefineries, distributing fuel through a network of terminals, and managing biorefinery facility construction and upgrades, positions us to serve the growing market for cleaner transportation fuels. 
In addition to our acquisition of Keck Energy in September 2018, we opened our first REG branded fueling station in July 2019 adjacent to our biorefinery in Seneca, Illinois to serve a variety of customers from trucking fleets to local diesel vehicle owners. In June 2020, we entered into an agreement with a third party pursuant to which it agreed to exclusively sell REG branded fuels at certain of its cardlock locations. In October 2021, we entered into a long-term agreement with GoodFuels, a leading supplier of sustainable marine biofuels and global producer and supplier of renewable fuels, for the supply and development of sustainable marine biofuel solutions for the global shipping industry. In November 2021, we entered into a partnership with Canadian Northern Railway to test bio and RD blends for their locomotive fleet. In December 2021, we acquired Amber Resources, a California-based distributor of bio-based diesel, petroleum diesel and lubricants. This acquisition enables us to access a larger network of end customers. These are part of our downstream strategy, which is focused on three important objectives: margin expansion across the value chain, including by directing production to the most profitable geographies; realization of higher biodiesel values through blends of biodiesel into petroleum and RD; and increased demand for our biodiesel via sales of B100 to end customers. 
In October 2020, we announced our plan to expand the effective capacity of our Geismar, Louisiana biorefinery. The Geismar project involves both an improvement project for the existing operating at the site, as well as the capacity expansion. The Geismar project is expected to take total annual site production from 90 million to 340 million gallons, enhance existing operations and improve operational reliability and logistics. The expansion is expected to be mechanically complete in 2023 with full operations in early 2024. We have received all required permits to proceed with construction and officially broke ground to start the construction process in the fourth quarter of 2021. The capital cost for the Geismar project is estimated to be $950 million and is funded with a combination of cash on hand, marketable securities, borrowings under our credit facilities, and proceeds from our public offering of common stock that closed March 19, 2021 and proceeds from our issuance of Green Notes that closed on May 20, 2021, as discussed below. In addition, in connection with the expansion we have entered into a long-term marine terminal lease for terminal and logistics services that will require a separate capital outlay. We have also agreed to construction contracts for large parts of the work associated with the improvements and expansion. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to complete this project in a timely manner or increase the capacity of our biorefinery at Geismar, Louisiana on time, at our estimated budget, or at all. The improvements and expansion are subject to a number of conditions and risks.
On March 19, 2021, we completed an equity offering pursuant to which we sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock to various underwriters at a price of $67.00 per share before underwriting discounts and commissions. The net proceeds from the offering were $365.3 million. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of our existing indebtedness and the funding of capital expenditures, including capital expenditures related to the Geismar project.
On May 20, 2021, we completed the sale and issuance of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Secured Green Note due 2028. We recorded $14.6 million in legal, professional and underwriting fees related to the issuance of the Green Notes. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for capital expenditures related to the Geismar project.
We believe that the execution of these strategies will enable us to expand our margins, diversify sources of profitability, manage our business through varying market conditions, and increase shareholder value. To help promote these strategies in an environmentally and socially responsible manner, we have integrated environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices into our business objectives. The process of implementing these ESG practices into our business was collaborative and involved our employees in an effort to maintain our values of safety, integrity, humanity, and driving results the REG way, which seeks to allow us to create a cleaner world and reduce our carbon footprint now and for the future.
Plant Network and Products
1


In September 2021, we announced the closure of the Houston, Texas biorefinery. Production at this facility ceased in November 2021. We currently own and operate a network of 11 biorefineries. Nine biorefineries are located in the United States and two in Germany. Ten biorefineries produce biodiesel and one produces RD. Our eleven bio-based diesel production facilities have an aggregate nameplate production capacity of 470 million gallons per year ("mmgy"). 
We own and operate the following facilities in North America and internationally:

The nameplate capacity listed above is based on original plant design.
Effective capacity represents the maximum average throughput that satisfies certain defined technical constraints.
REG owns this plant and related property and equipment.
This facility produces RD, naphtha, and liquid petroleum gas.
We announced the closure of this facility in September 2021 and production ceased in November 2021.
We maintain a testing laboratory at our corporate headquarters in Ames, Iowa, for testing various feedstocks for conversion into bio-based diesel and various new manufacturing processes to produce bio-based diesel. We also have a regional office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focused on maintaining and developing advanced biofuel technologies. In 2021, we partnered with Iowa State University to create a hydrotreater pilot plant to understand how various biomass feedstocks can play a role in the production of renewable fuels with a specific focus on RD. The plant's research will support our Geismar RD plant by helping to evaluate new low-carbon feedstocks and optimize production of RD and sustainable aviation fuel. In December 2021, we acquired Amber Resources, one of the leading fuel distributors in Southern California. This acquisition does not include real property, but includes leased locations to deliver fuel to end customers, further advancing our downstream strategy.
We produce RD at our Geismar, Louisiana facility. RD generally carries a premium price compared to biodiesel as a result of a variety of factors including the ability to blend it with petroleum diesel seamlessly, better cold weather performance, and because it generates more Renewable Identification Numbers ("RINs") on a per gallon basis. We announced in October 2020 our improvement and expansion of our Geismar, Louisiana facility which is expected to expand the effective capacity of the facility to 340 million gallons annually. We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to further our ability to leverage our RD technology and expand RD production to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation fuels.
Our products include biodiesel and RD produced at our facilities or from third parties, including RINs and LCFS credits, transportation, storage and insurance costs to the extent paid for by our customers; petroleum-based heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel, or ULSD, acquired from third parties, along with these petroleum-based products further blended with bio-based diesel; glycerin, and other co-products of the bio-based diesel production process. We believe our biodiesel and RD products further our ESG mission to create sustainable, clean energy, and creating value for society, ecosystem, employees, customers, and shareholders. In addition, our products include operations management services that we provide for bio-based diesel production facilities, typically based on production rates of the managed facility; and services performed by us in our role as general contractor and construction manager for upgrades and repairs to our bio-based diesel production facilities.
Our Feedstocks and Other Inputs
We are a lower carbon bio-based diesel producer. We primarily produce our bio-based diesel from a wide variety of low carbon feedstocks, including distillers corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat. We also produce bio-based diesel from virgin vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil, which tend to be higher in price. We believe our ability to process a wide variety of feedstocks in most of our facilities provides us with a cost advantage over many bio-based diesel producers, particularly those relying primarily on higher cost virgin vegetable oils.
We can adjust our processing in most of our facilities to accommodate different feedstocks and feedstock mixes. Our ability to use a wide range of feedstocks gives us a feedstock cost advantage over many other producers because we have the flexibility to respond to changes in feedstock pricing. In 2021, approximately 78% of our total feedstock usage was distillers corn oil, used cooking oil or rendered animal fat feedstock. The remaining approximately 22% consisted of refined vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil. 
We source our feedstocks from numerous vendors both domestically and internationally in quantities ranging from truckload to railcar to marine vessel. There is no established futures market for the low carbon feedstocks that we utilize. Distillers corn oil is typically purchased on fixed priced contracts in forward positions of one to three months and occasionally longer. We generally purchase used cooking oil and rendered animal fats on one to four week forward positions using fixed pricing or an indexed price compared to a published index such as USDA reports or recognized industry price reports such as The Jacobsen. Soybean and canola oils can be purchased on a spot or forward contract basis from several suppliers and pricing for these vegetable oils is compared to the broadly traded Soybean Oil Futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
From time to time, we work with developers of next generation feedstocks, such as algae and camelina, to assist them in bringing these new feedstocks to market. We have converted several of these feedstocks, as well as other second generation feedstocks, into high quality bio-based diesel in our laboratory and production facilities. We believe we are well positioned to incorporate many new feedstocks into our production process as they become commercially available.
We source methanol and chemical catalysts used in our production process such as sodium methylate and hydrochloric acid, under fixed-price contracts and formula-indexed contracts based upon competitive bidding. These sourcing contracts typically last from three months to five years. The price of methanol is indexed to the monthly reported published price. We also enter into a long-term supply agreement with a supplier to source hydrogen necessary for our RD production. 
Risk Management
The prices for feedstocks and bio-based diesel, including the value associated with government incentives, can be volatile and are not always closely correlated. Low carbon feedstocks are particularly difficult to risk manage given that such feedstocks are not traded in any public futures market. To manage feedstock and bio-based diesel price risks, we utilize forward contracting, hedging and other risk management strategies, including the use of futures, swaps, options and over-the-counter products.
In establishing our risk management strategies, we draw from our own in-house risk management expertise and consult with industry experts. We utilize research conducted by outside firms to provide additional market information and risk management strategies. We believe combining these sources of knowledge, experience and expertise expands our view of the fluctuating commodity markets for raw materials and energy to improve our risk management strategies.
Distribution
We have established a national distribution system to supply bio-based diesel throughout the United States. Each of our bio-based diesel facilities is equipped with an on-site rail loading system, a truck loading system, or both. Our Seneca biorefinery near the Illinois River has direct barge access for supplying customers using the inland waterways system. Our Grays Harbor biorefinery has deep-water capability for PANAMAX class vessels. We also manage some customers’ bio-based diesel storage tanks and replenishment process. Our distribution performance for 2021 in North America is depicted below.
Not pictured above are 8 fuel distribution locations including 3 cardlock locations, acquired as part of the Amber Resources acquisition, located in Southern California.
In addition to our U.S. operations noted above, we have established an international distribution system to supply bio-based diesel throughout Europe. Our products that are produced in Europe and in the United States are distributed to European customers using sea vessels, barges and trucks. Our Emden biorefinery has deep-water capabilities and can load vessels, barges and trucks. Our Oeding biorefinery can only load and unload trucks. We also have storage facilities in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region, which allows us to distribute our products efficiently. 
As of December 31, 2021, we leased over 1,525 railcars for transportation and leased bio-based diesel storage tanks in 47 terminals in North America and two terminals internationally. In general, the terminals in North America where we lease our bio-based diesel storage tanks are largely chemical product and petroleum fuel terminals so that fuel distributors and other bio-based diesel customers can create a bio-based diesel blend at the terminal before further distribution. Terminal contracts typically have one-to three-year terms and are generally renewable subject to certain terms and conditions. During 2021, REG sold products in 44 states and D.C. in the United States, six Canadian Provinces, and nineteen other countries around the world.
We sell heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD") at terminals throughout the northeastern United States. We sell additional biofuel blends at terminal locations in the Midwest, West Coast and Texas. We continue to look for terminal expansion and optimization opportunities across North America.
Government Programs Favoring Bio-Based Diesel Production and Use
The bio-based diesel industry benefits from numerous federal and state government programs.
Renewable Fuel Standard
Bio-based diesel has historically been more expensive to produce than petroleum-based diesel. The bio-based diesel industry's growth has largely been the result of federal and state programs that require or incentivize production and use of bio-based diesel, which allows bio-based diesel to be priced competitively with petroleum-based diesel.
The RFS2 bio-based diesel requirement became effective in 2010, requiring for the first time that a certain percentage of the gasoline and diesel fuel consumed in the United States be made from renewable sources. The bio-based diesel requirement can be satisfied by two primary fuels, biodiesel and RD. Required volumes under the RFS2 program, referred to as the renewable volume obligation ("RVO"), are determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. The final and proposed RVO targets for the bio-based diesel and advanced biofuels volumes for the years 2018 to 2022, respectively, as set by the EPA are as follows:

 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 
Bio-based diesel | 2.10 billion gallons | 2.10 billion gallons | 2.43 billion gallons | 2.43 billion gallons | 2.76 billion gallons**
Total advanced biofuels | 4.29 billion RINs* | 4.92 billion RINs* | 4.63 billion RINs*, ** | 5.20 billion RINs*, ** | 5.77 billion RINs*, **

*Ethanol equivalent gallons
** Proposed
The bio-based diesel requirement is one of four separate renewable fuel requirements under RFS2. The RFS2 requirements are based on two primary categories and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel, which is primarily satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two subcategories, cellulosic biofuel, to be satisfied by newly developed cellulosic biofuels, such as ethanol made from woody biomass, and bio-based diesel, which is satisfied by biodiesel and RD. RFS2’s total advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic fuel and bio-based diesel requirements, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced biofuels.
The RFS2 requirement for advanced biofuels can be satisfied by any advanced biofuel, including biodiesel, RD, renewable jet fuel or better known as sustainable aviation fuel ("SAF"), biogas used in transportation, biobutanol, cellulosic ethanol or sugarcane-based ethanol, so long as it meets the 50% greenhouse gas reduction requirement.
The advanced biofuel RVO is expressed in terms of ethanol equivalent volumes, or EEV, which is based on the fuel’s renewable content and energy content compared to ethanol. Biodiesel has an EEV of 1.5 and RD typically has an EEV of 1.7, compared to 1.0 for sugarcane-based ethanol. Accordingly, it requires less bio-based diesel than sugarcane-based ethanol to meet the required volumes as each gallon of bio-based diesel counts as more gallons for purposes of fulfilling the advanced biofuel RVO, providing an incentive for refiners and importers to purchase bio-based diesel to meet their advanced biofuel RVO.
The RFS2 volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as “Obligated Parties” in the RFS2 regulations. Obligated Parties are required to incorporate into their petroleum-based fuel a certain percentage of renewable fuel or purchase credits in the form of RINs from those who do. 
An Obligated Party’s RVO is based on the volume of petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuel they produce or import. The largest U.S. petroleum refining companies, such as British Petroleum, Chevron, Citgo, ExxonMobil, Holly Frontier, Marathon, Motiva, PBF, Phillips 66, Shell, and Valero, represent the majority of the total RVO, with the remainder made up of smaller refiners and importers.
Renewable Identification Numbers
The EPA created the RIN system to track renewable fuel production and compliance with the renewable fuel standard. EPA registered producers of renewable fuel may generate RINs for each gallon of renewable fuel they produce. In the case of bio-based diesel, generally 1.5 to 1.7 bio-based diesel RINs may be generated for each gallon of bio-based diesel produced, based upon the fuel's renewable energy content. Renewable fuel, including bio-based diesel, can then be sold with associated RINs attached. RINs may also be separated from the gallons of renewable fuel they represent and once separated they may be sold as a separate commodity. RINs are ultimately used by Obligated Parties to demonstrate compliance with RFS2. Obligated Parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An Obligated Party can obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing renewable fuels and generating RINs themselves. All RIN activity under RFS2 must be entered into the EPA’s moderated transaction system, which tracks RIN generation, transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS2 requirements.
The value of RINs can significantly impact the price of bio-based diesel. In 2021, RIN prices as a percentage contribution to the daily average 100% pure biodiesel (B100) spot price, as reported by the Oil Pricing Information System, or OPIS, fluctuated significantly throughout the year and ranged from a low of $1.40 per gallon, or 37% of the average B100 spot price per gallon, in January to a high of $3.07 per gallon, or 50% of the average spot price, in June. 
Biodiesel Tax Credit
The federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, or BTC, provides a $1.00 refundable tax credit per gallon to the first blender of bio-based diesel with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The BTC can then be credited against federal excise tax liability or the blender can obtain a cash refund from the U.S. Treasury for the value of the credit. The BTC was first implemented on January 1, 2005 and has been allowed to lapse multiple times before being retroactively reinstated, as described in the following table:
The BTC is an incentive shared across the advanced biofuel production and distribution chain through routine, daily trading and negotiation. In December 2019, the BTC was retroactively reinstated for 2018 and 2019, and made effective from January 2020 through December 2022.
California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits
In 2006, California passed the Global Warming Solutions Act or AB 32. The legislation established the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, regulation, which is a rule designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a “carbon intensity” ("CI") score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel’s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider (generally the fuel’s producer or importer, or “regulated party”) is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. A regulated party’s fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blendstocks and substitutes. 
We obtain carbon credits when we import and sell qualified bio-based diesel into California. During 2021, California LCFS carbon credits ranged from $142.00 per metric ton to $201.00 per metric ton, as reported by OPIS.
Oregon Clean Fuel Program
The Oregon Clean Fuel Program was launched in 2016 and requires a 10% reduction of the average carbon intensity of Oregon’s transportation fuels from 2015 levels by 2025. The baseline year for the program is 2015 and represents 10% ethanol blended with gasoline and 5% biodiesel blended with diesel. The Oregon Renewable Fuels Standard requires all gasoline sold in the state to be blended with 10% ethanol (E10). In addition, all diesel fuel sold in the state must be blended with at least 5% bio-based diesel. In March of 2020, the Oregon Governor issued an executive order to expand the Clean Fuel Program to achieve at least a 20% reduction from 2015 levels by 2030 and a 25% reduction by 2035. The executive order is currently in a rule making process, with a targeted effective date of January 1, 2023.
We obtain carbon credits when we import and sell qualified bio-based diesel in Oregon. During 2021, Oregon OCF carbon credits ranged from $121.50 per metric ton to $131.00 per metric ton, as reported by OPIS.
Other Government Programs
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 40 states have implemented various programs that encourage the use of bio-based diesel through blending requirements as well as various tax incentives. The chart below summarizes some of the most significant programs.

Government | Program description 
Canada | The federal government has a nationwide requirement of 2% bio-based content in diesel. In addition a number of provinces in Canada have biofuel programs (British Columbia has an LCFS, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario have usage requirements that exceed the federal standard). The federal government is currently engaged in the rulemaking process on a nationwide Clean Fuel Standard, which may incorporate a number of carbon reducing policies. 
New York | In 2019 New York passed the Community Leadership and Climate Protection Act (similar to California's AB 32) which establishes firm carbon reduction goals of 40% reductions by 2030 and 85% reductions in 2050. The state is currently undertaking a rulemaking which will establish an LCFS program for mobile source emissions and fixed source emissions.In 2016, the City of New York adopted legislation requiring 5% bio-based diesel blends for heating oil starting on October 1, 2017 and the blend level then moves to 10% in 2025, 15% in 2030 and 20% in 2034. In 2021, the state legislature passed a state-wide biodiesel requirement for home heating oil starting with B5 in the fall of 2022 and ramping up to B10 in 2025 and B20 in 2030. Connecticut and Rhode Island have also passed requirements to use bio-based diesel in heating oil ramping up to B50 in 2035 and B50 in 2030, respectively.
Illinois | Illinois offers a tax exemption from the generally applicable 6.25% sales tax on fuel for bio-based diesel blends that incentivizes blending at 11% bio-based diesel, or B11, through December 31, 2023. Illinois’ program has made that state one of the largest bio-based diesel markets in the country. 
Iowa | Iowa has a retailer’s incentive for blended fuel which has been modified over time. For 2018 through 2024, retailers earn $0.035 per gallon of 5%-10% biodiesel blends and $0.055 per gallons for 11% and above biodiesel blends. Iowa also has a bio-based diesel production incentive that provides $0.02 per gallon of production capped after the first 25 million gallons per production plant. Iowa also reduces the excise tax on fuel, by $0.024 per gallon for biodiesel blends of 11% and above. Legislation in Iowa has been introduced in the 2022 Iowa Legislature to increase the incentives in a number of areas. 
Minnesota | Minnesota law requires a 5% biodiesel blend except during the summer months (April - September) when a 20% blend is required. There is a two week step up from B5 to B10 in the first two weeks of April prior to the B20 requirement. 
North Dakota | North Dakota offers a $0.05 per gallon sales tax incentive for retailers who sell 5% and above biodiesel blends. 
Pennsylvania | Pennsylvania has adopted legislation requiring bio-based diesel blends beginning at 2% biodiesel blends with incremental increases, provided certain feedstock or production minimums are met. 
Texas | The bio-based diesel portion of bio-based diesel blends are exempt from Texas state excise tax, which results in a $0.20 per gallon incentive for 100% pure biodiesel. 
Washington | In 2021, the state legislature has passed and the governor signed a Clean Fuel Standard. That law sets targets similar to Oregon and California in carbon reduction. The state is currently engaged in a lengthy rulemaking with a goal of implementation in 2023. The City of Seattle has a heating oil tax exemption for the portion of heating oil that is biodiesel. 
U.S. Municipalities | Many cities across the United States have set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New York, Chicago, Atlanta and 34 other cities have set emissions reduction goals of 80 percent or higher by 2050. 

We believe that other government requirements for the use of biofuels increase demand for our bio-based diesel within such regions and they may help increase the overall demand in addition to the RFS2 requirements. We observe that existing demand for our biofuel from Obligated Parties in connection with federal requirements may shift to regions that have use requirements or tax incentive programs.
RED Program
In the European Union, or EU, the Renewable Energy Directive established a 10% target by 2020 for the use of renewable energy in the transport sector in EU member states. Given the existing limited market presence of alternative fuels or electromobility, the majority of the target has been realized through biofuels. In 2018, a revised Renewable Energy Directive, RED II, was established. RED II set a target of 14% renewables in transport and a 32% reduction of greenhouse gases, to be progressively achieved from 2021 until 2030. Biofuels produced from certain types of waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, benefit from extra incentives and so-called advanced feedstocks even get a specific sub-mandate. Additionally, RED II opens up new outlets such as marine fuels or renewable aviation fuels. In 2021, the EU Member States ratified RED II into national legislation. Since the adoption of RED II, the EU has introduced the “European Green Deal”, a package of new measures that are intended to align the EU's environmental goals with the Paris Accord objectives. This resulted in the proposal of a legislative package called "Fit for 55" (meaning 55% GHG reduction by 2030) increasing the target for overall renewables to 40%; the relevant legislative process is expected to be finalized in 2023.
Trends in Market Demand and Competitive Conditions
We face competition from producers and suppliers of petroleum-based diesel fuel, other bio-based diesel producers, marketers, traders and distributors. The size of the bio-based diesel industry is small compared to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitive differentiators are bio-based diesel and RIN quality, supply reliability and price. In the United States, and Canadian bio-based diesel markets, we compete with independent bio-based diesel producers as well as large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. Ag Processing Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill Incorporated, and Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group are major international agribusiness corporations and biodiesel producers with the financial, feedstock sourcing and marketing resources to be formidable competitors in the biodiesel industry. These agribusiness competitors tend to make biodiesel from virgin vegetable oils such as soybean or canola oil, which they produce as part of their integrated agribusinesses. 
We also compete with several large and well capitalized producers of RD. Neste Corporation has approximately 882 million gallons of RD production capacity in Asia and Europe, a significant portion of which is imported into the United States. Neste has announced that it is in the process of expanding its RD production capacity in Singapore. Diamond Green Diesel, LLC, a joint venture between Valero Energy Corporation and Darling Ingredients Inc., operates a 275 mmgy capacity RD facility and their additional 400 mmgy plant is online as of December 2021. In January 2021, Valero Energy Corporation announced that it will build a 470-million-gal/year RD plant in Texas with joint venture partner Darling Ingredients. We also face the prospect that petroleum refiners will be increasingly competitive with us, either by converting oil refineries to produce RD or by co-processing renewable feedstock with crude oil. Several petroleum refiners in the United States have effected conversions of their facilities from crude oil to renewables in the past year including Phillips 66, Holly Frontier, Marathon, Exxon, and Shell. Some of the largest refiners have started co-processing renewable feedstocks or have announced plans to do so. If refinery conversions accelerate or if co-processing expands significantly, the competition we face could increase significantly. 
We also face competition in the bio-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of RD and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation. Competition from imported biodiesel changed significantly in 2018, when the International Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Commerce imposed countervailing duties against unfairly subsidized biodiesel exports to the United States from Argentina and Indonesia. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration data, RD imports from Singapore to the United States have maintained a steady rate. Imports from Singapore totaled 252 million gallons in 2019, 280 million gallons in 2020 and 371 million gallons through November 30, 2021.
In our marketing and distribution operations, besides the integrated producers, we are also faced with competition from bio-based diesel traders such as BP, Lincoln Energy, NGL, Shell, Vitol and others. The integrated producers and traders at times may have advantages because of logistics, feedstock accessibility and price, geographical location to customers, blending infrastructure, financial resources, and risk appetite. These same trading companies may have greater financial resources than we do and are able to take significant bio-based diesel positions in the marketplace. These competitors are often customers and/or suppliers of ours as well.
Seasonality 
Our operating results and working capital needs are influenced by seasonal fluctuations in the price of and demand for biodiesel. Seasonal fluctuations may be based on both the weather and the status of both the BTC and RVO. 
Demand may be higher in the quarters leading up to the expiration of the BTC as customers seek to purchase bio-based diesel when they can benefit from the agreed upon value sharing of the BTC with producers. This higher demand prompted by an expiring BTC has often resulted in reduced demand for biodiesel in the following quarter. In addition, RIN prices may also be subject to seasonal fluctuations. The RIN is dated for the calendar year in which it is generated. Since 20% of an Obligated Party's annual RVO can be satisfied by prior year RINs, most RINs must come from biofuel produced or imported during the RVO year. As a result, RIN prices can be expected to increase as the calendar year progresses if the RIN market is undersupplied compared to that year's RVO and decrease if it is oversupplied.
Seasonal fluctuation in our business also occurs in the colder months when historically there has been reduced demand for biodiesel in northern and eastern U.S. markets, which are some of the primary markets in which we operate. Biodiesel typically has a higher cloud point than petroleum-based diesel or RD. The cloud point is the temperature below which a fuel exhibits a noticeable cloudiness and eventually gels, leading to fuel handling and performance problems for customers and suppliers. Reduced demand in the winter for our higher cloud point biodiesel may result in excess supply of such higher cloud point biodiesel and lower prices for such higher cloud point biodiesel. To mitigate some of these seasonal fluctuations in demand, we have upgraded our Newton and Danville biorefineries to produce distilled biodiesel which improves cold-weather performance.
Government Regulations
Our manufacturing facilities, like other fuel and chemical production facilities, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground; the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; ecological and natural resources; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the public. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with numerous environmental and other regulatory permits to construct and operate each facility. They can require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to human health and the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions could result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and or facility shutdowns. We do not currently have any environmental proceedings either pending or threatened against our facilities that would materially affect our business or financial condition. Furthermore, we do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements as presently in effect.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,093 employees located in the United States and 103 employees located internationally. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining agreements.
We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and an employment package intended to promote well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. In addition, we regularly conduct an employee survey to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee well-being, health and safety.
We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent and produces more creative solutions and innovative products and services. In 2021, we continued to implement and expand certain programs aimed at building an equitable and inclusive culture through a variety of diversity and inclusion initiatives.
Intellectual Property
We own a significant number of U.S. and international patents and expect to file additional patent applications as we continue to pursue innovations. We have also developed trade secrets to protect our know-how, and other proprietary information, including for example the sourcing and processing of low-cost feedstocks and production of renewable fuel products.

Recent Developments
Proposed Merger
On February 27, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Chevron Corporation (“Parent”) and Cyclone Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Subsidiary” and together with Parent, “Buyer”). Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into REG (the “Merger”) with REG continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of our common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to the Merger Agreement or shares of common stock held by holders who have made a valid demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law), will be automatically converted into the right to receive $61.50 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).
At the Effective Time, and as a result of the Merger:
•Each outstanding stock appreciation right with respect to a share of common stock (each, a “Company SAR”) will vest and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, less any applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price applicable to such Company SAR multiplied by (y) the number of shares of common stock subject to such Company SAR.
•Each outstanding restricted stock unit award that vests solely on the passage of time held by a Company non-employee director (each, a “Company Director RSU”) will vest and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, less any applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of common stock subject to such Company Director RSU.
•Each outstanding restricted stock unit award that vests solely on the passage of time and is not a Company Director RSU (each, a “Company Employee RSU”) to the extent vested immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, less any applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of vested shares of common stock subject to such Company Employee RSU. 
•Each outstanding Company Employee RSU Award to the extent unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an “Unvested Company Employee RSU Award”) and certain performance-based restricted stock unit awards set forth on a schedule to the Merger Agreement (the “Scheduled PSU Awards”) will be cancelled and converted into the 
right to receive an amount in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of common stock subject to such Unvested Company Employee RSU Award or Scheduled PSU Award, as applicable (such converted award, an “Assumed RSU Award”). Each Assumed RSU Award will be subject to the vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding Unvested Company Employee RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, with respect to the Scheduled PSU Awards, the performance vesting conditions). 
•Except with respect to the Scheduled PSU Awards, each outstanding restricted stock unit award that corresponds to shares of common stock granted under any Company Benefit Plan and vests based on the achievement of performance goals (each, a “Company PSU Award”) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of common stock subject to such Company PSU Award (assuming that any performance based vesting conditions applicable to such Company PSU Award for any performance period that has not been completed as of the Effective Time are achieved at (x) with respect to Company PSU Awards granted in 2020 and 2021, the greater of the target performance levels and the levels based on actual achievement of pro-rated performance goals through the Effective Time or (y) with respect to Company PSU Awards granted in 2022, the target performance levels) (each such converted award, an “Assumed PSU Award”). Each Assumed PSU Award will be subject to the vesting schedule applicable to the corresponding Company PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any performance based vesting conditions).
The closing of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock; (ii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and clearance by the European Commission or expiration of any applicable waiting period, in each case under EU Regulation 139/2004 (the "EU Clearance"); (iii) the absence of any order or law prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, except if such order or law is immaterial to Parent and (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary materiality qualifications, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing of the Merger, and compliance in all material respects with the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement. In addition, the obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger is subject to the absence, since the date of the Merger Agreement, of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The closing of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, consummation of the Merger will occur on the second business day following the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to closing of the Merger or at such other time as REG and Parent agree.
Our Board of Directors and the board of directors of Merger Subsidiary have each approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. If approved by our stockholders, we currently expect the Merger to close in the second half of 2022. Until the closing, we will continue to operate as an independent company.
