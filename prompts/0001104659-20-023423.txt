RECENT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS

Growth Projects Update:
Below is a summary of our growth projects announced in 2019 and updates to previously announced projects:
PNGTS’ Portland XPress Project - Our estimated $85 million Portland XPress Project or “PXP” was initiated in 2017 in order to expand deliverability on the PNGTS system to Dracut, Massachusetts through re-contracting and construction of incremental compression within PNGTS’ existing footprint in Maine. PXP was designed to be phased in over a three-year time period. Phases I and II were placed into service on November 1, 2018 and November 1, 2019, respectively. Phase III of the project is expected to be in service on November 1, 2020. Beginning in 2021, PXP is expected to generate approximately $50 million in annual revenue for PNGTS. PNGTS filed the required applications with FERC for all three phases of the project in 2018, which included an amendment to its Presidential Permit and an increase in its certificated capacity through the addition of a compressor unit at its jointly owned facility with Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline LLC to bring additional natural gas supply to New England. The total final volume of the project is approximately 183,000 Dth/ day; 40,000 Dth/day from Phase I, 118,400 Dth/day from Phase II, which includes re-contracting and renewal of expiring contracts, and 24,600 Dth/day from Phase III. We continue to advance this project and have received all approvals on filings to date. We expect to file with FERC for approval to proceed with construction of Phase III of the project in early 2020. PXP is secured by long-term agreements and when all phases of the project are in service, PNGTS will be effectively fully contracted until 2032.
Additionally, in connection with PXP, PNGTS entered into an arrangement with TC Energy regarding the construction of certain facilities on the TC Energy system (TransQuebec and Maritimes Pipeline (TQM) and TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline natural gas transmission system (Canadian Mainline)) that will be required to fulfill future PXP contracts on the PNGTS system. In the event the Canadian system expansions terminate prior to their in-service dates, PNGTS could be required to reimburse TC Energy for an amount up to the total outstanding costs incurred to the date of the termination. As a result of TC Energy’s system expansions being commercially in service on November 1, 2019, and PNGTS’ commitments on TC Energy’s upstream pipelines being assigned to the PXP Phase II shippers, PNGTS’ obligation to reimburse the costs for Phase I and II terminated, which was approximately $143 million at the time of termination. Going forward, in the event the Phase III expansion terminates prior to its in-service date, PNGTS will only be obligated to reimburse costs incurred by TC Energy in relation to Phase III, which was $0.6 million at December 31, 2019 and is estimated to be approximately $8.0 million by November 1, 2020, when TC Energy’s facilities associated with the Phase III volumes go into service.

PNGTS' Westbrook XPress Project (Westbrook XPress) - Westbrook XPress is an estimated $125 million multi-phase expansion project that is expected to generate approximately $35 million in revenue for PNGTS on an annualized basis when fully in service. It is part of a coordinated offering to transport incremental Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) natural gas supplies to the Northeast U.S. and Atlantic Canada markets through additional compression capability at an existing PNGTS facility. Westbrook XPress is designed to be phased in over a four-year period which began on November 1, 2019 with Phase I. Phases II and III have estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and 2022, respectively. These three Phases will add incremental capacity of approximately 43,000 Dth/day, 69,000 Dth/day, and 18,000 Dth/day, respectively. Westbrook XPress, together with PXP, will increase PNGTS’ capacity by 90 percent from 210,000 Dth/day to approximately 400,000 Dth/day. The Westbrook XPress contracts expire between 2036 and 2042.
GTN XPress Project (GTN XPress) - On November 1, 2019, we announced that GTN will move forward with the GTN XPress project which will transport approximately 250,000 Dth/day of additional volumes of natural gas enabled by TC Energy’s system expansion upstream. The estimated total project cost of this integrated reliability and expansion project is $335 million. The project’s reliability work is anticipated to be in service by the end of 2021 and will account for more than three quarters of the total project cost. These costs are expected to be recovered in recourse rates. The project’s expansion work is anticipated to be commercially phased into service through November 2023. GTN XPress’ expansion work is 100 percent underpinned by fixed rate negotiated contracts with an average term in excess of 30 years. The incremental capacity is expected to generate approximately $25 million in revenue annually when fully in service.
Tuscarora XPress Project (Tuscarora XPress) - Tuscarora XPress is an estimated $13 million expansion project through additional compression capability at an existing Tuscarora facility. Tuscarora XPress is 100 percent underpinned by a 20-year contract and will transport approximately 15,000 Dth/day of additional volumes when completed in November 2021. Tuscarora XPress is expected to generate approximately $2 million in revenue on an annualized basis when fully in service.
Iroquois Gas Transmission ExC Project (Iroquois ExC Project) - During the second quarter of 2019, Iroquois initiated the “Enhancement by Compression” project (ExC Project) which will optimize the Iroquois system to meet current and future gas supply needs of utility customers while minimizing the environmental impact through enhancements at existing compressor stations along the pipeline. In February 2020, Iroquois filed an application with FERC to authorize the construction of the project. The project’s total design capacity is approximately 125,000 Dth/day with an estimated cost of $250 million and in-service date of November 2023. This project will be 100 percent underpinned with 20-year contracts.
North Baja XPress Project (North Baja XPress) - North Baja XPress is an estimated $90 million potential project to transport additional volumes of natural gas along North Baja’s mainline system. The project was initiated in response to market demand to provide firm transportation service of up to approximately 495,000 Dth/day between Ehrenberg, Arizona and Ogilby, California. The binding open season for the project was concluded in April of 2019. In December 2019, North Baja filed an application with FERC to authorize the construction of this project. The estimated in-service date is November 1, 2022, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions precedent, including a positive Final Investment Decision (FID) from Sempra LNG International, LLC.
PHMSA Compliance Regulation
On October 1, 2019, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) released the first of three anticipated final rulemakings following its issuances in 2016 of an expansive proposed rulemaking (known as the "gas mega rule") revising the regulation of gas transmission and gathering lines. The October 1, 2019 final rule relates specifically to gas transmission pipelines and, among other things, updates reporting and records retention standards for covered pipelines and expands the level of required integrity assessments that must be completed on certain pipeline segments outside of high consequence areas (HCAs). The October 1, 2019 final rule also requires operators to review maximum allowable operating pressure records and perform specific remediation activities where records are not available. We are currently assessing the operational and financial impact related to this ruling which will become effective on July 1, 2020 with a 15-year implementation deadline. The remaining rulemakings comprising the gas mega rule are expected to be issued in 2020. See also Part I, Item 1. “Business- Government Regulation-Pipeline Safety Matters” for more information relating to PHSMA regulation of gas pipelines.
Cash Distributions to Common Units and our General Partner
Our quarterly declared cash distributions in 2019 remained the same as in 2018, which was $0.65 per common unit or $2.60 per common unit in total for the year. Please read Notes 15 within Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” for more information.
On April 23, 2019, the board of directors of our General Partner declared the Partnership’s first quarter 2019 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit, which was paid on May 13, 2019 to unitholders of record as of May 3, 2019. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TC Energy as holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to our General Partner for its two percent general partner interest.

10    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019




On July 23, 2019, the board of directors of our General Partner declared the Partnership’s second quarter 2019 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit, which was paid on August 14, 2019 to unitholders of record as of August 2, 2019. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TC Energy as holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to our General Partner for its two percent general partner interest.
On October 22, 2019, the board of directors of our General Partner declared the Partnership’s third quarter 2019 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit, which was paid on November 14, 2019 to unitholders of record as of November 1, 2019. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TC Energy as holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to our General Partner for its two percent general partner interest.
On January 21, 2020, the board of directors of the General Partner declared the Partnership’s fourth quarter 2019 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit, which was paid on February 14, 2020 to unitholders of record as of January 31, 2020. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TC Energy as a holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to the General Partner for its two percent general partner interest.
Incentive distributions are paid to our General Partner if quarterly cash distributions on the common units exceed levels specified in the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (as amended, the Partnership Agreement). The distributions declared during 2019 did not reach the specified levels for any period and, therefore, the General Partner did not receive any distributions in respect of its IDRs in 2019. See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cash Distribution Policy of the Partnership” for further information regarding the Partnership’s distributions.
Class B Distributions
On January 21, 2020, the board of directors of our General Partner declared its annual Class B distribution in the amount of $8 million, which was paid on February 14, 2020. In 2019, the Class B distribution paid was $13 million. Please read Notes 11, 14 and 15 within Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” for more detailed disclosures on the Class B units.
Other Business Developments
Partnership structure - On December 31, 2018, the General Partner contributed its 1.0101 percent general partner interest in each of TC PipeLines Intermediate Limited Partnership, TC Tuscarora Intermediate Limited Partnership and TC GL Intermediate Limited Partnership (together, the Partnership ILPs) to TC PipeLines Intermediate GP, LLC (the Intermediate GP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, and received a one percent general partner interest in the Partnership in return (the ILP Contribution). This resulted in a simplification of the General Partner’s effective two percent general interest in the Partnership previously held through its directly-held one percent and indirectly-held 1.0101 percent general partner interests in the Partnership and Partnership ILPs, respectively, to a directly-held two percent general partner interest in the Partnership. The Partnership subsequently held 100 percent of the Partnership ILPs’ limited and general partner interests, with the general partner interest being held through the Intermediate GP.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Partnership initiated the dissolution of the Partnership ILPs and Intermediate GP. Effective October 31, 2019, the Intermediate GP and Partnership ILPs transferred 100 percent of the ownership of their pipeline assets to the Partnership, and the process of dissolving and unwinding the entities was completed in January 2020. Accordingly, the Partnership now owns its pipeline assets directly, which creates a more efficient partnership structure and aligns more closely with other MLP structures existing today, with no economic impact to the general and limited partners of the Partnership.
Financing
Partnership’s 2013 $500 Million Term Loan Facility - In June 2019, the Partnership repaid $50 million of outstanding borrowings under its 2013 $500 million Term Loan Facility using the proceeds received from the Northern Border distribution on the same date. Additionally, the Partnership terminated an equivalent amount in interest rate swaps that were used to hedge this facility at a rate of 2.81%.
Partnership’s Senior Credit Facility and Overall Debt Level - We continue to deleverage our balance sheet. At December 31, 2019, there was no outstanding balance under the Partnership's Senior Credit Facility. Additionally, the Partnership's overall consolidated debt was reduced by $106 million from $2,118 million at December 31, 2018 to $2,012 million at December 31, 2019 as a result of the (a) $40 million net repayment from cash flow of the outstanding balance under the Partnership's Senior Credit facility; (b) $50 million partial repayment of the Partnership's 2013 $500 Million Term Loan 

TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019    11




Facility; (c) the repayment of $35 million due upon the maturity of GTN's $75 million Unsecured Term Loan Facility; and (d) $1 million scheduled payment on Tuscarora's Unsecured Term Loan offset by $20 million of additional borrowings on PNGTS' revolving credit facility. See Part II, Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources" for more information.
Credit Rating Upgrade - On July 23, 2019, Standard & Poor's (S&P) upgraded the Partnership’s credit rating to BBB/Stable from BBB-/Stable primarily due to the improvement in our financial risk profile resulting from our ongoing deleveraging efforts.
Financing – Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
Northern Border - In June 2019, Northern Border borrowed an additional $100 million under its $200 million revolving credit facility to finance a $100 million cash distribution, of which $50 million was received by the Partnership. Northern Border's outstanding balance under this facility amounted to $115 million at December 31, 2019.
Iroquois Financing - On May 9, 2019, Iroquois refinanced $140 million of 6.63% Senior Notes due 2019 and $150 million of 4.84% Senior Notes due in 2020 by issuing $140 million of new 15-year 4.12% Senior Notes and $150 million of new 10-year 4.07% Senior Notes. The debt covenants require Iroquois to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio below 75 percent and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25 times for the four preceding quarters and are unchanged from those governing the refinanced Senior Notes.

Understanding the Natural Gas Infrastructure Business
Natural gas infrastructure moves natural gas from major sources of supply or upstream gathering facilities to downstream locations or markets that use natural gas to meet their energy needs. Infrastructure systems include meter stations that record how much natural gas comes on to the pipeline and how much exits at the delivery locations; compressor stations that act like pumps to move the large volumes of natural gas along the pipeline; and the pipelines themselves that transport natural gas under high pressure.
Regulation, rates and cost recovery
Interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated by FERC. FERC approves the construction of new facilities and regulates aspects of our business including the maximum rates that are allowed to be charged. Maximum rates are based on operating costs, which include allowances for operating and maintenance costs, income and property taxes, interest on debt, depreciation expense to recover invested capital and a return on the capital invested. During 2018, FERC issued a revised policy statement that changed its long-standing policy on the treatment of income taxes for rate-making purposes for MLP-owned pipelines. The revised policy statement had a significant impact on MLPs in general and on their respective natural gas pipeline assets. (See also Part I, Item 1. “Business- Government Regulation- 2018 FERC Actions for” more information).
Although FERC regulates maximum rates for services, interstate natural gas pipelines frequently face competition and therefore may choose to discount their services in order to compete.
Because FERC rate reviews are periodic and not annual, actual revenues and costs typically vary from those projected during a rate case. If revenues no longer provide a reasonable opportunity to recover costs, a pipeline can file with FERC for a determination of new rates, subject to any moratoriums in effect. FERC also has the authority to initiate a review to determine whether a pipeline’s rates of return are just and reasonable. In some cases, a settlement or agreement with the pipeline’s shippers is achieved, precluding the need for FERC to conduct a rate case, which may include mutually beneficial performance incentives. A settlement is ultimately subject to FERC approval.
Contracting
New infrastructure projects are typically supported by long-term contracts. The term of the contracts is dependent on the individual developer’s appetite for risk and is a function of expected rates of return, stability and certainty of returns. Transportation contracts expire at varying times and underpin varying amounts of capacity. As existing contracts 

12    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019




approach their expiration dates, efforts are made to extend and/or renew the contracts. If market conditions are not favorable at the time of renewal, transportation capacity may remain uncontracted, be contracted at lower rates or be contracted on a shorter-term basis. Unsold capacity may be recontracted if and when market conditions become more favorable. The ability to extend and/or renew expiring contracts and the terms of such subsequent contracts will depend upon the overall commercial environment for natural gas transportation and consumption in the region in which the pipeline is situated.
Business environment
The North American natural gas infrastructure network has been developed to connect supply to market. Use and growth of the systems are affected by changes in the location, relative cost of natural gas supply and changing market demand.
The map below shows the location of certain North American basins in relation to our systems together with those of our General Partner and TC Energy.

Supply
Natural gas is primarily transported from producing regions and, in limited circumstances, from liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities to market hubs or interconnects for distribution to natural gas consumers. The ongoing development of shale and other unconventional gas reserves has resulted in increases in overall North American natural gas production and economically recoverable reserves.
There has been an increase in production from the development of shale gas reserves that are located close to traditional markets, particularly in the Northeastern U.S. This has increased the number of supply choices for natural gas consumers and has contributed to the decline of higher-cost sources of supply (such as certain offshore gas production from Atlantic Canada) resulting in changes to historical natural gas pipeline flow patterns.
The supply of natural gas in North America is expected to continue increasing over the next decade and over the long-term for a number of reasons, including the following:

● | use of technology, including horizontal drilling in combination with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, is allowing companies to access unconventional resources economically. This is increasing the technically accessible resource base of existing and emerging gas basins; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | application of these technologies to existing oil fields where further recovery of the existing resource is now possible. There is often associated natural gas discovered in the exploration and production of liquids-rich
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019    13





hydrocarbons (for example the Bakken oil fields), which also contributes to an increase in the overall natural gas supply for North America.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other factors that can influence the overall level of natural gas supply in North America include:

● | the price of natural gas – low prices in North America may increase demand but reduce drilling activities that in turn diminish production levels, particularly in dry natural gas fields where the extra revenue generated from the associated liquids is not available. High natural gas prices may encourage higher drilling activities but may decrease the level of demand;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | producer portfolio diversification – large producers often diversify their portfolios by developing several basins, but this is influenced by actual costs to develop the resource as well as economic access to markets and cost of pipeline transportation services. Basin-on-basin competition impacts the extent and timing of a resource development that, in turn, drives changing dynamics for pipeline capacity demand; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory and public scrutiny – changes in regulations that apply to natural gas production and consumption could impact the cost and pace of development of natural gas in North America.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demand
The natural gas pipeline business ultimately depends on a shipper’s demand for pipeline capacity and the price paid for that capacity. Demand for pipeline capacity is influenced by, among other things, supply and market competition, economic activity, weather conditions, natural gas pipeline and storage competition and the price of alternative fuels.
The growing supply of natural gas has resulted in relatively low natural gas prices in North America which has supported increased demand for natural gas particularly in the following areas:

● | natural gas-fired power generation;
--+------------------------------------


● | petrochemical and industrial facilities;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | the production of the Marcellus, Alberta’s oil sands, and the Bakken and shale deposits, although new greenfield projects that have not begun construction may be delayed in the current oil price environment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exports to Mexico to fuel electric power generation facilities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exports from North America to global markets through a number of proposed LNG export facilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commodity Prices
In general, the profitability of the natural gas pipelines business is not directly tied to commodity prices given we are a transporter of the commodity and the transportation costs are not tied to the price of natural gas. However, the cyclical supply and demand nature of commodities and its price impact can have a secondary impact on our business where our shippers may choose to accelerate or delay certain projects. This can impact the timing for the demand of transportation services and/or new gas pipeline infrastructure.
Competition
Competition among natural gas pipelines is based primarily on transportation rates and proximity to natural gas supply areas and consuming markets. Changes in supply locations and regional demand have resulted in changes to pipeline flow dynamics. Where pipelines historically transported natural gas from one or two supply sources to their markets under long-term contracts, today many pipelines transport gas in multiple directions and under shorter contract terms. Some pipelines have even reversed their flows in order to adapt to changing sources of supply. Competition among pipelines to attract supply and new or existing markets to their systems has also increased across North America.
Our Natural Gas Infrastructure
We have ownership interests in eight natural gas interstate pipeline systems that are collectively designed to transport approximately 10.9 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from producing regions and import facilities to market hubs and consuming markets primarily in the Western, Midwestern and Eastern U.S. All our pipeline systems, except Iroquois and the pipeline facilities jointly owned with MNE on PNGTS (Joint Facilities), are operated by subsidiaries of TC Energy. The Iroquois pipeline system is operated by Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Iroquois. The Joint Facilities are operated by M&N Operating Company, LLC (MNOC), a subsidiary of Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline LLC (MNE). MNE is a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc.

The map below shows the location of our pipeline systems.


Customers, Contracting and Demand
Our customers are generally large utilities, Local Distribution Companies (LDCs), major natural gas marketers, producing companies and other interstate pipelines, including affiliates. Our systems generate revenue by charging rates for transporting natural gas. Natural gas transportation service is provided pursuant to long-term and short-term contracts on a firm or interruptible basis. The majority of our pipeline systems' natural gas transportation services are provided through firm service transportation contracts with a reservation or demand charge that reserves pipeline capacity, regardless of use, for the term of the contract. The revenues associated with capacity reserved under firm service transportation contracts are not subject to fluctuations caused by changing supply and demand conditions, competition or customers. Customers with interruptible service transportation agreements may utilize available capacity after firm service transportation requests are satisfied.
Our pipeline systems actively market their available capacity and work closely with customers, including natural gas producers, LDCs, marketers and end users, to ensure our pipelines are offering attractive services and competitive rates. Approximately 70 percent of our long-term contract revenues are with customers who have an investment grade rating or who have provided guarantees from investment grade parties. We have obtained financial assurances as permitted by FERC and our tariffs for the remaining long-term contracts. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Transactions with our major customers that are at least 10 percent of our consolidated revenues can be found under Note 17-Transactions with major customers within Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules," which information is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, our equity investee Great Lakes earns a significant portion of its revenue from TC Energy and its affiliates as disclosed under Note 18-Related party transactions within Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules,” which information is incorporated herein by reference.
GTN – GTN’s revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts through the end of 2023 with its remaining contracts extending between 2024 and 2045. These contracts, which have historically been renewed on a long-term basis upon expiration, are primarily held by residential and commercial LDCs and power generators that use a diversified portfolio of transportation options to serve their long-term markets and marketers under a variety of contract terms. A small portion of our contract portfolio is contracted by industrial shippers and producers. We expect GTN to continue to be an important transportation component of these diversified portfolios. Incremental transportation opportunities are based on the difference in value between Western Canadian natural gas supplies and deliveries to Northern California.
In 2018, GTN benefitted from an increase in the quantity of natural gas it transports as debottlenecking activities occurred on upstream pipeline systems which deliver natural gas to GTN. These upstream activities are continuing and, as a result, we have signed over 700,000 Dth/day in long-term contracts starting between 2018 and 2020, of which 348,000 Dth/day resulted in additional quantity flowing onto GTN mid-2018, and 114,000 Dth/day in the fourth quarter of 2019. The

remaining quantity is expected to begin to flow in mid-2020. The majority of these contracts have terms of at least 15 years.
On January 29, 2019, GTN’s largest customer, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Pacific Gas), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Pacific Gas accounted for approximately seven percent of the Partnership’s consolidated revenues in 2019 (2018 - six percent). As a utility company, Pacific Gas serves residential and industrial customers in the state of California and has an ongoing obligation to serve its customers. We have not experienced collection issues in 2019 and we do not expect the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas to have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced the GTN XPress project, our largest organic opportunity in TCP’s 20-year history. This project includes a horsepower replacement program and a brownfield expansion. The reliability work will enable increased firm natural gas transportation on GTN, which together with the growth component of the project, will sum to 250,000 Dth/d in additional long-term contracts on the pipeline system. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects” for more information.
Northern Border – Northern Border is a highly competitive pipeline system with a weighted average remaining contract length of approximately 4 years. Northern Border contracts that include renewal rights and expiring contracts have typically been renewed for terms of five years. A significant portion of Northern Border’s contract portfolio is contracted by utilities, marketers and industrial load. In addition, Northern Border sells seasonal transportation services which have traditionally been strongest during peak winter months to serve heating demand and peak spring/summer months to serve electric cooling demand and storage injection.
Great Lakes – Great Lakes' revenue is derived from both short-haul and long-haul transportation services. The majority of its contracts are with TC Energy and affiliates on multiple paths across its system. Great Lakes' ability to sell its available and future capacity will depend on future market conditions which are impacted by a number of factors including weather, levels of natural gas in storage, the capacity of upstream and downstream pipelines and the availability and pricing of natural gas supplies. Demand for Great Lakes' services has historically been highest in the summer to fill the natural gas storage complexes in Ontario and Michigan in advance of the upcoming winter season. During the winter, Great Lakes serves peak heating requirements for customers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and the upper Midwest of the U.S.
A significant portion of Great Lakes’ total contract portfolio is contracted by its affiliates including its long-term transportation agreement with TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline that commenced on November 1, 2017 for a ten-year period that allows TC Energy to transport up to 0.711 billion cubic feet (equivalent to about 722,000 Dth/day) of natural gas per day on the Great Lakes system. This contract, which contains volume reduction options up to full contract quantity until November 1, 2020, was a direct benefit from TC Energy’s long-term fixed price service on its Canadian Mainline that was launched in 2017. TC Energy’s long-term fixed price service provides long-term capacity to TC Energy’s shippers for the transportation of WCSB natural gas to markets in Eastern Canada and the U.S.
During the second quarter of 2018, Great Lakes reached an agreement on the terms of new long-term transportation capacity contracts with its affiliate, ANR Pipeline Company. The contracts are for a term of 15 years from November 2021 to October 31, 2036 with a total contract value of approximately $1.3 billion on 0.9 billion of cubic feet (equivalent to about 913,000 Dth/day) capacity. The contracts contain reduction options (i) at any time on or before April 1, 2020 for any reason and (ii) any time before April 2021, if TC Energy is not able to secure the required regulatory approval related to anticipated expansion projects. During the first quarter of 2019, Great Lakes reached an agreement to amend a volume reduction “for any reason” option by extending the period “on or before” April 1, 2019 to “on or before” April 1, 2020. All the other terms remained the same.
PNGTS – PNGTS’ revenues are primarily generated from transportation agreements with LDCs throughout New England and Canada’s Atlantic provinces. The majority of PNGTS’ current revenue stream is supported by long-term contracts entered into via a series of open seasons for long-term capacity held by PNGTS in recent years. Long-term contract commitments of approximately 82,000 Dth/day from PNGTS’ Continent-to-Coast Contracts with several shippers for a term of 15 years (the C2C Contracts) open season began December 1, 2017, necessitating an increase in PNGTS’ certificated capacity up to approximately 210,000 Dth/day. The C2C Contracts mature in 2032.
In addition to the C2C Contracts, in 2017, as a result of its PXP open season, PNGTS executed 20-year precedent agreements with several LDCs in New England and Atlantic Canada to re-contract certain system capacity set to expire in 2019 as well as expand the PNGTS system. PXP Phases I and II were placed into service on November 1, 2018 and November 1, 2019, respectively. Phase III of the project is expected to be in service on November 1, 2020. The total final volume of the project is approximately 183,000 Dth/ day: 40,000 Dth/day from Phase I, 118,400 Dth/day from Phase II, which includes re-contracting and renewal of expiring contracts, and 24,600 Dth/day from Phase III. PXP, together with the C2C expansion brings additional, natural gas supply options to markets in New England and Atlantic Canada in response to the growing need for natural gas transportation capacity in the region.
PXP is fully subscribed with no uncontracted firm capacity to meet incremental market demand in this region. In response, PNGTS developed a second expansion project. In early 2019, PNGTS announced the Westbrook XPress project which is 

TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019    17




an independent project that is designed to be phased in over a four-year period beginning November 1, 2019 with Phase I. Phases II and III have estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and 2022, respectively. Westbrook XPress will add incremental capacity of approximately 43,000 Dth/day, 69,000 Dth/day, and 18,000 Dth/day, respectively. Westbrook XPress, together with PXP, will increase PNGTS’ capacity by 90 percent from 210,000 Dth/day to approximately 400,000 Dth/day. PNGTS signed precedent agreements for Phases II and III of Westbrook XPress, pending receipt of various regulatory and corporate approvals. The Westbrook XPress contracts expire between 2036 and 2042. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects” for more information about PXP and Westbrook XPress.
Iroquois – Iroquois transports natural gas under long-term contracts that expire between 2019 and 2026 and extends from TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline system at the U.S. border near Waddington, New York to markets in the U.S. northeast, including New York City, Long Island and Connecticut. Iroquois provides service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end users, directly or indirectly, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges throughout the northeastern U.S. Iroquois also earns discretionary transportation service revenues which can have a significant earnings impact. Discretionary transportation service revenues include short-term firm transportation service contracts with less than one-year terms as well as standard interruptible transportation service contracts. In 2019, Iroquois earned approximately 12 percent of its revenues from discretionary services.
During the second quarter of 2019, Iroquois initiated the ExC Project to meet current and future gas supply needs of utility customers by upgrading its compressor stations along the pipeline. This project will be 100 percent underpinned with 20-year contracts and is subject to necessary permits and approvals. This project has an estimated in-service date of November 2023. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects” for more information.
North Baja – The North Baja pipeline system is an 86-mile bi-directional natural gas pipeline transporting gas between Arizona, California and the Mexican border since 2002. North Baja’s historical steady financial performance is due to its strong contracting levels, having a weighted average remaining firm contract length of about 7 years. North Baja currently has a design capacity of 500 mcf/d of southbound transportation and is capable of transporting 600 mcf/d in a northbound direction.
In April 2019, we concluded a successful binding open season for North Baja XPress project to transport additional volumes of natural gas along North Baja’s mainline system between Arizona and California. The estimated in-service date of the project is November 2022, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions precedent including positive FID from Sempra LNG International, LLC. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects” for more information.
Bison – As previously disclosed, natural gas is not flowing on the Bison system in response to the recent relative cost advantage of WCSB and Bakken sourced gas versus Rockies production. From its in-service date in 2011 up to the fourth quarter of 2018, Bison was fully contracted on a ship-or-pay basis. During the fourth quarter of 2018, through a Permanent Capacity Release Agreement, Tenaska Marketing Ventures (Tenaska) assumed Anadarko Energy Services Company’s (Anadarko) ship-or-pay contract obligation on Bison, the largest contract on Bison. After assuming the transportation obligation, Bison accepted an offer from Tenaska to terminate this contract. Following the amendment of its tariff to enable this transaction, another customer executed a similar agreement to terminate its contract on Bison. At the completion of the contracts, Bison was released from performing any future services with the two customers and as such, the amounts received were recorded in revenue in 2018.
The two customers represented approximately 60 percent of Bison’s revenue and accordingly, in 2019, Bison’s revenue was reduced by approximately $47 million. Its remaining contracts in the system expire in January 2021. Bison will therefore be approximately 40 percent contracted on a ship-or-pay basis in 2020 and is expected to generate approximately $30 million in revenue, similar to 2019.
Based on this development and other qualitative factors, the Partnership evaluated the remaining carrying value of Bison’s property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2018 and concluded that the entire amount was no longer recoverable, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to explore alternative transportation-related options for Bison and we believe commercial potential exists to reverse the direction of natural gas flow on Bison for deliveries onto third party pipelines and ultimately connect into the Cheyenne hub. See also Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates” for more information.
Tuscarora – Tuscarora’s revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts with a weighted average remaining contract length of approximately 5 years. We expect Tuscarora to continue be fully contracted on a long-term basis when its current contracts expire.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced that we are proceeding with the Tuscarora XPress project, an expansion project through additional compression capability at an existing Tuscarora facility that is expected to increase capacity by approximately 7 percent by November 2021. Tuscarora XPress is 100 percent underpinned by a 20-year contract. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects” for more information.

Competition
Overall, our pipeline systems generate a substantial portion of their cash flow from long-term firm contracts for transportation services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. If these long-term contracts are not renewed at their expiration, our pipeline systems face competitive pressures which influence contract renewals and rates charged for transportation services.
GTN and Northern Border, through their respective connections with TC Energy's Foothills systems, and Great Lakes and Iroquois, through their respective connections with TC Energy's Canadian Mainline, compete with each other for WCSB natural gas supply as well as with other pipelines, including the Alliance pipeline and the Westcoast pipeline. Northern Border and Great Lakes compete in their respective market areas for natural gas supplies from other basins as well, such as the Bakken, Rocky Mountain area, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, Utica and Marcellus basins. GTN primarily competes with pipelines supplying natural gas into California and Pacific Northwest markets.
Bison competes for deliveries with other pipelines that transport natural gas supplies within and away from the Rocky Mountain area, and gas from the Rocky Mountains that is delivered into the Midwest must compete with gas sourced from the Bakken and Western Canada.
North Baja’s southbound pipeline capacity competes with deliveries of LNG received at the Costa Azul terminal in Mexico. If LNG shipments are received at Costa Azul, North Baja’s northbound capacity competes with pipelines that deliver Rocky Mountain area, Permian and San Juan basin natural gas into the southern California area.
Tuscarora competes for deliveries primarily into the northern Nevada natural gas market with natural gas from the Rocky Mountain area.
PNGTS connects with the TQM pipeline at the Canadian border and shares facilities with the MNE from Westbrook, Maine to a connection with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline System near Boston, Massachusetts. PNGTS competes with LNG supplies and gas flows from Canada and with LNG delivered into Boston. Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Algonquin Gas Transmission also compete with PNGTS for gas deliveries into New England markets.
As noted above, Iroquois, through its connection with TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline System, competes for WCSB natural gas supply with other pipelines. Iroquois connects at five locations with three interstate pipelines (Tennessee Gas, CNG Gas Transmission and Algonquin Gas Transmission) and TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline System near Waddington, New York and provides a link between WCSB natural gas deliveries to markets in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island.
Additionally, our pipeline assets face competition from other pipeline companies seeking opportunities to invest in greenfield natural gas pipeline development opportunities. This competition could result in fewer projects being available that meet our pipeline systems’ investment hurdles or projects that proceed with lower overall financial returns.
Relationship with TC Energy
TC Energy is the indirect parent of our General Partner and at December 31, 2019, owns, through its subsidiaries, approximately 24 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our IDRs and has a two percent general partner interest in us. TC Energy is a major energy infrastructure company, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NYSE, with more than 65 years of experience in the responsible development and reliable operation of energy infrastructure in North America. TC Energy’s business is primarily focused on natural gas and liquids transmission and power generation services, delivering the energy millions of people rely on to power their lives in a sustainable way. TC Energy consists of investments in 57,900 miles of natural gas pipelines, approximately 3,000 miles of liquids pipelines and 653 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity. TC Energy also owns or has interests in approximately 6,000 megawatts of power generation. TC Energy operates most of our pipeline systems and, in some cases, contracts for pipeline capacity.
See also Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” for more information on our relationship with TC Energy.

Government Regulation
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
All of our pipeline systems are regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and Energy Policy Act of 2005, which gives FERC jurisdiction to regulate effectively all aspects of our business, including:

● | transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | rates and charges;
--+-------------------

TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019    19





● | terms of service and service contracts with customers, including counterparty credit support requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | certification and construction of new facilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | extension or abandonment of service and facilities;

● | acquisition and disposition of facilities;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | initiation and discontinuation of services; and
--+------------------------------------------------


● | standards of conduct for business relations with certain affiliates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Our pipeline systems’ operating revenues are determined based on rate options stated in our tariffs which are approved by FERC. Tariffs specify the general terms and conditions for pipeline transportation service including the rates that may be charged. FERC, either through hearing a rate case or as a result of approving a negotiated rate settlement, approves the maximum rates permissible for transportation service on a pipeline system which are designed to recover the pipeline’s cost-based investment, operating expenses and a reasonable return for its investors. Once maximum rates are set, a pipeline system is not permitted to adjust the maximum rates to reflect changes in costs or contract demand until new rates are approved by FERC. Pipelines are permitted to charge rates lower than the maximum tariff rates in order to compete. As a result, earnings and cash flows of each pipeline system depend on a number of factors including costs incurred, contracted capacity and transportation path, the volume of natural gas transported, and rates charged.

2018 FERC Actions
Background:
During the latter part of 2018, the Partnership completed its regulatory filings to address the issues contemplated by Public Law No. 115-97, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act) and certain FERC actions that began in March of 2018, namely FERC’s Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (Revised Policy Statement) and a Final Rule that established a schedule by which interstate pipelines must either (i) file a new uncontested rate settlement or (ii) file a one-time report, called FERC Form No. 501-G, that quantified the rate impact of the 2017 Tax Act on FERC-regulated pipelines and the impact of the Revised Policy Statement on pipelines held by MLPs (collectively, the 2018 FERC Actions).
Pipelines filing FERC Form No. 501-G had four options:

● | Option 1: make a limited NGA Section 4 filing to reduce its rates by the reduction in its cost of service shown in its FERC Form No. 501-G. For any pipeline electing this option, FERC guaranteed a three-year moratorium on NGA Section 5 rate investigations if the pipeline’s FERC Form 501-G showed the pipeline’s estimated return on equity (ROE) as being 12 percent or less. Under the Final Rule and notwithstanding the Revised Policy Statement, a pipeline organized as an MLP is not required to eliminate its income tax allowance, but instead can reduce its rates to reflect the reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. Alternatively, the MLP pipeline can eliminate its tax allowance, along with its Accumulated Deferred Income Tax (ADIT) used for rate-making purposes. In situations where the ADIT balance is a liability, this elimination would have the effect of increasing the pipeline’s rate base used for rate-making purposes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Option 2: commit to file either a pre-packaged uncontested rate settlement or a general Section 4 rate case if it believed that using the limited Section 4 option would not result in just and reasonable rates. If the pipeline committed to file by December 31, 2018, FERC would not initiate a Section 5 investigation of its rates prior to that date;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Option 3: file a statement explaining its rationale for why it did not believe the pipeline's rates must change; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Option 4: take no action. FERC would then consider whether to initiate a Section 5 investigation of any pipeline that had not submitted a limited Section 4 rate filing or committed to file a general Section 4 rate case.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Impact of the 2018 FERC Actions to the Partnership:
The 2018 FERC Actions directly addressed two components of our pipeline systems’ cost-of-service based rates: the allowance for income taxes and the inclusion of ADIT in their rate base. The 2018 FERC Actions also noted that precise treatment of entities with more ambiguous ownership structures must be separately resolved on a case-by-case basis, such as those partially owned by corporations including Great Lakes, Northern Border, Iroquois and PNGTS. Additionally, any FERC-mandated rate reduction did not affect negotiated rate contracts.

20    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019




Prior to the 2018 FERC Actions, none of the Partnership’s pipeline systems had a requirement to file or adjust their rates earlier than 2022 as a result of their existing rate settlements. However, several of our pipeline systems accelerated such adjustments as a result of the 2018 FERC Actions. The actions taken by our pipelines are outlined below:

​ | ​ | | ​ | | ​ |

​
The Final Rule allowed pipelines owned by MLPs and other pass through entities to remove the ADIT liability from their rate bases, and thus increase the net recoverable rate base, partially or in some cases wholly mitigated the loss of the tax allowance in cost-of-service based rates. Following the elimination of the tax allowance and the ADIT liability from rate base, rate settlements and related filings of all pipelines held wholly or in part by the Partnership summarized above, the estimated impact of the tax-related changes to our revenue and cash flow is a reduction of approximately $30 million per year on an annualized basis beginning in 2019.
In 2019, the estimated impact of the tax-related changes to our revenue and cashflow have been largely mitigated by additional revenue generated from continued strong natural gas flows mainly out of WCSB and from solid contracting levels across the Partnership pipeline assets. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.

TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019    21




Filings required by the Final Rule and Rate Settlements:
GTN
On October 16, 2018, GTN filed an uncontested settlement with FERC to address the changes proposed by the 2018 FERC Actions on its rates via an amendment to its prior 2015 settlement (the 2018 GTN Settlement). The 2018 GTN Settlement reflects an elimination of the tax allowance previously recovered in rates along with ADIT for rate-making purposes (see details of the 2018 GTN Settlement in the table above).
Tuscarora
On December 6, 2018, Tuscarora elected to make a limited NGA Section 4 filing to reduce its maximum rates by approximately 1.7 percent and eliminate its deferred income tax balances previously used for rate setting (Option 1). On March 15, 2019, Tuscarora filed an uncontested settlement with FERC to address the issues contemplated by the 2017 Tax Act and 2018 FERC Actions via an amendment to its prior 2016 settlement (the 2019 Tuscarora Settlement).
Among the terms of the 2019 Tuscarora Settlement, Tuscarora agreed to reduce its existing maximum system rates by 1.7 percent effective February 1, 2019 through to July 31, 2019, followed by an additional decrease of 10.8 percent for the period August 1, 2019 through the term of the settlement. Tuscarora is required to have new rates in effect on February 1, 2023. Tuscarora and its customers also agreed on a moratorium on rate changes until January 31, 2023. The 2019 Tuscarora Settlement, which was approved by FERC on May 2, 2019, will also reflect an elimination of the tax allowance previously recovered in rates along with ADIT for rate-making purposes.
Iroquois
On December 6, 2018, Iroquois submitted its FERC Form No. 501-G in response to the FERC Final Rule along with an explanation as to why rate changes were not required. On February 28, 2019, Iroquois filed an uncontested settlement with FERC to address the issues contemplated by the 2017 Tax Act and 2018 FERC Actions via an amendment to its prior 2016 settlement (the 2019 Iroquois Settlement). Among the terms of the 2019 Iroquois Settlement, Iroquois agreed to reduce its existing maximum system rates by 6.5 percent to be implemented in two phases, (i) effective March 1, 2019, a 3.25 percent rate reduction and (ii) effective April 1, 2020, an additional 3.25 percent rate reduction, which will conclude the total 6.5 percent rate reduction from the 2016 settlement rates. The 2019 Iroquois Settlement, which was approved by FERC on May 2, 2019, preserved the 2016 settlement moratorium on further rate changes until September 1, 2020. Unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, Iroquois will be required to have new rates in effect by March 1, 2023.
Existing Settlements with subsequent limited section 4 rate reductions
Great Lakes – Great Lakes operates under a settlement approved by FERC effective January 1, 2018 (the 2017 Great Lakes Settlement). The 2017 Great Lakes Settlement did not contain a moratorium and eliminated its revenue sharing mechanism with customers. Great Lakes is required to file new rates effective October 1, 2022. Effective February 1, 2019, FERC approved an additional 2 percent rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to Great Lakes’ limited NGA Section 4 filing. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and mitigated the loss of Great Lakes’ tax allowance.
Northern Border – Northern Border operates under a settlement approved by FERC effective January 1, 2018 (the 2017 Northern Border Settlement). The 2017 Northern Border Settlement provided for tiered rate reductions from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 that equate to an overall rate reduction of 12.5 percent when compared to 2017 rates by January 1, 2020 (10.5 percent by December 31, 2019 and additional two percent by January 1, 2020). The 2017 Northern Border Settlement did not contain a moratorium and Northern Border is required to file new rates effective July 1, 2024. Effective February 1, 2019, FERC approved an additional two percent rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to Northern Border’s limited NGA Section 4 filing. On April 4, 2019, Northern Border filed an amended settlement agreement that extended the two percent rate reduction implemented on February 1, 2019 to July 1, 2024 effective January 1, 2020 unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement. On May 24, 2019, FERC approved the amended settlement agreement and Northern Border’s 501-G proceeding was terminated. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and mitigated the loss of Northern Border’s tax allowance.
Bison – Bison operates under the rates approved by FERC in connection with Bison's initial construction and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding.
North Baja – North Baja operates under the rates approved by FERC in its original certificate proceeding in 2001 and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. Effective December 1, 2019, FERC approved a 10.8 percent rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to North Baja’s limited NGA Section 4 filing. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and partially mitigated the loss of North Baja’s tax allowance.

22    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019




PNGTS – PNGTS operates under the rates approved by FERC in PNGTS’ most recent rate proceeding, effective December 1, 2010. PNGTS has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding.
NOI on Certificate Policy Statement
FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018 (Certificate Policy Statement NOI), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the Certificate Policy Statement NOI that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. Any proposed changes to the current policy will be prospective only and it is expected that FERC will take many months to determine whether there will be any changes to proposed natural gas pipeline projects. We do not expect changes in this policy to affect us in a materially different manner than other similarly sized natural gas pipeline companies operating in the United States. 
Environmental Matters
Our assets are subject to a variety of stringent U.S. federal, tribal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, biodiversity, wastewater discharges, waste management, water management, and water quality. These laws and regulations generally require natural gas pipeline companies to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits and other authorizations required for construction and operations. Consequences of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, or authorizations include, but are not limited to, the following: administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties; imposition of investigatory, remedial, and/or corrective actions; delay in obtaining necessary authorizations; denial or termination of project authorizations; imposition of restrictions or limitations on project authorizations; addition or removal of conditions or terms in project authorizations; and/or the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting operations or construction. Violations of certain environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of strict, joint and several liability.
Federal Environmental Laws and Regulations
​
Federal environmental laws, and their related regulations, that most significantly impact our pipeline operations include:

● | the Clean Air Act (CAA), which regulates air pollution on a national level by restricting the emission of air pollutants from various stationary and mobile sources and imposes an array of pre-construction, operational, monitoring, and reporting requirements. The CAA authorizes the EPA to adopt climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;

Regional, State, Tribal, and Local Environmental Laws and Regulations
In addition to the numerous environmental laws and regulations at the federal level, there are also regional, state, tribal, and local environmental laws and regulations that sometimes make permitting, development, or expansion of certain projects more extensive and complex. For example, some of our projects may require the acquisition of permits from more than one level of government. Additionally, regional, state, tribal, or local laws and regulations may be more stringent than their federal counterparts. The existence of environmental laws at various levels of government also provide more opportunities for citizens’ suits or other forms of opposition to new developmental projects or the expansion of existing projects. These factors all have the potential to substantially restrict or delay project permitting, development, or expansion of projects and increase costs to the Partnership in the process. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K for further discussion on environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, including methane and other GHG emissions, ozone standards, site remediation; and other regulations relating to environmental protection.
Total Financial Impact of Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations
At this time, the ultimate financial impact of complying with U.S. environmental laws and regulations is indeterminable. Compliance obligations can result in significant costs associated with installing and maintaining pollution controls, fines and penalties resulting from any regulatory violations, and potential limitations on operations. Remediation obligations can result in significant costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contaminated facilities, and with damage claims arising from the contamination. The timing and complete extent of future expenditures related to environmental matters is difficult to estimate accurately because (1) interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing or evolving; (2) new claims can be brought against our existing or discontinued assets; (3) our pollution control and clean-up cost estimates may change, especially when our current estimates are based on preliminary site investigations or agreements; (4) new contaminated facilities and sites may be found, or what we know about existing sites and facilities could change; and (5) where there is potentially more than one responsible party involved in litigation, we cannot estimate our joint and several liability with certainty.
We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures costs, some of which could be material, as environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, change, and become stricter and more robust. Additional regulatory restrictions continue to be placed on activities that may have a detrimental effect on the environment. For this reason, new laws and regulations, amendments and reinterpretations, and stricter enforcement permitting programs result in compliance and remediation obligations that can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position now and in the future. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. 
Pipeline Safety Matters
Our gas pipeline systems are subject to federal pipeline safety statutes, such as the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the PSI Act), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, and Enforcement Act of 2006 (the PIPES Act), the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act), as well as regulations promulgated and administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. Pursuant to this act, PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing, among other things, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, public awareness, operation and maintenance procedures, operator qualification, minimum depth requirements and emergency procedures. Additionally, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain relatively higher risk areas, known as HCAs and moderate consequence areas (MCAs) along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture. The HCAs for gas pipelines are predicated on high-population areas, which may include Class 3 and Class 4 areas. An MCA for gas pipelines is also based on population totals in addition to the existence of certain principal, high-capacity roadways, but an MCA does not meet the relative higher population totals of an HCA and therefore are located outside of HCA coverages
Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will

not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on pipeline safety matters.
During 2016, PHMSA also proposed new rules and issued a Notice of Public Rule Making for natural gas transmission and gathering lines that would, if adopted, impose more stringent inspection, reporting, and integrity management requirements on operators. However, PHMSA has since decided to split its 2016 proposed rule, which has become known as the “gas mega rule,” into three separate rulemakings, focusing on (1) maximum allowable operating pressure, integrity assessments and non-high consequence areas known as moderate consequence areas; (2) repair criteria, safety features for pigging, inspections and corrosion control; and (3) gathering lines. The first of these three rulemakings, relating to onshore gas transmission pipelines, was published as a final rule on October 1, 2019, becomes effective on July 1, 2020, and imposes numerous requirements on such pipelines, including maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) reconfirmation, the assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs (including all MCAs and those Class 3 and Class 4 areas found not to be in HCAs) within 14 years of the publication date and at least once every 10 years thereafter, the reporting of exceedances of MAOP, and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. We are currently assessing the operational and financial impact related to this final rule which will become effective on July 1, 2020 with a 15-year implementation deadline. The remaining rulemakings comprising the gas mega rule are expected to be issued in 2020.
On July 31, 2018, PHMSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) requesting public comment on the additional safety measures pipelines facilities are required to take in response to class location changes due to population growth. The class location concept predates the extension of Integrity Management (IM) principles and it has been argued that public safety can be improved if IM measures are implemented as an alternative to pressure reductions, pipe replacements, or hydrostatic pressure testing. While this rulemaking process is expected to be lengthy, efforts to modernize the existing PHMSA regulations may have a material effect on costs.
On October 31, 2019, PHMSA released its “Enhanced Emergency Order Procedures” final rule, which replaces an interim final rule issued by PHMSA in 2016,and allows PHMSA to respond to imminent threats during natural disasters, and when serious flaws are discovered in pipes or in equipment manufacturing processes, or when an accident reveals an industry practice is unsafe. The final rule addressed comments made in response to the 2016 interim final rule, which resulted in several changes in the final rule. The Partnership is currently reviewing the final rule but does not expect any material issues in complying with the final rule, which took effect on December 2, 2019.
The Partnership expects new pipeline safety legislation to be proposed and finalized in 2020 that will reauthorize PHMSA pipeline safety programs, which expired under the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act at the end of September 2019. Any such new pipeline safety legislation could impose more stringent or costly compliance obligations on us and could require us to pursue additional capital projects or conduct integrity or maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in the Partnership incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our costs of transportation services as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The existing pipeline safety laws could cause our pipeline systems to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure their continued safe and reliable operation and to comply with the federal pipeline safety statutes and regulations. Additional rule makings regarding pipeline safety are likely and, despite compliance with applicable rules and regulations, our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures that could impact the surrounding population and environment. This may result in civil and/or criminal fines and penalties or third-party property damage claims and could require additional testing or upgrades on the pipeline system unrelated to the incident. It is possible that these costs may not be covered by insurance or recoverable through rate increases. There can be no assurance that future compliance with the requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our pipeline systems and the Partnership's financial position, operational costs, cash flow and our ability to maintain current distribution levels to the extent the increased costs are not recoverable through rates.
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
Our pipelines are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. The OSHA and analogous state agencies oversee the implementation of these laws and regulations. Additionally, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Historically, worker safety and health compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. While pipeline operators may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards, such increases in 

TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2019    25




costs of compliance, and the extent to which they might be recoverable through our pipeline’s rates, cannot be estimated at this time.
Cyber security
We rely on our information technology to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information pipeline operators use to safely operate our assets. We, our operators and other energy infrastructure companies in jurisdictions where we do business continue to face cyber security risks. Cyber security events could be directed against companies in the energy infrastructure industry.
A breach in the security of our information technology could expose our business to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of critical information and functions. This could affect our operations, damage our assets and result in safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, regulatory enforcement actions and potential litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations.
TC Energy, the indirect parent of our General Partner and the operator of most of our assets, has a cyber security strategy which aligns with industry and recognized standards for cyber security. This strategy includes cyber security risk assessments, preventions, continuous monitoring of networks and other information sources for threats to the organization, comprehensive incident response plans/processes and a cyber security awareness program for employees. Although TC Energy also has insurance which may cover losses from physical damage to our facilities as a result of a cyber security event, the insurance does not cover all events in all circumstances. There is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against these threats will be recovered through rates.
EMPLOYEES
We do not have any employees. We are managed and operated by our General Partner. Subsidiaries of TC Energy operate most of our pipelines systems pursuant to operating agreements, with the exception of the Iroquois pipeline system and the Joint Facilities. The Iroquois pipeline system is operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Iroquois. The Joint Facilities are operated by MNOC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MNE. MNE is a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc.
