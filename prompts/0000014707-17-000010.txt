ITEM 1 | BUSINESS

Caleres, Inc., originally founded as Brown Shoe Company in 1878 and incorporated in 1913, is a global footwear retailer and wholesaler with annual net sales of $2.6 billion. In May 2015, the shareholders of Brown Shoe Company, Inc. approved a rebranding initiative that changed the name of the company to Caleres, Inc. (the "Company"). Current activities include the operation of retail shoe stores and e-commerce websites as well as the design, sourcing and marketing of footwear for women and men. Our business is seasonal in nature due to consumer spending patterns, with higher back-to-school and Christmas season sales. Traditionally, the third fiscal quarter accounts for a substantial portion of our earnings for the year.
Our net sales are comprised of four major categories: women's footwear, men's footwear, children's footwear and accessories. The percentage of net sales attributable to each category is as follows: 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 
Women's footwear | 63 | % | 63 | % | 64 | %
Men's footwear | 22 | % | 23 | % | 22 | %
Children's footwear | 9 | % | 9 | % | 9 | %
Accessories | 6 | % | 5 | % | 5 | %

Approximately 67% of footwear sales in 2016 were retail sales, including sales through our e-commerce websites, compared to 66% in 2015 and 67% in 2014, while the remaining 33%, 34% and 33% in the respective years represented wholesale sales. 
Employees
We had approximately 12,000 full-time and part-time employees as of January 28, 2017. In the United States, there are no employees subject to union contracts. In Canada, we employ approximately 20 warehouse employees under a union contract, which expires in October 2019.
Competition
With many companies operating retail shoe stores and shoe departments, we compete in a highly fragmented market. Competitors include local, regional and national shoe store chains, department stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, numerous independent retail operators of various sizes and e-commerce businesses. Quality of products and services, store location, trend-right merchandise selection and availability of brands, pricing, advertising and consumer service are all factors that impact retail competition.
In addition, our wholesale customers sell shoes purchased from competing footwear suppliers. Those competing footwear suppliers own and license brands, many of which are well-known and marketed aggressively. Many retailers, who are our wholesale customers, source directly from factories or through agents. The wholesale footwear business has low barriers to entry, which further intensifies competition. 

FAMOUS FOOTWEAR

Our Famous Footwear segment includes our Famous Footwear stores and Famous.com, and included our Shoes.com subsidiary prior to its sale in December 2014, as further discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Famous Footwear is one of America’s leading family-branded footwear retailers with 1,055 stores at the end of 2016 and net sales of $1.6 billion in 2016. Our core consumers are women who seek leading national brands of casual, athletic and fashionable footwear at a value for themselves and their families. 
Famous Footwear stores feature a wide selection of brand-name athletic, casual and dress shoes for the entire family. Brands carried include, among others, Nike, Skechers, Converse, adidas, Vans, Asics, Sperry, New Balance, Bearpaw and Sof Sole, as well as company-owned and licensed brands including, among others, LifeStride, Dr. Scholl’s Shoes, Naturalizer, Fergalicious, Carlos by Carlos Santana and Circus by Sam Edelman. Our company-owned and licensed products are sold to our Famous Footwear segment by our Brand Portfolio segment at a profit and represent approximately 8% of the Famous Footwear segment's net sales. We work closely with our vendors to provide our consumers with fresh product and, in some cases, product exclusively designed for and available only in our stores. Famous Footwear’s average retail price is approximately $42 for footwear with retail price points typically ranging from $25 for shoes up to $220 for boots.

Famous Footwear stores are located in strip shopping centers as well as outlet and regional malls in all 50 states, Guam and Canada. The breakdown by venue at the end of each of the last three fiscal years is as follows:

 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 
Strip centers | 699 | 697 | 696 
Outlet malls | 190 | 189 | 183 
Regional malls | 166 | 160 | 159 
Total | 1,055 | 1,046 | 1,038

We expect to open approximately 40 new stores and close approximately 70 stores in 2017, as we continue to focus on store locations with a greater penetration of high-value consumers. New stores typically experience an initial start-up period characterized by lower sales and operating earnings than what is generally achieved by more mature stores. While the duration of this start-up period may vary by type of store, economic environment and geographic location, new stores typically reach a normal level of profitability within approximately four years.
Famous Footwear relies on merchandise allocation systems and processes that use allocation criteria, consumer segmentation and inventory data in an effort to ensure stores are adequately stocked with product and to differentiate the needs of each store based on location, consumer segmentation and other factors. Famous Footwear’s distribution systems allow for merchandise to be delivered to each store weekly, or on a more frequent basis, as needed. Famous Footwear also uses regional third-party pooled distribution sites across the country. 
Famous Footwear’s marketing programs include digital marketing and social media, national television, e-commerce advertising, print, cinema and in-store advertisements, all of which are designed to further develop and reinforce the Famous Footwear concept and strengthen our connection with consumers. We believe the success of our campaigns is attributable to highlighting key categories and tailoring the timing of such messaging to adapt to seasonal shopping patterns. In 2016, we spent approximately $52.5 million to advertise and market Famous Footwear to our target consumers, a portion of which was recovered from suppliers. In 2016, we integrated our high- value consumer strategy and our digital marketing efforts to include new experiences both in-store and online to drive cohesive messaging. Famous Footwear has an extensive loyalty program (“Rewards”), which informs and rewards frequent consumers with product previews, earned incentives based upon purchase continuity and other periodic promotional offers. In 2016, approximately 75% of our Famous Footwear net sales were generated by our Rewards members compared to 74% in 2015. During the year, we expanded our efforts to connect with and engage our consumers to build a strong brand preference for Famous Footwear through both our loyalty program and social media. In 2016, we grew our mobile application and had more than one million members enrolled by the end of the year. In 2017, we will continue to intensify our digital marketing presence to acquire and retain highly valuable consumers. 
As part of our omni-channel approach to reach consumers, we also operate Famous.com, which offers an expanded product assortment beyond what is sold in Famous Footwear stores. Accessible via desktop, tablet and mobile devices, Famous.com helps consumers explore product assortments, including items available in local stores, and make purchases. In 2015, we expanded our in-store fulfillment initiative to increase product selection and reduce the average delivery time for direct-to-consumer purchases, which we believe contributed to the significant increase in Famous.com sales in 2016. Famous.com also allows Rewards members to view their points status and purchase history, manage profile settings and engage further with the brand. Famous Footwear’s mobile app further serves as a hub for Rewards members to shop, find local stores, redeem Rewards certificates, and learn about the newest products, latest trends and hottest deals. 
In 2016, we invested in our logistics network to meet the omni-channel demands of today, including faster order processing and faster delivery to our customers, as well as to prepare for ongoing growth in our business. The expansion and modernization projects at our distribution centers, which were completed in the second half of 2016, are providing additional shipping flexibility, operational efficiencies and an expansion of our logistics infrastructure capacity. 
Until December 2014, we owned and operated Shoes.com, Inc., a pure-play Internet retailing company. Shoes.com offered a diverse selection of footwear and accessories for women, men and children, including footwear purchased from third-party suppliers and the Company's other brands. As further discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, we sold Shoes.com in December 2014 and recognized a gain on sale of $4.7 million.

BRAND PORTFOLIO

Our Brand Portfolio segment offers retailers and consumers a portfolio of leading brands from our Healthy Living and Contemporary Fashion platforms by designing, sourcing and marketing branded footwear for women and men at a variety of price points. Certain of our branded footwear products are sold under brand names that are owned by the Company and others are developed pursuant to licensing 
5

agreements. Our Brand Portfolio segment sells footwear on a wholesale basis to retailers. The segment also sells footwear through our branded retail stores and e-commerce businesses. In 2016, we expanded our men's business with the acquisition of Allen Edmonds, as further discussed in the Portfolio of Brands section below and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Portfolio of Brands
The following is a listing of our principal brands and licensed products:

Sam Edelman footwear is sold primarily at online retailers and catalogs, national chains, department stores, mass merchants and independent retailers at suggested retail price points of $40 for shoes to $378 for boots.
Allen Edmonds: In December 2016, we acquired Allen Edmonds to increase our exposure in men’s footwear, solidifying a new revenue stream to drive overall growth. Allen Edmonds, founded in 1922, is a U.S.-based retailer and wholesaler of premium men’s footwear, apparel, leather goods and accessories with a strong manufacturing heritage. Allen Edmonds’ famous Goodyear welted shoes are handcrafted in Port Washington, Wisconsin using a 212-step production process.

We have a license agreement with Santana Tesoro, LLC to sell Carlos by Carlos Santana footwear that expires in December 2017, with extension options through December 2020.
Via Spiga:  Established in 1985, Via Spiga is named after the main street in one of the most famed shopping districts in Milan, Italy.  Via Spiga delivers sleek and architecturally-inspired styles, bringing luxury within reach.  The collection has a feel of amped-up femininity for women who like to command attention.

The brand is primarily sold in premier department stores, national chains and online at suggested retail price points from $195 for shoes to $495 for boots.

The line takes inspiration from two key elements of George Brown’s legacy - the boots he built for the United States Army during World War I and his farming and hunting boots. George Brown Bilt is a modern men’s brand that echoes our founder’s commitment to innovation, hard work and the American dream of building something from nothing. The brand is primarily sold at national chains, online and department stores at suggested retail price points ranging from $250 for shoes to $495 for boots. 
Wholesale
Within our Brand Portfolio segment, footwear is distributed on a wholesale basis to over 1,900 retailers, including national chains, online retailers, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs throughout the United States and Canada, as well as approximately 62 other countries (including sales to our retail operations). Our most significant wholesale customers include Famous Footwear and many of the nation’s largest retailers including national chains such as DSW, TJX Corporation (including TJ Maxx and Marshalls), Nordstrom Rack and Ross; online retailers such as Nordstrom.com, Zappos.com and Amazon.com; department stores such as Nordstrom, Macy’s, Dillard's and Bloomingdale's; mass merchandisers such as Walmart and Target; and independent retailers such as QVC and Home Shopping Network. We also sell product to a variety of international retail customers and distributors. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material negative impact on our Brand Portfolio segment and the Company.
Our Brand Portfolio segment sold approximately 46 million pairs of shoes on a wholesale basis during 2016. We sell footwear to wholesale customers on both a landed and a first-cost basis. Landed sales are those in which we obtain title to the footwear from our overseas suppliers and maintain title until the footwear clears United States customs and is shipped to our wholesale customers. Landed sales generally carry a higher profit rate than first-cost sales as a result of the brand equity associated with the product along with the additional customs, warehousing and logistics services provided to customers and the risks associated with inventory ownership. To allow for the prompt shipment on reorders, we carry inventories of certain styles. First-cost sales are those in which we obtain title to footwear from our overseas suppliers and typically relinquish title to customers at a designated overseas port. Many of these customers then import this product into the United States.
Products sold under license agreements accounted for approximately 26% of the sales of the Brand Portfolio segment in 2016 and 2014, and 27% of the segment's sales in 2015. Caleres also receives royalty revenues for licensing owned brands, including certain brands listed above, to third parties.

Retail
Our Brand Portfolio segment also includes retail stores for certain brands, including Naturalizer, Allen Edmonds and Sam Edelman. The number of our Brand Portfolio retail stores at the end of the last three fiscal years was as follows:

 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
Naturalizer | 153 | 159 | 169 
Allen Edmonds | 69 | N/A | N/A 
Sam Edelman | 12 | 6 | 2 
Total | 234 | 165 | 171 

At the end of 2016, we operated 85 Naturalizer stores in Canada, 67 Naturalizer stores in the United States and one Naturalizer store in Guam. Of the 153 Naturalizer stores, approximately 49% are concept stores primarily located in regional malls and average approximately 1,200 square feet in size. The other 51% of stores are located in outlet malls and average approximately 2,300 square feet in size. Total Naturalizer store square footage at the end of 2016 was approximately 272,000 compared to 280,000 in 2015. During 2016, we acquired 68 Allen Edmonds stores in the United States and one store in Italy, with total square footage of 106,775. We operated 12 Sam Edelman stores at the end of 2016. During 2017, we expect to open four Naturalizer stores, 10 Allen Edmonds stores and one Sam Edelman store and close 11 Naturalizer stores and one Allen Edmonds store. 
In connection with our omni-channel approach to reach consumers, we also operate Naturalizer.com, Naturalizer.ca, AllenEdmonds.com, SamEdelman.com, DrSchollsShoes.com, Ryka.com, LifeStride.com, ViaSpiga.com, FrancoSarto.com, CarlosShoes.com, FergieShoes.com and GeorgeBrownBilt.com, which offer substantially the same product selection to consumers as we sell to our retail partners. Vince.com and DVF.com complement our distribution of those brands.
References to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites and the information contained on the websites is not part of this report. 
Marketing
We continue to build on the recognition of our portfolio of brands to create differentiation and consumer loyalty. Our marketing teams are responsible for the development and implementation of marketing programs for each brand, both for us and for our retail partners. In 2016, we spent approximately $22.1 million in advertising and marketing support for our Brand Portfolio segment, including digital marketing and social media, consumer media advertising, trade shows, print, production, public relations and in-store displays and fixtures. The marketing teams are also responsible for driving the development of branding and content for our brand websites. We continually focus on enhancing the effectiveness of these marketing efforts through market research, product development and marketing communications that collectively address the ever-changing lives and needs of our consumers. In 2016, the marketing teams were instrumental in driving record-setting sales on the brand’s websites and executing new product launches, by branding, positioning and marketing to both the consumer and trade audiences. In 2017, we will seek to continue driving consumer engagement and revenue-strengthening business with our key customers and increase market share by targeting new audiences and growth areas, with particular emphasis on awareness, engagement and acquisition in the digital space.
Sourcing and Product Development Operations
Our sourcing and product development operations source and develop footwear for our Brand Portfolio segment and also a portion of the footwear sold by our Famous Footwear segment. We have sourcing and product development offices in St. Louis, China, New York, Port Washington, Italy, Macau, Vietnam, Hong Kong and Ethiopia.
Sourcing Operations
In 2016, the sourcing operations sourced approximately 46 million pairs of shoes through a global network of third-party independent footwear manufacturers. The majority of our footwear sourced is provided by approximately 54 manufacturers operating approximately 78 manufacturing facilities. In certain countries, we use agents to facilitate and manage the development, production and shipment of product. We attribute our ability to achieve consistent quality, competitive prices and on-time delivery to the breadth of these established relationships. While we generally do not have significant contractual commitments with our suppliers, we do enter into sourcing agreements with certain independent sourcing agents. Prior to production, we monitor the quality of all of our footwear components and also inspect the prototypes of each footwear style. 
8

In 2016, approximately 74% of the footwear we sourced was from manufacturing facilities in China. The following table provides an overview of our sourcing in 2016:

Country | Millions of Pairs
China | 33.7 
Vietnam | 9.5 
Ethiopia | 1.3 
Other | 1.3 
Total | 45.8 

Product Development Operations
In our Dongguan, China office, we operate a sample-making facility that allows us to have greater control over our product development in terms of accuracy, execution and speed-to-market. We maintain design and product development teams for our brands in St. Louis, China, New York, and Port Washington as well as other select fashion locations, including Italy. These teams, which include independent designers, are responsible for the creation and development of new product styles. Our designers monitor trends in fashion footwear and apparel and work closely with retailers to identify consumer footwear preferences. Our design teams create collections of footwear and work closely with our product development and sourcing offices to convert our designs into new footwear styles.
Our long-range plans include further expansion into new markets outside of China, developing more progressive processes to improve factory capacity and material planning, and continuing to drive excellence in product value and execution in a continually evolving manufacturing landscape.
Backlog
At January 28, 2017, our Brand Portfolio segment had a backlog of unfilled wholesale orders of approximately $263.1 million compared to $274.4 million on January 30, 2016. Most orders are for delivery within the next 90 to 120 days, and although orders are subject to cancellation, we have not experienced significant cancellations in the past. The backlog at any particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, the continuing trend among customers to reduce the lead time on their orders, capacity shifts at foreign manufacturers and the volume of e-commerce drop ship orders that are received immediately rather than in advance. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments or the growth rate of sales from one period to the next.
