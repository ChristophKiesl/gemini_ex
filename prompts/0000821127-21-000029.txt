ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
I.    General 
Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “BPFH,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), a Massachusetts corporation, is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and the holding company (the “Holding Company”) of Boston Private Bank & Trust Company (the “Bank” or “Boston Private Bank”), a Massachusetts trust company whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).
We offer a full range of banking and wealth management services to high net worth individuals, families, businesses, and select institutions through a financial umbrella that helps to preserve, grow, and transfer assets over the financial lifetime of a client through our two reportable segments: (i) Private Banking; and (ii) Wealth Management and Trust. Each reportable segment reflects the services provided by the Company to a distinct segment of the wealth management market as described below.
As previously announced on January 4, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with SVB Financial Group ("SVB") pursuant to which SVB will acquire the Company. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both companies' Boards of Directors and is expected to close in mid-2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of customary regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of the Company.
Private Banking
The Private Banking segment is comprised of the banking operations of Boston Private Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Boston Private Bank primarily operates in three geographic markets: New England, Northern California, and Southern California. The Private Banking segment is principally engaged in providing banking services to high net worth individuals, privately-owned businesses and partnerships, and nonprofit organizations. In addition, the Private Banking segment is an active provider of financing for affordable housing, first-time homebuyers, economic development, social services, community revitalization and small businesses.
Wealth Management and Trust
The Wealth Management and Trust segment is comprised of Boston Private Wealth LLC (“Boston Private Wealth”), a registered investment adviser (“RIA”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, and the trust operations of Boston Private Bank. The Wealth Management and Trust segment offers planning-based financial strategies, wealth management, family office, financial planning, tax planning, and trust services to individuals, families, institutions, and nonprofit institutions. On September 1, 2019, KLS Professional Advisors Group, LLC (“KLS”) merged with and into Boston Private Wealth. The results of KLS previously were reported in a third reportable segment “Affiliate Partners” as further discussed below. The Wealth Management and Trust segment operates in New England, New York, Southeast Florida, Northern California, and Southern California.
Prior to the third quarter of 2019, we had three reportable segments: Affiliate Partners, Private Banking, and Wealth Management and Trust. For the first two quarters of 2019, the Affiliate Partners segment was comprised of two subsidiaries of the Company: KLS and Dalton, Greiner, Hartman, Maher & Co., LLC (“DGHM”), each of which were (and in the case of DGHM, remain) RIAs. Prior to the first quarter of 2019, the Affiliate Partners segment also included Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC (“Anchor”) and Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, LLC (“BOS”). The Company completed the sale of its ownership interests in Anchor and BOS in 2018 as described below under “Asset Sales and Divestitures.” With the integration of KLS into Boston Private Wealth, the Company reorganized its segment reporting structure to align with how the Company's financial performance and strategy is reviewed and managed. The results of KLS are now included in the results of Boston Private Wealth within the Wealth Management and Trust segment, as described above, and the results of DGHM are now included within the Holding Company and Eliminations segment.
For revenue, net income, assets, and other financial information for each of the Company’s reportable segments, see Part II. Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20: Reportable Segments.”

II.    Divestitures
On December 3, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interest in BOS to the management team of BOS for an upfront cash payment and an eight-year revenue sharing agreement with BOS. The present value of the estimated proceeds from the revenue sharing agreement was included in the gain on sale of BOS in the fourth quarter of 2018. Changes to the amount of actual proceeds from the revenue sharing agreement will result in future positive or negative revenue adjustments. The Company recorded a favorable valuation adjustment of $0.9 million and $1.1 million on the revenue sharing agreement in the third quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019, respectively.
On April 13, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Anchor to the management team of Anchor for an upfront cash payment and future payments that had a net present value of $15.4 million at the time of closing.
In December 2009, the Company divested its interest in Westfield Capital Management Company, LP, formerly known as Westfield Capital Management Company, LLC ("Westfield").
For further details relating to the Company’s divestitures, see Part II. Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3: Divestitures.”
III.    Competition
The Company operates in the highly competitive financial services marketplace. The Bank encounters competition from larger national and regional commercial banking organizations, savings banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions and non-bank financial services and financial technology companies, which may offer lower interest rates on loans and higher interest rates on deposits. The Bank’s competitors also include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations, mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns, and invest more in technology. To compete effectively, the Bank relies on personal contacts by officers and employees; customized service; and the Bank’s reputation within the communities that it serves.
Boston Private Wealth and DGHM compete with a wide variety of firms, including national and regional financial services firms, commercial banks and trust companies, mutual fund companies, investment advisory firms, stock brokerage firms, accounting firms, law firms, and digital advice platforms, which may offer lower fee services. Investment advisers that emphasize passive products have gained, and may continue to gain, market share from active managers like us, which could have a material impact on our business. The RIAs’ ability to compete is dependent upon their respective quality and level of service, personal relationships, the marketing and distribution of investment products, and investment performance. 
IV.    Employees and Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, the Company had 804 employees. The Company’s employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company believes its employee relations are good.
We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs.
The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we were able to transition, over a short period of time, our employees to effectively working from remote locations and ensure a safely-distanced working environment for employees performing customer facing activities at branches and in operations centers. All employees are asked not to come to work when they experience signs or symptoms of a possible COVID-19 illness and have been provided additional paid time off to cover compensation during such absences. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our employees by strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, managing the employee portion of health care premiums to a minimum and sponsoring various wellness programs. 
We believe our commitment to adhering to our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our employees’ well-being, supporting our employees’ career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in the retention of our top-performing employees.
V. Supervision and Regulation 
The following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. This regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect the safety and soundness of depository institutions, the federal deposit insurance system, and depositors, rather than the shareholders of a bank holding company such as the Company. 
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) under the BHCA. The Company is also subject to supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks (the “Commissioner”) under Massachusetts law. As a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and Federal Reserve member bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve. The Bank’s California offices are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (the “DFPI”). 
The RIAs are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, the Department of Labor, and state securities regulators.
The following is a summary of certain aspects of the various statutes and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. This summary is not a comprehensive analysis of all applicable laws, and is qualified by reference to the full text of statutes and regulations referenced below.
The CARES Act and Pandemic Response
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, substantial disruptions to the global economy and to the customers and communities that we serve. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") was enacted on March 27, 2020 to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the establishment of the Small Business Administration’s (the “SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). Additionally, on December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the "Economic Aid Act") was enacted which, among other items, provides for a second round of PPP loans ("PPP-2"). The Company is also participating in the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program, established to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, the Company implemented business continuity contingency plans, including company-wide remote working arrangements. We will continue to evaluate this fluid situation and take additional actions as necessary. 
Participation in the PPP. The CARES Act initially appropriated $349 billion for “paycheck protection loans” through the PPP. The amount appropriated was subsequently increased to $659 billion (the "Original PPP"). The CARES Act provided funding to the SBA for use for the PPP. Under the terms of the PPP, certain businesses can apply for loans through qualified financial institutions, such as the Bank, based on eligibility criteria. The PPP provides loans to eligible businesses with an initial term of up to five years at an interest rate of 1.0%. Loans issued under the PPP will be forgiven if the borrower uses at least 60% of the proceeds on payroll costs and other eligible costs such as utilities or rent for a period of up to 24 weeks, following the loan funding date. These conditions were changed from 75% and 8 weeks by the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act signed into law on June 5, 2020. The SBA has issued an interim final rule in which it has provided that a lender may rely on certifications made by a borrower to determine the borrower’s eligibility for a PPP loan and use of loan proceeds, subject to a good faith review, and to determine the qualifying loan amount and eligibility for loan forgiveness.
Loans issued by participating financial institutions are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. Banks will receive a processing fee from the SBA from 1.0% to 5.0% based on the size of the loan. Loans up to $350 thousand will have a 5.0% fee, loans between $350 thousand and $2.0 million will have a 3.0% fee, and loans greater than $2.0 million will have a 1.0% fee.
In conjunction with the PPP, the Federal Reserve has created a lending facility for qualified financial institutions. The Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (the “PPPLF”) will extend credit to depository institutions with a term of up to five years at an interest rate of 0.35%. Only loans issued under the PPP can be pledged as collateral to access the PPPLF. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank has not participated in the PPPLF.
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank processed 1,045 loans totaling $380.5 million under the Original PPP, primarily in the second quarter of 2020. The Bank has received $10.9 million in processing fees from the SBA, which is netted against the principal balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be accreted through Net interest income on a straight-line basis over the life of the loan. If a loan is forgiven or otherwise paid off, the remainder of the processing fee will be accreted through Net interest income. As of December 31, 2020, the balance of PPP loans was $312.4 million, and $5.1 million was accreted through Net interest income. Additionally, the Bank has been participating in the PPP-2 as of January 29, 2021.
Mortgage deferment program. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank initiated a mortgage deferment program under which principal and interest payments on qualifying loans are generally deferred for initially three months and the loan term is extended three months; if requested, the loan may be deferred for a subsequent three months. Loans that are deferred under the program are not considered troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") or past due based on current regulatory guidance. In total, approximately 365 Residential mortgages and Home equity loans totaling approximately $220.0 million have been processed under the program. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for approximately 300 loans totaling approximately $200.0 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while approximately 40 loans totaling approximately $15.0 million remain in deferral under the program. Approximately 25 loans totaling approximately $5.0 million are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020 after the deferral expired, primarily First Time Home Buyer loans.
Commercial and industrial loan deferment program. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank initiated a program offering qualified Commercial and industrial borrowers principal payment deferral for six months, with the deferred principal added to the last payment. In total, approximately 85 Commercial and industrial loans totaling approximately $125.0 million have been processed under the program. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for approximately 80 loans totaling approximately $115.0 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while approximately five loans totaling approximately $10.0 million remain in deferral under the program. Of the loans that came off deferral, no loans are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020.
Commercial real estate second loan program. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank also initiated a program to offer qualifying Commercial real estate borrowers a second mortgage to cover up to one year of principal and interest payments. In order to qualify for the loan, the total exposure after receiving the second mortgage for each borrower could not exceed a 75% loan-to-value ratio, and the loans were required to be current at the time of application, amongst other conditions. In total, borrowers with approximately 240 existing loans totaling $1.3 billion requested and were approved for these second mortgages, representing approximately 50% of the Commercial real estate loan balance. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowers associated with the $1.3 billion of existing loans had an outstanding balance of approximately $72.0 million. The Company does not anticipate a material increase in the program balance of new loans in the future, and the principal balance will amortize down over the life of the loan, generally five years. In addition to, and outside of the Commercial real estate second loan program, the Bank offered qualified Commercial real estate borrowers principal payment deferral for up to 12 months, with the deferred principal added to the balance due at maturity. In total, 13 Commercial real estate borrowers with loans totaling $49.0 million accepted this accommodation. As of December 31, 2020, deferrals for 10 borrowers with loans totaling $40.3 million have expired with the loans returning to payment, while 3 borrowers with loans totaling approximately $8.7 million remain in deferral. Of the loans that came off deferral, no loans are delinquent on payment terms as of December 31, 2020. The entire Commercial real estate portfolio will continue to be monitored for credit deterioration regardless of their participation in the plan. 
Regulation of the Company
The Company is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve, which has the authority, among other things: to order bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices; to assess civil money penalties; and to order termination of non-banking activities or termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company.
Source of Strength. Under the BHCA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Company is required to serve as a source of financial strength for the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company may not have the resources to provide support to the Bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 
Acquisitions and Activities. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank; acquiring control of a bank; merging or consolidating with another bank holding company; or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company. 
The BHCA also generally prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks. However, among other permitted activities, a bank holding company may engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks, subject to certain notification requirements. 
Limitations on Acquisitions of Company Common Stock. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under rebuttable presumptions of control established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of control of voting securities of a bank holding company constitutes an acquisition of control under the Change in Bank Control 
Act, requiring prior notice to the Federal Reserve, if, immediately after the transaction, the acquiring person (or persons acting in concert) will own, control, or hold with power to vote, 10% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company, and if either (i) the bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or (ii) no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.
In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve. Among other circumstances, under the BHCA, a company has control of a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote, 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company; controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company; or the Federal Reserve has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company. The Federal Reserve has established presumptions of control under which the acquisition of control of 5% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company, together with other factors enumerated by the Federal Reserve, could constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA.
Regulation of the Bank
The Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination by the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve, and with respect to its California offices, the DFPI. The Bank is also subject to regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), as enforced by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may also directly examine the other subsidiaries of the Company. The enforcement powers available to federal and state banking regulators include, among other things, the ability to issue cease and desist or removal orders, to terminate insurance of deposits, to assess civil money penalties, to issue directives to increase capital, to place the bank into receivership, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. 
Deposit Insurance. Deposit obligations of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor for deposits held in the same right and capacity. In 2016, as mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), the FDIC’s Board of Directors approved a final rule to increase the DIF’s reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.36%. Small banks, which are generally banks with less than $10 billion in assets, were awarded assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. In January 2019, the Bank received notification from the FDIC that it was eligible for small bank assessment credits of $2.0 million. Credits were applied on the September 30, 2019, December 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020 invoices. The full $2.0 million of credits has been exhausted.
Deposit insurance premiums are based on assets. In 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years. Under this method, each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS composite ratings are multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products is added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating). This method takes into account various measures, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one-year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets, and considerations related to asset quality. For 2020, the FDIC insurance expense for the Bank was $2.6 million.
The FDIC has the authority to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time. In addition, under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that: the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices; is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations; or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
Acquisitions and Branching. Prior approval from the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve is required in order for the Bank to acquire another bank or establish a new branch office. Well capitalized and well managed banks may acquire other banks in any state, subject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes a state-chartered bank, such as the Bank, to establish new branch offices on an interstate basis to the same extent a bank chartered by the host state may establish branch offices.
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. The FDIA generally limits the types of equity investments that FDIC-insured state-chartered member banks, such as the Bank, may make and the kinds of activities in which such banks may engage, as a principal, to those that are permissible for national banks. Further, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) permits state banks, to the extent permitted under state law, to engage - through “financial subsidiaries” - in certain activities which are permissible for subsidiaries of a financial holding company. In order to form a financial subsidiary, 
a state-chartered bank must be well capitalized, and must comply with certain capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules, among other requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Act provides that state member banks are subject to the same restrictions with respect to purchasing, selling, underwriting, and holding of investment securities as national banks.
Lending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, and persons or companies that own, control or have power to vote more than 10% of any class of securities of a bank or an affiliate of a bank, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. 
Brokered Deposits. The FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total assets are subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. However, for institutions that are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered deposits. Section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), which was enacted in 2018, amends the FDIA to exempt a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions. 
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the Federal Reserve to evaluate the Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operations, and to take this record into consideration when evaluating certain applications. The Federal Reserve’s CRA regulations are generally based upon objective criteria of the performance of institutions under three key assessment tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branch offices, ATMs, and other offices. The Bank’s most recent performance evaluation from the Federal Reserve was an “outstanding” rating. Massachusetts has also enacted a similar statute that requires the Commissioner to evaluate the performance of the Bank in helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community and to take that record into account in considering certain applications.
Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness 
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet. The Federal Reserve may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
The capital adequacy guidelines define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common equity Tier 1 capital, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus, and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 capital, less certain deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital. Prior to the effectiveness of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies were permitted to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock in Tier 1 capital, subject to limitations. However, the Federal Reserve’s capital rule applicable to bank holding companies permanently grandfathered non-qualifying capital instruments, including trust preferred securities, issued before May 19, 2010 by depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. In addition, under rules that became effective January 1, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive income (positive or negative) must be reflected in Tier 1 capital; however, the Company and the Bank were permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. The Company and the Bank have made this election.
Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative credit risk. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average assets less certain items such as goodwill and intangible assets, as permitted under the capital rules.
Under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a minimum total Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Additionally, these rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions of more than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. 
Under the Federal Reserve’s rules, a Federal Reserve supervised institution, such as the Bank, is considered well capitalized if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. The Bank is currently considered well capitalized under all regulatory definitions.
Generally, a bank, upon receiving notice that it is not adequately capitalized (i.e., that it is “undercapitalized”), becomes subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA that, for example, (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that its federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions, and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days.
Current capital rules do not establish standards for determining whether a bank holding company is well capitalized. However, for purposes of processing regulatory applications and notices, the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y provides that a bank holding company is considered “well capitalized” if: (i) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; (ii) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater; and (iii) the bank holding company is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. A banking organization that qualifies for and elects to use the community bank leverage framework described below will be considered well capitalized as long as it is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
Section 201 of the Economic Growth Act directs the federal bank regulatory agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible capital to average total consolidated assets of not less than 8.0% or more than 10.0%. Under the final rule issued by federal banking agencies, effective January 1, 2020, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio (equal to Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets) of greater than 9.0%, will be eligible to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework. A community banking organization that elects to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the banking agencies’ generally applicable capital rules and, if applicable, will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The final rule includes a two-quarter grace period during which a qualifying banking organization that temporarily fails to meet any of the qualifying criteria, including the greater than 9.0% leverage ratio requirement, generally would still be deemed well-capitalized so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage ratio greater than 8.0%. At the end of the grace period, the banking organization must meet all qualifying criteria to remain in the community bank leverage ratio framework or otherwise must comply with and report under the generally applicable rule. As required by Section 4012 of the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies temporarily lowered the community bank leverage ratio, issuing two interim final rules to set the community bank leverage ratio at 8.0% and then gradually re-establish it at 9.0%. Under the interim final rules, the community bank leverage ratio was set at 8.0% beginning in the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year. Community banks that have a leverage ratio of 8.0% or greater and meet certain other criteria may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework. Beginning in 2021, the community bank leverage ratio will increase to 8.5% for the calendar year. Community banks will have until January 1, 2022, before the leverage ratio requirement to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework will return to 9.0%. At this time, the Company does not anticipate opting in to the community bank leverage ratio. 
Safety and Soundness Standards. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the FDIA establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order restricting asset growth, requiring an institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets or directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness - Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 
Dividend Restrictions
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The revenue of the Company (on a parent-only basis) is derived primarily from dividends paid to it by the Bank. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries through the payment of dividends or otherwise is subject to the prior claims of creditors of its subsidiaries, including, with respect to the Bank, depositors of the Bank, except to the extent that certain claims of the Company in a creditor capacity may be recognized.
Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain capital above the capital conservation buffer. See “Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness - Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
Restrictions on Bank Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro-forma basis. In addition, a state member bank may not declare or pay a dividend: (i) if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the bank’s net income during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years; or (ii) that would exceed its undivided profits; in either case, unless the dividend has been approved by the Federal Reserve. The payment of dividends by a bank is also restricted pursuant to various state regulatory limitations.
Certain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with their Affiliates
There are various statutory restrictions on the extent to which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. An insured depository institution (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in covered transactions with, its non-depository institution affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction exceeds the following limits: (i) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution; and (ii) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include: a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by the Federal Reserve; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate; securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate; or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate. Covered transactions are also subject to certain collateral security requirements. Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and a bank holding company must be conducted under terms and conditions, including credit standards, that are at least as favorable to the bank as prevailing market terms. If a banking organization elects to use the community bank leverage ratio framework described in “Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness - Regulatory Capital Requirements” above, the banking organization would be required to measure the amount of covered transactions as a percentage of Tier 1 capital, subject to certain adjustments. Moreover, Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 provides that, to further competition, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or the furnishing of any service.
Consumer Protection Regulation
The Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive business practices, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Ownership Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), the GLBA, the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with clients when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Further, the CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The Federal Reserve examines the Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforces CFPB rules with respect to the Bank.
Mortgage Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes certain standards that mortgage lenders must consider before making a Residential mortgage loan, including verifying a borrower’s ability to repay such mortgage loan, and allows borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of TILA as a defense to foreclosure proceedings. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, prepayment penalties are prohibited for certain mortgage transactions and creditors are prohibited from financing insurance policies in connection with a Residential mortgage loan or Home equity line of credit. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage originators from receiving compensation based on the terms of Residential mortgage loans and generally limits the ability of a mortgage originator to be compensated by others if compensation is received from a consumer. The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to make additional disclosures prior to the extension of credit, and in each billing statement, for negative amortization loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. 
Privacy and Customer Information Security. The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. In general, the Bank must provide its clients with an initial and annual disclosure that explains its policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required or permitted by law, the Bank is prohibited from disclosing such information unless otherwise provided in such policies and procedures. However, an annual disclosure is not required to be provided by a financial institution if the financial institution only discloses information under exceptions from GLBA that do not require an opt out to be provided and if there has been no change in its privacy policies and procedures since its most recent disclosure provided to consumers. The GLBA also requires that the Bank develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of client information (as defined under GLBA), to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any client. The Bank is also required to send a notice to clients whose “sensitive information” has been compromised if unauthorized use of the information is “reasonably possible.” Most states, including the 
states in which the Bank operates, have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and the duties of the Bank in response to a data breach. In addition, Massachusetts has promulgated data security regulations with respect to personal information of Massachusetts residents. Pursuant to the FACT Act, the Bank has developed and implemented a written identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and method to opt out of the making of such solicitations. 
Anti-Money Laundering 
The Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report to the U.S. Treasury any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for any transaction or series of transactions that involve at least $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), which amended the BSA, together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies, has caused financial institutions, such as the Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency transaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. In evaluating an application to acquire a bank or to merge banks or effect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities, the applicable federal banking regulator must consider the anti-money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the target. In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are required to take steps to monitor their correspondent banking and private banking relationships as well as, if applicable, their relationships with “shell banks.” 
OFAC. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or other transactions relating to a sanctioned country, or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on certain transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, setoff or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company.
Regulation of Other Activities 
Registered Investment Advisers; ERISA. The Company conducts its investment advisory business through Boston Private Wealth and DGHM, each an investment adviser registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on RIAs, including compliance with the anti-fraud provisions of the Advisers Act and fiduciary duties arising out of those provisions. The duties and provisions impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our clients and our investments, including, for example, restrictions on transactions with our affiliates. Our investment advisers are subject to periodic SEC examinations. Our investment advisers are also subject to other requirements under the Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit advisory clients. These additional requirements relate to matters including maintaining effective and comprehensive compliance programs, recordkeeping and reporting and disclosure requirements. The Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to study the standard of care for brokers and investment advisers and report its findings to Congress. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act permits the SEC to impose a uniform standard of care on brokers and investment advisers based on the study’s findings. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC must also harmonize the enforcement of fiduciary standard violations under the Exchange Act and the Advisers Act. It is unclear how the studies and rulemaking relating to the fiduciary duties of brokers and investment advisers will affect the Company and the RIAs.
Each of the mutual funds for which DGHM acts as sub-adviser is an investment company registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Shares of each such fund are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the shares of each fund are qualified for sale (or exempt from such qualification) under the laws of each state and the District of Columbia to the extent such shares are sold in any of such jurisdictions. 
As a sub-adviser to registered investment companies, DGHM is subject to requirements under the 1940 Act and related SEC regulations, which limit such funds’ ability to enter into certain transactions with us or our affiliates. In addition, under provisions of the 1940 Act and Advisers Act governing advisory contracts, an assignment terminating a contract with an RIA can occur as a result of the acquisition of that RIA by another company.
The Company, the Bank, and their respective subsidiaries are also subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they are a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain of their clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) with such plans. 
The foregoing laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict certain subsidiaries of the Company from conducting their business in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed in the event of such noncompliance include: the suspension of individual employees; limitations on business activities for specified periods of time; the revocation of registration as an investment adviser, commodity trading adviser and/or other registrations; and other censures and fines. 
VI. Taxation
Federal Taxation
The Company and its incorporated affiliates are subject to federal income taxation generally applicable to corporations under the Code. In addition, the Bank is subject to Subchapter H of the Code, which provides specific rules for the treatment of securities, reserves for loan losses, and any common trust funds. 
The Company and its incorporated affiliates are members of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code and file a consolidated federal income tax return. Some of the advantages of filing a consolidated tax return include the avoidance of tax on intercompany distributions and the ability to offset operating and capital losses of one company against operating income and capital gains of another company. 
The Company’s taxable income includes its share of the taxable income or loss from its subsidiaries that are limited liability companies.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminated the exemption for performance-based executive compensation. 
State and Local Taxation
The Company and its affiliates are subject to the tax rate established in the states and certain municipalities in which they do business. Substantially all of the Company’s taxable state and local income is derived from Massachusetts, California, Florida, New York, and the City of New York. 
The Massachusetts tax rate is 9.0% on taxable income apportioned to Massachusetts. Massachusetts’ taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include a deduction for 95% of dividends received from entities in which the Company owns 15% or more of the voting stock, income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations. 
The California tax rate is 8.84% for corporations that are not financial institutions and 10.84% for financial institutions. The California tax is on California taxable income, which is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
The Florida tax rate is 5.5% on taxable income apportioned to Florida. Florida’s taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
The New York state tax rate is 6.5% on taxable income apportioned to New York (subject to alternative minimum taxes that may be based on business capital or a fixed dollar minimum), plus a surcharge for business operations in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation district. New York taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
The New York City tax rate is 8.85% on taxable income apportioned to New York City (subject to alternative minimum taxes that may be based on business capital or a fixed dollar minimum). New York City taxable income is defined as federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. These modifications include income from federally tax-exempt obligations and deductions for certain expenses allocated to federally tax-exempt obligations.
