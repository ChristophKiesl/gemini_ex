Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.
Company History
 
On October 18, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 14,375,000 units. Each unit (“Unit”) consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one Warrant, with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one ordinary share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $143,750,000.
 
Concurrent with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of (i) an aggregate of 4,950,000 warrants (the “Sponsor Private Placement Warrants”) to Rose Hill Sponsor LLC at a purchase price of $1.25 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,187,500, and (ii) an aggregate of 345,000 warrants (the “CCM Private Placement Warrants”) to J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC at a purchase price of $1.25 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $431,250. In addition, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 805,000 warrants (the “UW Private Placement Warrants” and together with the Sponsor Private Placement Warrants and the CCM Private Placement Warrants, the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Cantor at a purchase price of $1.25 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $1,006,250.
 
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants are, so long as the Sponsor, J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC, or Cantor or their permitted transferees hold such warrants, subject to certain transfer restrictions and the holders thereof are entitled to certain registration rights, and: (1) will not be redeemable by the Company (except as described in the Company’s IPO prospectus filed with SEC on October 13, 2021); and (2) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
The proceeds from the IPO in the amount of $146,625,000 was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee for the benefit of our public shareholders. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold in the IPO properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of the IPO or such later date as approved by our shareholders, or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of the IPO or such later date as approved by our shareholders, subject to applicable law.
 
On November 29, 2021, we announced that holders of the public Units may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and Warrants. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “ROSEU,” and the Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants that are separated will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbols “ROSE” and “ROSEW,” respectively.
 


 
Our IPO prospectus and amended and restated articles of association provided that we had until January 18, 2023 (the date which was 15 months after the consummation of the IPO) to complete an initial business combination. As stated in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 13, 2023, an extraordinary general meeting was held on January 12, 2023 (“Extension Meeting”) where our shareholders approved a proposal to amend our amended and restated articles of association (together with our amended and restated memorandum “Articles”) to extend the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination from January 18, 2023, to July 18, 2023 (the “Extension Period”). In connection with the Extension Meeting, holders of the Class A ordinary shares were permitted to exercise their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account. Shareholders holding 14,118,106 Class A ordinary shares elected to have their shares redeemed leaving an aggregate of approximately $2.8 million in the Trust Account following the Extension Meeting.
 
Business Combination with Prize
 
Business Combination Agreement
 
On October 20, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Inversiones e Inmobilaria GHC Ltda, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Chile (“Prize”) and, for certain limited purposes, Alejandro García Huidobro Empresario Individual (“AGH”) (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (as defined below), (i) Prize will cause to be incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, (a) an exempted company with limited liability to serve as “PubCo” for all purposes under the Business Combination Agreement and (b) an exempted company with limited liability to serve as “Merger Sub” for all purposes under the Business Combination Agreement, (ii) Prize and AGH will cause to be incorporated under the laws of Chile, a simplified stock corporation that will serve as “HoldCo” for all purposes under the Business Combination Agreement, in each case, as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Prize and (iii) promptly following the incorporation of PubCo, Merger Sub and HoldCo, Prize and AGH will consummate a pre-closing restructuring pursuant to which, among other things, all subsidiaries of Prize will become direct or indirect subsidiaries of HoldCo, HoldCo will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub, and Merger Sub will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Prize (collectively, the “Pre-Closing Restructuring”).
 
Following the Pre-Closing Restructuring, at the closing of the Business Combination, (i) the Company will be merged with and into PubCo with PubCo continuing as the surviving entity (the “First Merger”) and (ii) subsequent to the First Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into PubCo with PubCo continuing as the surviving entity (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”) (such transactions and those otherwise contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, collectively, the “Business Combination”).
 
The terms of the Business Combination Agreement, which contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, closing conditions and other terms relating to the Business Combination, are summarized below. Capitalized terms used in this Annual Report but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Business Combination Agreement, which is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report.
 
Consideration
 
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, by virtue of the First Merger, (i) each Rose Hill ordinary share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable PubCo ordinary share, and (ii) all outstanding warrants to purchase ordinary shares of Rose Hill will be converted into warrants to purchase the same number of PubCo ordinary shares and all rights with respect to Rose Hill ordinary shares under such Rose Hill warrants will be converted into rights with respect to the applicable PubCo ordinary shares.
 
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, by virtue of the Second Merger, each Merger Sub ordinary share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger will be converted into a number of PubCo ordinary shares equal to the quotient of (i) the Equity Value, divided by (ii) the number of Merger Sub ordinary shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger, divided by (iii) $10.00. The “Equity Value” under the Business Combination Agreement is an amount equal to (i) $328,000,000, minus (ii) the lesser of (a) the aggregate amount of transaction expenses (the “Specified Transaction Expenses”) of Prize and the Company (other than those expenses incurred in respect of obtaining an equity line of credit or similar financing arrangement to be in place and available to PubCo as of the closing of the Business Combination (“Closing”)) and (b) $10,000,000.
 
In the event that the Specified Transaction Expenses exceed $10,000,000, then the number of PubCo ordinary shares otherwise issuable to Rose Hill Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) under the Business Combination Agreement will be decreased by a number of shares equal to the amount of such excess divided by $10.00.
 


 
Earn-Out Shares
 
If, at any time following the Closing, the daily volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of PubCo ordinary shares is greater than or equal to (a) $18.00, (b) $22.00, (c) $26.00, or (d) $30.00 in each case, over any thirty (30) days on which the PubCo ordinary shares are tradeable on NASDAQ (“Trading Days”) within any consecutive forty-five (45) Trading Day period then PubCo will issue 2,948,800 PubCo ordinary shares to Prize (“Earn-Out Shares”) after the occurrence of each such consecutive forty-five (45) Trading Day period. For the avoidance of doubt, Prize may be entitled to receive a maximum of 11,795,200 Earn-Out Shares in the aggregate in respect of the occurrence of all four Earn-Out events.
 
Registration Rights and Lock-up Agreement
 
In connection with the Closing of the Business Combination Agreement, PubCo, the Sponsor, Prize and certain other parties thereto will enter into a registration rights and lock-up agreement (the “Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement”), which, among other things, (i) effective as of the Closing, terminates and replaces the current registration rights agreement, dated as of October 13, 2021, by and among Rose Hill, the Sponsor and the other parties thereto, (ii) provides that PubCo will be obligated to file a registration statement to register the resale of certain PubCo ordinary shares held by Sponsor, Prize and certain other parties thereto, at the consummation of the business combination, (iii) provides certain parties thereto including Prize, certain demand and piggyback registration rights, and (iv) provides for certain restrictions on transfer relating to PubCo ordinary shares and warrants to purchase PubCo ordinary shares held by Sponsor, Prize and certain parties thereto.
Company Support Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Rose Hill, Prize and AGH have entered into a company support agreement (the “Company Support Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, AGH has agreed to (a) vote his Merger Sub ordinary shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination and (b) certain transfer restrictions with respect to his Merger Sub ordinary shares and shares of Prize.
Sponsor Support Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor entered into a sponsor support agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed, among other things, to (i) certain restrictions on transfer relating to its ordinary shares of Rose Hill prior to the Closing as set forth therein, (ii) not redeem any of its shares of Rose Hill in connection with the vote to approve the Business Combination or any proposal to extend the date by which Rose Hill must complete an initial business combination, (iii) vote in favor of the Mergers and the other transactions and against any alternative transaction, (iv) waive certain anti-dilution provisions contained in Rose Hill’s Articles in connection with the Mergers and (v) subject a certain number of its Class B ordinary shares of Rose Hill to vesting.
Standby Equity Purchase Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement and for purposes of obtaining equity financing on behalf of PubCo at Closing, Prize entered into a standby equity purchase agreement with a financial investor and affiliate of Yorkville Advisors (the “Investor”), pursuant to which, among other things, at the Closing, PubCo will have the right (but not the obligation) to sell to the Investor, and the Investor will purchase from PubCo, up to $150,000,000 of PubCo ordinary shares at a purchase price of 97% of the Market Price (as defined therein) of the PubCo ordinary shares, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.
 
For additional information regarding the Business Combination and the transactions contemplated thereby, see the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 25, 2022.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Annual Report does not assume the closing of the Business Combination.
 
Rose Hill’s Purpose and Competitive Advantage
 
We believe that the Latin American region holds a diverse base of numerous public-ready businesses seeking capital to fund their operations and achieve long-term growth. However, most companies in the region face hurdles in their pursuit of equity capital through traditional avenues. Late private funding for emerging companies in Latin America remains scarce and expensive, while the local public capital markets outside Brazil have historically been inefficient, illiquid, and limited in depth as compared to the U.S. capital markets. We plan to capitalize on this pent-up demand for growth equity and market access to provide an attractive capital solution for the region’s high-growth private companies. We strongly believe that the growth path for many of these emerging private companies can be accelerated through a Nasdaq listing, access to the broad U.S. institutional investor base, and the type of strategic partnership that our company offers.
 


 
In pursuit of this goal, our investment thesis is based on three core principles to complete a business combination in Latin America: (i) successful navigation of these markets requires a dedicated team of individuals with long track records of success investing and operating in the region; (ii) successfully capitalizing on the Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or “SPAC”, as a vehicle which requires transaction expertise with the SPAC product and ample experience in structuring business combinations; and (iii) long-term value creation post business combination requires deep understanding of both U.S. public market dynamics and Latin American operating requirements. Based on these principles, Rose Hill was founded and strategically structured to provide a comprehensive array of both regional and product know-how that collectively maximizes our probability of success.
 
Our management team is comprised of individuals that collectively possess: (i) over 30 years of experience leading publicly traded companies and conglomerates in Latin America; (ii) more than $130 billion of completed mergers and acquisitions transactions across Latin American markets, including leading and managing the Investment Banking practice at Scotiabank in Mexico, and Latin American coverage at Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital; (iii) deep investment expertise from a partner at a $1.5 billion asset manager in the region; and (iv) experience underwriting and advising SPAC offerings and business combinations.
 
Our independent board of directors was selected to provide expertise across our five main Latin American target markets: Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. These individuals bring over 100 years of combined investing and advising experience across dozens of industries in the region. Our independent directors are industry leaders with substantial operational expertise, partners and presidents at leading private equity firms in Latin America, former country CEOs at consulting firms in the region, and former public company senior executives.
 
Our strategic investor in Latin America, Ameris Capital, brings (i) a deep understanding and track record of success investing in the region across multiple asset classes and industries; (ii) relationships with premier long-only investors in Latin America; (iii) an extensive background in creatively structuring deals in the region; and (iv) a wide breadth of public markets expertise.
 
We have thoughtfully integrated these principles across all layers of our structure. In our view, these structural advantages position Rose Hill as a well-rounded SPAC team with a deep understanding of every step of the business combination process, from deal sourcing and negotiating in Latin American markets, to forging a long-term successful partnership with a target company, like Prize, that will be well received by the U.S. public markets.

Our Strategic Investor
 
Ameris Capital, our strategic investor with deep expertise and experience in Latin America, is a Chilean-based alternative asset manager focused on private and public equities, real estate, private debt, and infrastructure investments with $1.5 billion in assets under management and over 50 investment professionals. Recognized as one of the leading alternative asset managers in the Andean region, Ameris Capital brings over 100 years of combined advisory, investment, and operational experience through their partners, assisting companies in their entire journey to develop, grow, and build long-lasting capabilities.

Their partners have been advisors to boards or board directors in companies across industries such as fintech, energy, consumer, industrials, finance, B2B technologies, mining services, and agribusiness.
 
Our relationship with Ameris will be reinforced by the service of Christian Moreno, President of Ameris, on our board of directors and of Jose Mujica, a partner and Head of private equity at Ameris, on our management team as Chief Strategy Officer. An affiliate of Ameris has made an investment in and is a member of our sponsor.
 
We will seek to leverage our strategic investor’s platforms, including the option to access its teams, deal prospects, and network to aid the management team in the identification, diligence and operational support of a target for our initial business combination. We believe that we will benefit from our strategic investor’s deep experience as a leading investment firm in Latin America, bringing extensive networks of relationships that we believe may provide us with a distinct advantage for sourcing opportunities and unlocking long-term shareholder value.
 
Latin America Market Opportunity
 
We believe that strong fundamentals across Latin America’s demographics support the convergence towards economic development, capital formation, and growth observed in developed countries such as the U.S. and Canada. The region’s expanding middle class, growing young population, participation of women in the labor force, and increasing urbanization position the Latin American economies on a higher growth trajectory than developed countries for the next decade. According to the World Bank, Latin America’s middle class grew by 48% from approximately 152 million people in 2009 to 225.3 million in 2020, signaling an increasing demand for new innovative products and services. In addition, Latin America’s population is more than double that of the U.S. at over 658 million, almost half of which are under 30 years old. Moreover, urbanization rates above 80% remain among the highest in the world, migrating the region’s economies towards higher needs for education, increased productivity, and stronger demand for financial, digitalization and telecommunication services.
 
We believe these favorable demographic trends combined with recent technological adoption, enable high growth industries such as fintech, e-commerce, telecommunications, clean technology, and healthcare to thrive and expand across the region. As a result, Latin America’s private sector is expected to capitalize on these growth trends driven by:
 

• | Infrastructure investments: Ongoing private and public investments in physical and digital infrastructure, such as (i) logistics and transport network infrastructure (ii) sustainable and clean energy generation capacity (iii) healthcare infrastructure, and (iv) digital connectivity including fiber, wireless towers and data centers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Largely underpenetrated services and product markets: Low penetration of financial services, insurance, and e-commerce services as a result of market inefficiencies, regulation, and economic underdevelopment. Wide and inexpensive mobile access is now available across the region (66% of Latin Americans own a smartphone) and increasing broadband penetration in major cities provide an opportunity for digitalization adoption in products and services across these markets; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong private equity and venture capital activity: Private equity funding in Latin America increased at a 20.2% CAGR from 2011 to 2019 to $14.3 billion, while venture capital investment soared from $143.0 million in 2011 to $4.6 billion in 2019. We believe that these robust trends, along with the ongoing institutionalization for many family-owned and private companies, are leading indicators of the upcoming requirements of growth capital in the region; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technological and digital expansion: The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the rapid technological assimilation, digitalization, and cloud migration in Latin America, allowing companies to process and manage large quantities of information through big data and cloud adoption. In addition, enhanced automation in manufacturing continues to drive productivity across Latin America; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable macroeconomic tailwinds: (i) inflation rates in the region remaining stable at 2.87% from 2011 to 2019, excluding Argentina and Venezuela (ii) average unemployment rates remaining stable at approximately 7.0% from 2011 to 2019, (iii) low interest rates across Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru, reducing companies’ cost of borrowing and shifting the region’s investment appetite into equities, and (iv) sustained increase in foreign direct investments (FDI) as a percentage of GDP, from 2.75% in 2009 to 3.16% in 2019, accelerating the inflow of capital and investment; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable geopolitical environment: Existing trade tensions between the United States and China have resulted in new tariffs decreasing the low-cost competitive advantage of China. As a result, multinationals are relocating supply chains out of Asia (accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic) into Latin America driven by favorable trade agreements, proximity, and cheap labor costs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Attractiveness of a U.S. Listing for Latin American Companies
 
In our view, the efficient and optimal path to maximize equity capital raising, liquidity, transparency and access to a diverse investor base is through a U.S. public listing instead of pursuing a late private funding or listing on a local exchange. Additionally, inefficiencies and friction across local capital markets, limited depth, and concentrated institutional investment are challenges for domestic IPOs. We believe a U.S. listing provides strong advantages compared to a local listing based on the following considerations:
 

• | Broader investor base: U.S. listed Latin American companies have access to a broader and sophisticated pool of investors, including emerging markets funds, Latin American long-only funds, qualified institutional buyers, Latin American pension funds, U.S. funds looking for emerging markets diversification, and retail investors. In contrast, Latin American local listing investors outside Brazil tend to be limited to local pension funds and select institutional investors, while retail participation remains low; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Higher liquidity levels: Access to a broader investor base in the U.S. allows for higher average daily trading volume (ADTV) levels. For 2020, the total value traded in the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges as a percentage of their market capitalization was 115%, compared to only 41% on average for the exchanges in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Peru; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Larger market size and higher risk appetite: The U.S. investor base has a vast breadth of experience analyzing and investing on emerging growth stories, as well as funding complex business models. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited depth of local markets: The region’s domestic equity markets have limited depth, with an average combined stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP of 51% in 2019 for the exchanges in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Peru; compared to 175% for the U.S. markets; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower Market and Ownership Concentration: Latin America’s local markets are dominated by a few large company groups as a percentage of total capitalization, while their ownership is largely concentrated in local pension funds. The U.S. markets provide lower levels of ownership and market concentration, which in turn fosters liquidity levels. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sector Opportunity
 
Although we will seek investments in all sectors and industries, we intend to focus on companies with distinct competitive advantages, leading market positions, and operations in fast-growing and profitable sectors in Latin America. Our management team, board of directors, and strategic investors have ample experience and successful track records operating, investing, and advising Latin American companies across the following sectors, and we expect to focus our primary search efforts on these:

• | Healthcare: We intend to focus our search efforts on companies within the healthcare services, diagnostics, medical equipment, generic pharmaceutical laboratories, digital and telehealth subsectors. In our view, limited government healthcare spending and insufficient coverage represents an opportunity for private companies to grow and capture significant market share. In 2018, healthcare spending per capita in the region reached $666.9, compared to $4,899.6 for OECD countries, with out-of-pocket expenditures as a percentage of total health expenditures reaching 30.1%, compared to 13.7% for OECD countries. In addition, improvements in basic infrastructure have shifted the region’s disease burden from communicable diseases to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer; greatly increasing the demand potential for mobile health tracking, telemedicine, diagnostics, and cost-effective therapies. In 2020, subsector market sizes in Latin America for diagnostics and mobile health reached $2.72 billion and $3.53 billion respectively. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial Services: We intend to target companies within the payments, transaction processing, asset management, insurtech, alternative lending, and digital banking subsectors. We believe a substantial opportunity exists in the financial services sector, specifically in digital banking and payments, given the region’s vastly underpenetrated banking systems coupled with an increase in both digitalization and broadband connectivity. As of May 1, 2021, approximately 50% of Latin Americans were unbanked, while 75% had access to internet connectivity, the majority being through mobile phones. Additionally, government regulators in countries such as Mexico and Brazil continue to lower barriers to entry that have historically prevented fintech companies from obtaining bank charters and lending licenses, while simultaneously promoting digital payment options and services. As a result, several fintech companies have emerged into traditionally underserved and untapped markets, providing efficient digital banking and B2B services for new consumers and merchants. In 2020, fintech venture capital funding in Latin America totaled $2.1 billion, representing a growth of 690% over the past five years. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology and Digital Infrastructure: We intend to focus on companies within the cloudtech, software, data center, IT services, fiber and cell phone tower subsectors. We believe the young demographics, high penetration of smartphone usage, and large-scale digitalization of companies in Latin America have resulted in numerous technology companies emerging and rapidly building digital infrastructure. Additionally, Latin American businesses are increasingly outsourcing their IT functions to more cost-efficient solutions through cloud service, cybersecurity, and IT providers. The region’s cloud computing market is projected to increase at a CAGR of 22.4% from 2019 to 2023, primarily driven by the increase in demand for the hybrid cloud, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS segments. We will seek to capitalize on the region’s heavy wave of technology investments experienced from 2009 to 2020, which saw $16 billion invested across 2,800 tech startups and $4.2 billion of which was raised in 2020 alone. This funding has resulted in numerous high-growth, disruptive companies, now at a mature stage and well poised for a listing on public markets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer Goods and E-commerce: We intend to focus on companies that access consumers through non-traditional digital channels and are data driven in their commercial approach. As demographics and income segmentation become more transparent in the region due to higher digital penetration and urbanization rates, including lower costs of acquiring data and accessing customer directly, we believe that e-commerce and e-services will continue gaining market share over traditional distribution and retail channels. As a percentage of total advertising expenditures, digital advertising in the region grew from 18% in 2015 to 39.1% in 2020, compared to 62.9% for the U.S. in 2020. Retail e-commerce in Latin America grew at a 16.5% CAGR since 2015 to $95.8 billion in 2020. In addition, COVID-19 exacerbated the growth in the e-commerce sector, with over 500 million consumers driven into lock-down regimes and 17% of such consumers attempting to execute an online purchase for the first time. Despite its recent expansion, the sector remains largely underpenetrated compared to developed economies, with e-commerce sales as a percentage of retail sales in the region of 5.6% in 2020, compared to 21.3% in the U.S.

• | Industrials and Manufacturing: We intend to target industrials and manufacturing companies that produce value added and non-commoditized products, have unique competitive advantages, and cater to large domestic and export markets with emphasis on end-products in industries of high structural growth or requiring significant tacit knowledge, such as aerospace & defense or electric vehicles. In our view, the lower labor costs, sizeable domestic and export markets, integrated production ecosystems, and relative ease of access to inputs offers substantial opportunity for profitable manufacturing in the region. In addition, free trade agreements between the United States and 11 countries in Latin America and geographic proximity to the United States gives preferable access to the largest consumer end-market in the world. From an enterprise standpoint, COVID-19’s disruption of just-in-time manufacturing that traditionally relied on Asian markets has caused western multinationals to look to diversify their supply-chains globally. We believe Latin America is well poised to attract this diversification given its proximity, cost advantage and similar time zone to the U.S.

Investment Criteria
 
We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, including Prize. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines.

• | Size: We intend to target companies whose pre-money valuation is between $400 million and $1 billion, determined by the sole discretion of our management team and according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies. We believe investing in companies of this size range offers, on average, higher growth potential and higher probability of stronger post business combination share price performance than larger capitalization stocks, as well as potential for favorable opportunities to invest in companies not accessible to large institutional investors. According to S&P data from 1990 to 2019, relative returns of small-cap indices such as S&P 600 and Russell 2000 have outperformed large-cap indices such as the S&P 500 Index. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth: We intend to focus on companies with consistent and historical revenue and EBITDA growth. In addition, we will seek companies that are well-positioned to capture additional market share; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Profitability: We intend to target established companies with demonstrated track records of profitability and operating cash flow through strong business fundamentals; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive Market Positioning: We expect to focus on companies that have achieved a strategic or sizable market position in a large addressable and growing industry, and in which a partnership with Rose Hill would provide a tangible opportunity to become a market leader through geographical expansion and/or higher market penetration within existing markets; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Public-listing Readiness: We intend to seek companies that have the appropriate corporate governance, financial controls, and reporting processes in place to fulfill the regulatory requirements of a U.S. publicly traded entity; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High-Quality Management Team: We expect to focus on companies with seasoned management teams with demonstrated track records and prepared to run a publicly traded company. We will devote significant time and effort into analyzing and reaching consensus with the target’s management and stakeholders to ensure their long-term strategy is aligned with our values and investment thesis; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG): We intend to focus on companies which have a strong sense of commitment towards solving key issues in their communities and making a significant impact to society and all key stakeholders. We will seek companies with a commitment to social, economic, and environmental stewardship and sustainability, a desire to increase diversity, equality, and inclusion with their business, product, service offering, or the desire to serve a specific social purpose. We believe a strong commitment to purpose or identity, coupled with a sound underlying business, often results in the delivery of long-term stakeholder value. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
So long as our securities are then listed on the Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 


 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on the Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In addition, in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our Articles provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person in their capacity as a director or officer of our company and the opportunity is one we are permitted to complete on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, business combination opportunities presented to our officers or directors in the context of their positions with any other entity to which they have fiduciary or contractual obligations will in any event be deemed presented to him or her in his or her capacity as a representative of such other entity.
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 


 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to a target business. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional IPO through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical IPO. The typical IPO process can take a longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the IPO process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an IPO is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
  
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.


Smaller Reporting Company
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30 and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares or shares of a new holding company in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to subscription agreements, forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our Trust Account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon the completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. Other than the potential availability of the backstop arrangement with our sponsor, we are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read our IPO prospectus or this Annual Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates be paid by us any finder’s fee or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
 
We have agreed to pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. In addition, we may make payments of up to $13,000 per month to members of our management team for services rendered to us commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq  through the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In addition, in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 


 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. See “Management—Conflicts of Interest.”
 
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review that may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 


 
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, subject to the provisions of our Articles. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
 
Under the Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

• | We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by the Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 

• | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 


 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon the Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our Articles (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Extension Period and (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our Articles provide that in no event, in connection with the approval of our initial business combination, will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our Articles would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with the Nasdaq rules.
 
If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our Articles:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon the completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company. In such case, our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and Class A ordinary shares held by the founders in favor of our initial business combination. As of January 31, 2023, our sponsor owns, on an as-converted basis, 95% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Therefore, we would not need any of the 256,984 public shares issued and outstanding (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted or assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted) to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have such initial business combination approved. Our directors and officers have entered into an agreement, imposing the obligation on them to vote in favor of our initial business combination, including the Business Combination Agreement with respect to our initial purchaser’s founder shares and Class A ordinary shares acquired by them. We expect that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 5% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares at the time of any such shareholder vote. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary shareholder approval will be received than would be the case if such persons agreed to vote their founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public shareholders.
 
Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. Our sponsor and each member of our management team have also entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our Articles (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Extension Period (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our Articles:
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 


 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon the completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, then, pursuant to our Articles, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Public Shares without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
 
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 
Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit / Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.



 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until the Extension Period (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders).
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
 
Our Articles provide that we will have until the end of the Extension Period (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders) to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within the Extension Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within the Extension Period. Our Articles provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.
 
Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within the Extension Period (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders), although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe.
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Articles (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Extension Period (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. However, in connection with the approval of our initial business combination, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 


 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining held outside the Trust Account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the Trust Account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.89. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.89. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.89 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.89 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters or our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.89 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.89 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.89 per public share.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of January 31, 2023, we have access to up to approximately $89,858 from funds held outside the Trust Account to pay any such potential claims.
 


 
In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our Trust Account received by any such shareholder.
 
If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.89 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Extension Period (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders), (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our Articles (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Extension Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the Trust Account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the Extension Period, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our Articles, like all provisions of our Articles, may be amended with a shareholder vote.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 981 Davis Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30327. Our office space is currently included in the $10,000 per month fee we pay to our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have five executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based the stage of the business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our Units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on our assessment, we identified a material weakness in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting because we did not maintain adequate controls over the classification and presentation of the statement of cash flows, specifically the classification of the purchase of marketable securities as operating activities instead of investing activities. Based on this evaluation, our management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. For additional information please see Item 9A.—Controls and Procedures.
 
 Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls.
 
The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
