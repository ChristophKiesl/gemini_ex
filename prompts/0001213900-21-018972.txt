ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Creatd, Inc. (“CRTD,” “the Company,” or “Creatd”) is a creator-first technology company and the parent company of the Vocal platform. Our mission is to empower creators, entrepreneurs, and brands through technology and partnership. We accomplish this through Creatd’s three main business pillars: Vocal Ventures, Creatd Partners, and our newest initiative, Recreatd. At its core, Creatd centers around the philosophy that creators are the driving force that propels success in the digital realm. This philosophy is represented by a framework we call the Creatd Cycle, which operates on the premise that creators produce content that attracts audiences, who in turn attract brands who are interested in reaching those audiences and the ability to generate new installations around bespoke ecosystems such as health and wellness, sports, and education.
 
Creatd’s first pillar, Vocal Ventures, houses our proprietary technology platforms, including Creatd’s flagship product, the Vocal platform, and its 36 wholly owned-and-operated creator communities. Through Vocal, creators can create and share their stories in a way that helps them get discovered by their ideal audiences and be rewarded for their creativity. Similarly, brands can access their ideal consumers and drive conversions for their products and services. The Vocal platform’s scalable and unique underlying agile framework lends itself well to future acquisitions and white-label opportunities for Creatd’s technology because of the ease with which other platforms can be integrated into our ecosystem.
  Creatd Partners, Creatd’s second pillar, houses our brand-oriented initiatives, including our agency businesses, Vocal for Brands and Seller’s Choice, as well as its corporate ventures and investments. Both of these agencies serve a multitude of clients, while the venture arm looks to make direct investments in the ones that have significant upside opportunity. Creatd Partners pairs Creatd’s resources and Vocal’s proprietary technology, which were built to simultaneously amplify creators’ discoverability and potential reward and help direct-to-consumer brands achieve conversions and reach their target audiences, while generating value for all of Creatd’s stakeholders.  
 
Recreatd is the pillar which houses Creatd’s intellectual property and legacy media assets, including acquired artwork, photographs and media memorabilia. Recreatd represents an initiative by Creatd to revitalize transmedia content, utilizing Vocal Ventures’ technology, data, and marketing capabilities to reboot archival media assets and e-commerce properties. Creatd has a history of successfully executing such acquisition and assimilation projects, including its resuscitation of General Media properties such as the iconic women’s magazine, Viva, into digital communities and absorbing once-defunct content communities like Creators Media (which at one time was valued at $50MM). Creatd has a vast collection of intellectual property and legacy content, including a documentary about the life of Bob Guccione directed by Barry Avrich; Till Human Voices Wake Us, a short film starring Lindsay Lohan and directed by famed photographer Indrani; No One’s Pet, the biography of Penthouse Pet Sheila Kennedy authored by renown film critic Glenn Kenny; and The Mind’s Eye, The Art of Omni. The Company’s ability to leverage its technology to revitalize this content represents a significant value proposition for media companies and publishers that are sitting on vast collections of content that are of supreme quality but are not in a suitable format for today’s consumer.

Vocal
 
Vocal, Creatd’s flagship product, is a robust, proprietary technology platform that provides best-in-class tools, safe and curated communities, and monetization opportunities that enable creators to find a receptive audience and get rewarded. Through Vocal, content creators can get discovered and monetize their content by connecting to their ideal audiences and partnering with the brands that want to reach those audiences.
 
Since its initial launch in 2016, Vocal has grown to be one of the fastest growing communities for content creators of all kinds, including writers, musicians, podcasters, photographers, and more; as of March 2021, Vocal has reached over 900,000 freemium creators and over 20,000 Vocal+ paid subscribers across its 36 owned and operated niche communities. 
 
Vocal provides a large stage for creators to connect with fans and find new audiences. In addition to enabling access to millions of unique monthly visitors, the platform provides creators with a full suite of tools and services for content creation, discovery, distribution, and monetization, including:
 

● | Easy-to use, rich media content editor: Vocal’s storytelling tools enable creators to produce beautiful and engaging stories in a simple, user-friendly interface, and incorporate rich-media content of all kinds, including streaming content, photos, videos, podcasts, product links, written text, and more. Vocal’s open canvas content creation editor makes it easy to create high-quality and engaging stories, and is a cost effective alternative to managing a blog content management system (CMS). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Numerous Monetization Features: Both of Vocal’s membership tiers–Vocal freemium and the Vocal+ premium tier – provide multiple monetization opportunities for creators. Creators can earn money i) every time their story is read, ii) by competing in Challenges, iii) by receiving ‘tips’ and ‘bonuses’ iv) by collaborating on branded content campaigns through the company’s in-house agency, Vocal for Brands. For freemium members, content ‘reads’ are monetized at a rate of $3.80 per 1,000 reads (calculated based on time on page, scrolling behavior, and other internal metrics), whereas Vocal+ members monetize at $6.00 per 1,000 reads. These rates are subject to change based on market trends or the introduction of additional features and plan tiers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Brand-safe advertising platform: Vocal was designed to target consumers in an authentic, non-interruptive way. Brand partnerships and collaborations allow companies tap into the power of Vocal through campaign-optimized stories, authored by real Vocal creators, that build brand affinity, trust, and drive sales. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transparent Performance Data: Creators can view their “Stats” at any time to view their individual performance data, such as how many Reads a given story received, how much money they have earned, and how many Tips, Bonuses, or ‘Likes,’ they received. Additionally, Vocal users have the ability to view key metrics such as community-specific data and Vocal+ membership data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Valuable Audience: The nature of Vocal’s genre-specific (niche) community structure is such that it generates a positively selected audience, a quality which makes Vocal an attractive prospect for creators and brands alike. In a niche community, audiences are inherently more likely to be interested in the particular content housed in that community.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Vocal+ is Creatd’s premium subscription membership program. Vocal+ members pay a membership fee for premium features, including receiving increased earnings for their content, reduced platform processing fees for Tips received, a Vocal+ badge on their creator page, eligibility to participate in exclusive Vocal+ Challenges, and more. Vocal+ offers a strong value proposition for new creators, as well as the over 900,000 freemium users registered to Vocal. Creators may sign up for a Vocal+ membership when they create an account, or they can upgrade an existing Vocal Free account to a Vocal+ account at any time. The current cost of a Vocal+ membership is either $9.99 per month or $99 annually. From time to time, the Company offers Vocal+ subscriptions at a discount for a predetermined number of months as a promotion for new subscribers.
 
Vocal for Brands
 
Digital audiences have become increasingly wary of traditional display and programmatic advertising tactics. Intrusive ads like pop-ups have proven to disrupt the consumer experience, leading to trends such as the fact that over 25% of internet users have ad blockers installed. Brands are actively seeking trustworthy and safe platforms like Vocal to drive engagement through non-interruptive brand storytelling and deliver invaluable performance metrics that help optimize their marketing efforts.

Creatd’s internal content studio, Vocal for Brands, pairs leading brands with authentic creators to produce marketing campaigns that are non-interruptive, engaging, and direct-response driven. The key value propositions for brands include:
 

● | Authentic Storytelling: Our internal data group partners brands with real Vocal creators to tell their brand’s story in a way that is both engaging and trustworthy. In addition, brands can opt to sponsor a Challenge, which effectively yield a collection of crowdsourced branded content for brands and help them reach a wider audience. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Valuable Audience: Vocal’s first-party data provides an opportunity to create highly targeted and segmented audiences to promote branded content. Most importantly, Vocal’s technology helps brands target the right audience by utilizing and applying that first-party data.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transparent Analytics: For every campaign we produce, our brand clients have access to story performance data, engagement data, behavioral data, and interest data. Brands can apply this data to further increase awareness and optimize audience targeting.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Vocal’s first-party data enables our team to create highly targeted and segmented audiences for Vocal for Brands campaigns, and help the brand reach their ideal audience. Brands can access story performance data, engagement data, behavioral data, and sentiment data, all of which is used to further optimize the campaign’s success. The combination of Vocal’s hyper-engaged audiences, user-generated communities, and brand-safe environment help brands achieve maximum ROAS (return on ad spend).
 
Vocal for Brands typically collects fixed fees ranging from $10,000 to $110,000, depending on campaign duration and specific client objectives. To date, Vocal for Brands’ client roster includes up-and-coming direct to consumer (DTC) brands such as IAC’s Vimeo, Moleskine, New York Post’s Decider, Lull, Daily Harvest, Cleancult, and more.
 
With the introduction of Challenges in early first quarter 2020, brands can now tap into Vocal’s network content creators and encourage them to interact with, learn about and promote their brand while benefiting from Vocal’s brand-safe, moderated, and curated environment. Vocal Challenges have a unique ability to capture the hearts and minds of the creative community and drive meaningful engagement. Challenges combine thought-provoking story prompts and sizable reward potential, which work to inspire creators and drive them toward participation. Brands can similarly capitalize on this combined effect by collaborating with Vocal on a sponsored Challenge, prompting the creation of high-quality stories that are centered around the brand’s mission and further disseminated through creators’ respective social channels and promotional outlets.
 
Seller’s Choice
 
In addition to Vocal for Brands, Creatd supports brands by providing managed and performance marketing services through Seller’s Choice. an in-house marketing agency for DTC (direct-to-consumer) and e-commerce clients. Acquired by Creatd in September 2019, Seller’s Choice provides direct-to-consumer brands with design, development, strategy, and sales optimization services. Its status as an Amazon Solution Provider and its weighty operational structure made it an ideal candidate for acquisition in late 2019. Creatd’s business model is built to absorb distressed operational infrastructures, integrate the few best components, and shed the non-essential costs.
Creatd Partners
  Creatd Partners is the Company’s corporate venture arm, as well as the business division that encompasses management of Seller’s Choice and Vocal for Brands. Creatd Partners invests in qualified brands who are aligned with our corporate mission, such as direct-to-consumer brands, digital platforms, and technologies that support entrepreneurs and the creator economy. Creatd Partners was established with the aim of nurturing high-potential, early-stage companies that can meaningfully benefit by leveraging Creatd’s technology, resources and proven capacity to optimize visibility, reach, and conversions for direct-to-consumer products and services. Creatd Partners investments are subject to the completion of rigorous due diligence and independent valuation assessment and may encompass a combination of financial and operational support in exchange for an equity stake in the business. 
 
Creatd Partners’ first investment is Plant Camp, a direct-to-consumer food company that creates healthy and nutritional upgrades to classic foods and was launched in December 2020. The Company has made three further investments, the most notable of which is an equity investment in the health and wellness DTC beverage space. Additionally, Creatd Partners is currently exploring future opportunities that fit its criteria and risk profile, seeking partner companies that combine a quality product, seasoned founders, and the ability to leverage Creatd’s platform technology.

Moderation and Compliance
 
One of the key differentiating factors between Vocal and most other user-generated content platforms is the fact that each story submitted to Vocal is run through the Company’s proprietary moderation process before it goes live on the platform. The decision to implement moderation into the submission process was in direct response to the rise of misinformation and bad actors on many social platforms. In response to these inherent pitfalls within the content landscape, Vocal’s proprietary moderation system combines the algorithmic detection of copyrighted material, hate speech, graphic violence, and nudity, and human-led curation to ensure the quality and safety of each story published on Vocal, thus fostering a safe and trustworthy environment for creators, audiences, and brands. Moderation and compliance are more important than ever in a world where ambiguity can systematically damage value. Vocal’s enforcement of community guidelines and emphasis on content moderation protects the platform, its creators, and Creatd shareholders.
 
Trust and safety are paramount to the Vocal ecosystem. We follow best practices when handling personally identifiable information, with guidance from the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
 
Platform Compliance Policies include:
 

● | Human-led, technology assisted moderation of every story submitted; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Algorithmic detection of hate speech, nudity, and copyright infringement; 
● | Brand, creator, and audience safety enforced through community watch; and 
● | The rejection of what we consider toxic content, with the understanding that diverse opinions are encouraged.

Technology Development
 
Vocal’s proprietary technology is built on Keystone, the same underlying open-source framework used by industry-leaders such as Atlassian, a $43-billion Australian technology company. Some of the key differentiating elements of Vocal’s technology are speed, sustainability, and scalability. The Company continues to invest heavily in research and development to continuously improve and innovate its platform, with the goal of optimizing the user experience for creators. Vocal’s architecture allows it to do more with less cost and provides a model capable of turning a profit.

Additionally, the Vocal platform and its underlying technology allows us to maintain an advantageous capital-light infrastructure. By using cloud service providers, we are able to focus on platform and revenue growth rather than building and maintaining the costly internal infrastructures that have materially affected so many legacy media platforms. Vocal’s technology has been specifically designed and built to scale without a material corresponding increase in operational costs. While our users can embed rich media, such as video, audio, and product links, into their Vocal stories, the rich media content is hosted elsewhere (such as YouTube, Instagram, Vimeo, Shopify, Spotify, etc.). Thus, our platform can accommodate rich media content of all kinds without bearing the financial or operational costs associated with hosting the rich media itself. In addition to the benefits this framework affords to the Company, it is the additional benefit to our content creators, in that a creator can increase their monetization; for example, a creator can embed their YouTube video into a Vocal story and thus derive earnings from both platforms when their video is viewed.
 
Application of First-Party Data
 
Creatd’s business intelligence and marketing teams identify and target individual creators, communities, and brands, utilizing empirical data harnessed from the Vocal platform. The team’s ability to apply its proprietary first-party data works to reduce acquisition costs for new creators and to help provide brands with conversions and an ideal targeted audience. In this way, our ability to apply first-party data is one of the value-drivers for the Company and the key advantages of its closed ecosystem strategy, which we refer to as the Creatd Cycle.
 
In its simplest definition, first-party data is data that you collect directly from your customers. Even the most simplistic blog website is collecting some degree of first-party data; Creatd’s edge is in its application of that data. Our organization is constantly collecting a tremendous amount of first-party behavioral data extracted from the Vocal platform. To date, we have collected hundreds of millions of data points around our customers and our audiences.
 
Importantly, we do not sell that data, that being a common monetization opportunity for many other businesses. Instead, we use our collected first-party data for the purposes of bettering the platform. Specifically, our data helps us understand the behaviors and attributes that are common among the creators, brands, and audiences within our ecosystem. We then pair our first-party Vocal data with third-party data from distribution platforms such as Facebook and Snapchat to provide a more granular profile of our creators, brands, and audiences.
 
It is through generating this valuable first-party data that we can continually enrich and refine our targeting capabilities for branded content promotion and creator acquisition, and specifically, to reduce our creator acquisition costs (CAC) and subscriber acquisition costs (SAC). Lower acquisition costs combined with increasing lifetime value (LTV) per subscriber, means that our enterprise value is accelerating each time we acquire a new user. We anticipate the lifetime value of our subscribers to increase as we introduce more features that cater to the needs of our creators. It is Vocal’s unique capability to collect and apply first-party behavioral data that allows us to simultaneously increase the LTV of our subscribers over time, while lowering the cost to acquire them. In fact, the link between incentivizing creators and lowering creator acquisition costs is a primary focus of the data science team, and an important consideration for every feature we develop for the Vocal platform.
 
Competition
 
The idea for Vocal came as a response to what Creatd’s founders recognized as systemic flaws inherent to the digital media industry and its operational infrastructures. Depreciating value of digital media business models built on legacy technology platforms created a unique opportunity for development of a creator-centric platform that could appeal to a global community and, at the same time, be capable of acquiring undervalued complimentary technology assets.
 
Creatd’s founders built the Vocal platform upon the general thesis that a closed and safe ecosystem utilizing first-party data to increase efficiencies could create a sustainable and defensible business model. Vocal was strategically developed to provide value for content creators, readers, and brands, and to serve as a home for the ever-increasing amount of digital content being produced and the libraries of digital assets lying dormant.

Vocal is most commonly discussed as a combination of:
 

● | Medium, a platform for writers built by former Twitter founder Ev Williams; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reddit, a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patreon, a membership platform that provides business tools for content creators to run a subscription service. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Importantly, Creatd does not see Vocal as a substitute or competitor to segment-specific content platforms, such as Vimeo, YouTube, Instagram, or SoundCloud. We don’t want to replace anyone; we built Vocal to be accretive to the entire digital ecosystem. In fact, one of the most powerful components of our technology is the fact that Vocal makes it easy for creators to embed their existing published content, including videos, songs, podcasts, photographs, and more, directly into Vocal. We see this as a growth opportunity by building partnerships with the world’s greatest technology companies and to further spread our roots deeper into the digital landscape.
 
Revenue Model
 
Creatd’s revenues are primarily generated through:
 

● | Creator Subscriptions: Vocal+ subscription offering provides creators with increased monetization and access to premium tools and features. At approximately $10 per month, Vocal+ offers creators a strong value proposition for freemium users to upgrade, while providing a scalable source of monthly recurring gross revenue for Creatd. Management projects 100,000 paid subscribers in 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marketing Partnerships: Vocal partners with leading brands and creators through its internal content studio, Vocal for Brands, to produce influencer and content marketing campaigns, including sponsored Challenges, that leverage the power of Vocal. Branded stories and Challenges are optimized for conversions, distributed to a targeted audience based on Vocal’s first-party data, and are optimized for conversions to maximize revenue growth.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Managed Services: Creatd’s in-house marketing agency for e-commerce, Seller’s Choice, provides direct-to-consumer brands with design, development, strategy, and sales optimization services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform Processing Fees and Microtransactions: With Tipping and other types of microtransactions, audiences can engage and support their favorite Vocal creators by actively investing in their creativity. Vocal takes a platform processing fee on all transactions. Each Tip sent on Vocal generates revenue for the Company in the form of platform processing fees. For Vocal Free creators, we retain a 7% platform processing fee for every Tip exchanged. For Vocal+ creators, we retain a 2.9% platform processing fee. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Affiliate sales: Vocal generates revenue through affiliate marketing relationships, which pays the Company a percentage of purchases made on our platform. Affiliate relationships include Amazon, Skimlinks, Tune, and more. This represents a unique opportunity in the post-pandemic environment where brands need expansive distribution pipelines such as Vocal to reach broader audiences. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | E-commerce: Our e-commerce strategy involves revitalizing archival imagery and media content in dormant legacy portfolios. Our curation and data capabilities have helped us create scalable and definable value for our internal collection of media assets through financing, trademarking, licensing, and production opportunities. Creatd has an exclusive license to leverage the stories housed on Vocal, reimagining them for films, episodic shows, games, graphic novels, collectibles, books, and more. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy:
 
Continued growth is likely to be achieved by focusing on the following key areas:
 

● | Creator Growth: Vocal brings new creators, their audience, and brands to its platform through organic growth, performance marketing, and brand-building campaigns that drive awareness. As the Vocal team continues to collect first-party behavioral data, we are able to further refine an ideal user profile and hone a specific targeting strategy to effectively scale the platform’s creator base. Our product roadmap includes new features that will work to incentivize creators to help us expand the Vocal network organically; upcoming features include creator referrals and gated content, which will enable creators to utilize Vocal’s microtransaction capabilities to charge recurring fees for exclusive content. With these new features, creators will have further opportunities to get discovered and earn on Vocal, which works to the benefit of the entire platform. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Brand Partnerships: Continued investment in new product offerings for brand storytelling on Vocal with the goal of increasing the value to brands in the form of analytics, audience engagement, and conversion data for their products and services. The Vocal for Brands in-house content studio is constantly evolving in order to elevate brand relationships, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

● | Licensing and Transmedia Opportunities: In collaboration with other production and media companies, as well as with our expanding user base, we look for content that can be leveraged for adaptation to film, television, digital shorts, books, and comic series. We believe that Vocal’s ever-expanding community of creators and influencers affords us with the unique opportunity to cultivate these relationships. This initiative is referred to by the Company as Recreatd. 
● | White Label Opportunities: White-labeling Vocal’s underlying platform architecture can be utilized for application in a range of industries, including use by sports franchises, trade companies, education organizations, companies in the financial sector, and others. An example of a white label installation of Vocal currently on our drawing board is a platform called Give. The idea behind Give is to borrow Vocal’s topic-specific community structure and adapt it for the non-profit sector. The Give platform would function as a network of vetted, verified organizations for which creators can raise awareness, funding or discussions using Vocal’s existing features like storytelling tools, community engagement, and microtransactions. Give will provide charities with the tools and resources to capture attention and donations in what is a saturated non-profit space.
● | Vocal Global: Vocal Global is Creatd’s new market expansion strategy for applying Vocal’s technology to international platform opportunities. While the U.S., U.K., and Canada represent the vast majority of our audience, we believe there will be significant demand for our product in overseas markets–including Asia, the Middle East, and South America–particularly for foreign language installations of the product, an initiative which Creatd refers to as “Content Without Borders.” 

Acquisition Strategy
 
Creatd’s hybrid finance and design culture is key to its acquisition strategy. Acquisition targets are companies that meet a set of opportunistic or financial standards or that are part of specific digital environments that are accretive and can seamlessly integrate into Creatd’s existing revenue lines. Creatd will continue to make strategic acquisitions when presented with opportunities that are in the interest of shareholder value.
Corporate History and Information
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 30, 1999 under the name LILM, Inc. The Company changed its name on December 3, 2013 to Great Plains Holdings, Inc.
 
On February 5, 2016 (the “Merger Closing Date”), we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with GPH Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and Jerrick Ventures, Inc., a privately-held Nevada corporation headquartered in New Jersey (“Jerrick”), pursuant to which the Merger Sub was merged with and into Jerrick, with Jerrick surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”).

In addition, Mr. Campbell assumed all of our debts, obligations and liabilities, including any existing prior to the Merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Spin-Off Agreement.
 
Effective February 28, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Statutory Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which we became the parent company of Jerrick Ventures, LLC, our wholly-owned operating subsidiary (the “Statutory Merger”).

On July 25, 2019, we filed a certificate of amendment to our articles of incorporation, as amended (the “Amendment”), with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effectuate a one-for-twenty (1:20) reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our common stock without any change to its par value. The Amendment became effective on July 30, 2019. The number of shares of authorized common stock was proportionately reduced as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. The number of shares of authorized preferred stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split as all fractional shares were “rounded up” to the next whole share.
 
All share and per share amounts for the common stock indicated in this Form 10-K have been retroactively restated to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.
 
On September 11, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Seller’s Choice, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“Seller’s Choice”). Seller’s Choice is digital e-commerce agency based in New Jersey (see Note 4).

On September 9, 2020, the Company filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change our name to “Creatd, Inc.”, which became effective on September 10, 2020. 
 
Recent Developments 
 
Nasdaq Letter of Reprimand
 
On January 4, 2021, the Company received a letter from the staff of The Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Exchange”) notifying the Company that the Exchange had determined to delist the Company’s common stock and warrants from the Exchange based on the Company’s non-compliance with the Exchange’s (i) $5 million stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5505(b), (ii) the $2.5 million stockholders’ equity requirement or any of the alternatives for continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b), and (iii) the Company’s failure to provide material information to the Exchange pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(a)(1).


8

 

On February 11, 2021, the Company met with the Exchange’s Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) with respect to such determination, in accordance with the Exchange’s rules and, pursuant to such request by the Company to appeal, the delisting of the Company’s securities and the Form 25 Notification of Delisting filing was stayed pending the Panel’s decision.
 
On March 9, 2021, the Exchange notified the Company that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company on the Exchange. Notwithstanding the Panel’s determination to continue the listing of the Company’s securities on the Exchange, the Panel issued a public reprimand letter to the Company, pursuant to Listing Rule 5815(c)(1)(D), based on its finding “that the Company failed to meet the initial listing criteria with respect to stockholders’ equity and failed to provide Nasdaq with material information with respect to that deficiency.” Specifically, the Panel found that the Company failed to comply with Listing Rule 5250(a)(1), requiring it to notify Nasdaq of certain significant developments that led to the Company’s prior representations about its ability to satisfy the initial listing requirements being inaccurate. In reaching its determination to continue the listing of the Company on Nasdaq, the Panel acknowledged that the Company has since demonstrated compliance with the initial listing requirement for stockholders’ equity and all other applicable initial listing requirements. The Panel also determined that the violations were inadvertent and that the Company had relied on advice of counsel at the time in its interactions with the Nasdaq staff (“Staff”). The Panel also acknowledged the Company’s efforts to implement structural changes within the Company to avoid similar misstatements in the future and that would allow for proper accounting and disclosure on an ongoing basis.
 
A Panel Monitor has been implemented under Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A) for a period of one year from the date of the Letter.
