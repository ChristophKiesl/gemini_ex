COMPANY OVERVIEW
 

Corporate Overview
 
Life On Earth, Inc. is a cloud enterprise software developer/ provider that enables rapid innovation to keep enterprise operations safe, compliant and manageable. The Company’s products offered are designed to help organizations innovate and modernize legacy systems while minimizing cost and risk of business disruptions and ensure regulatory compliance. Through its recent acquisition of SmartAxiom, Inc., the Company now has the capabilities of offering software that manages and secures the Internet-of-Things (IoT) through patented, lite blockchain technology running among those devices at the edge of the Internet and enabling them to defend themselves. Our peer-to-peer distributed ledgers improve security, latency, reliability and manageability. We have uniquely created, through our SmartAxiom subsidiary, the endpoint-to-cloud blockchain solution, while our IoT Smart Contracts manage NFTs and push intelligence to the edge. The SmartAxiom technology is proving value in verticals such as smart buildings, manufacturing lines and shipment tracking. It interoperates with enterprise systems such as IBM Blockchain and Microsoft Azure and is proven on many ARM and Intel based microcontrollers such as those from Intel, NXP, Renesas, Marvell, and Broadcom.
 
The Company previously was a brand accelerator and incubator Company that was focused on building and scaling concepts in the natural consumer products category (“CPG”). During the year ended May 31, 2021, the Company discontinued the wholesale beverage distribution operations, and the Company announced its intention divest away from its business as a Consumer-Packaged Goods (“CPG”) Company. Accordingly, the Company’s results of operations for the year ended May 31, 2020, reflect a charge in the aggregate amount of $786,436,
 
On November 11, 2019, the Board of Directors and a majority of the voting power approved a resolution to effectuate a 5:1 Reverse Stock Split. and an increase in authorized Shares of Common Stock from One Hundred million (100,000,000) to Two Hundred million (200,000,000) shares of common stock, $0.001 par value. The Company received approval from FINRA on March 25, 2020 and, on that date, the reverse stock split became effective. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split. 
 
Company History
 
Life On Earth, Inc. was incorporated in April 2013.
 
In October 2013, we signed a distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage, Inc. (“Gran Nevada”), an entity related through common management and ownership. The agreement provides us with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada’s beverages in the United States with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada’s distributors. The agreement was for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five-year terms unless terminated. We initiated sales and distribution operations in March 2014. This agreement was renewed for an additional 5 years as per the agreement. During the years ended 2020 and 2019, the Company sold $0 and $73,592 respectively. These products were produced by a third party copacker and were not purchased from Gran Nevada. The decrease in sales from 2019 to 2020 was related to limited production capacity for the Gran Nevada Horchata that the company was producing. The availability of 3rd party copackers that can produce an Horchata are limited and it directly impacted the sales. As there is currently no co-packing available for this product the Company does not know if they will be able to produce this product again in the future.

In July 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Energy Sources Distributors, Inc. (“ESD”) from its three founding shareholders. ESD provides wholesale distribution of specialty beverage products from its headquarters in Gilroy, California. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $450,000 in cash. We retained one of the selling founders as General Manager for a term of twelve (12) months pursuant to an employment agreement to manage operations at the ESD facility in Gilroy, California. ESD is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The acquisition of ESD in July 2016 allowed the Company to expand distribution on the West Coast. In June 2019, the Company further decided to discontinue the wholesale beverage distribution operations in Northern California and, on November 4, 2019, ESD filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.
 
In October 2017, the Company acquired Victoria’s Kitchen, LLC (“VK”). VK is a specialty beverage company that makes exceptional European-inspired drinks. VK’s beverages are natural and all the beverages are Gluten-Free, GMO-Free, Dairy-Free, Vegan and contain no artificial ingredients or preservatives.
 
On April 30, 2018, the Company acquired The Giant Beverage Company Inc. (“Giant” or “GBC”). Giant is a Direct Store Delivery (DSD) business that covers the five boroughs of New York City under an eight-route distribution system. GBC serviced over 600 accounts in the five boroughs. Giant services mainly independent retailers but was expanding to service authorized chain accounts.
 
On May 7, 2019, Life On Earth, Inc., GBC, and Frank Iemmiti and Anthony Iemmiti (“Frank and Anthony Iemmiti”) entered into a Dispute Resolution and Resale agreement that will resolve all existing disputes between the two parties and will also result in the sale of the ownership of Giant back to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company deposited $50,000 into an Attorney’s Trust Account. Frank and Anthony Iemmiti have a continuing obligation to provide the Company with all financial information of Giant (the “Giant Financial Information”) that the Company needs to complete its SEC reporting requirements. On July 4, 2019 the Company and Frank and Anthony Iemmiti executed a Dispute Resolution and Resale agreement that at the closing the Company authorized the release of the $50,000 to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti. Also, at closing, the Company also paid Frank and Anthony Iemmiti the agreed upon consideration of $62,718 of the Company shares at $0.80 per share. Lastly at the closing, with an effective date of March 2, 2019 the Company sold GBC to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti for 291,000 shares of the Company stock that they owned. The sale of the Giant Beverage Company to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti became effective March 1, 2019.


On May 11, 2021, LFER acquired SmartAxiom with all their assets including intellectual properties, Patents and core Internet of Things (IoT) software that enables securing sensor devices and communication to the cloud-based software. The agreed purchase price was $6,250,000 paid as follows: (a) $1,950,000 by issuing 13,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, upon closing; (b) $2,100,000 by issuing 210,000 shares of the Company’s Series D convertible preferred shares (each share of the Company’s Series D convertible preferred is convertible into 10 shares of the Company’s common stock); and, (c) $2,200,000 to be paid pursuant to a full earnout based on SmartAxiom GAAP revenue recognition in the amount of $1,500,000 within the first eighteen months after closing date of the acquisition. The earnout will be prorated based on the SmartAxiom revenues received over an eighteen-month period. 
 
Sales and Distribution 
 
The Company markets and sells its logistics solutions based on proprietary patented technologies. The logistics solution consists of a multi-tenant cloud system managing BlockTracker cellular tracking devices, which sense location, temperature, vibration, pressure and light level. The device can also act as a gateway and connect to additional nearby sensors via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It has one temperature logger per box and reports to one BlockTracker per installed box. The management system, built with SmartAxiom’s Tenacious cloud backend, shows shipment location and condition, and notifies by short messaging service (SMS) when monitored parameters like temperature, humidity, light, vibration etc. exceed configured parameter, has geofencing and tools to activate devices and assemble shipments. The company has developed complete end-to-end solution for multiple industries with Supply Chain Management, Warehouse and Asset Management, and Industrial IoT solutions. These solutions are targeted to serve the fastest-growing IoT base edge computing, mobility (tracking and visualizing distributed assets) and manufacturing industry IoT solution markets. The Company also provides custom solution services to adopt and integrate its standard solution to customer environments and specification through its consulting, integration and support services group. The custom solutions focus is solving customers’ cyber security and vulnerabilities in their IoT business environment with patented IoT technologies.

Production and Distribution
 The Company strategy is to create end-to-end solution and partner with platform technologies providers and system integrators. Our focus is to develop solutions and provide customization, integration and support to our partners. We have a small team of highly technical and experienced personnel to support our various partners that include Renesas (our IoT platform partner), Amazon & Microsoft (our Cloud platform partners), IBM (Block Chain software partner) and several system integrators and technologies providers. Our primary software development is conducted in California, USA. We also have an offshore development and support center in India. In addition, we have expert resources in Dublin, Ireland.
Competition

Our SmartAxiom product line has multiple competitors for Internet of things (IoT) security technologies, which include Mocana, DeviceAuthority, Xage and Atonomy. However, these vendors do not address the distributed block chain technologies, nor do they have any rival patents in this space. In the logistics industry there are literally hundreds of competitors. Our competitors have greater operational histories, financial resources and personnel than we do. On the other hand, we have a comprehensive solution protected by our patented technologies such as the edge security software with distributed blockchain security for IoT devices.
 
The Company’s solution differentiators and advantage of our technologies-based solution is the robust end-to-end solution.
 
Government Regulation
 
 There are no government regulations that we need to adhere to support IoT solutions.
 
 Research and Development Activities
 
The Company is currently involved in developing a Center of Excellence to support large enterprise clients’ solutioning and integration needs. We are working with Partner and System Integrators to determine the level of subject matter experts (SMEs) and support infrastructure needed to ensure their support requirements.
Employees
 
The Company currently has three full-time employees, as follows: a CEO, COO, and President, and its wholly owned subsidiary, SmartAxiom, Inc., has 6 full-time employees and 8 subcontractors and services providers.
 
Certain positions, such as senior sales executives, solution architects and customer support for both the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, are being filled with paid independent contractors or insider owners who do not receive cash compensation but may receive stock compensation. In certain regions of the United States, we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies. The Company also outsources its logistics to third parties, which can reduce the need for employees in these roles.
 
Going Concern Qualification

Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses from inception of approximately $18,600,000, has limited revenues and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis. The Company has negative working capital of $9,676,000 as of May 31, 2021. The Company’s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including, but not limited to, continued progress in finding business opportunities. We have experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. This situation creates uncertainties about our ability to execute our business plan, finance operations, and indicates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We continue to experience negative cash flows from operations, as well as an ongoing requirement for additional capital to support working capital needs. Therefore, currently, based upon our near-term anticipated level of operations and expenditures, management believes that cash on hand, excluding cash available under our line of credit, is not sufficient to enable us to fund operations for 12 months from the date the financial statements included in this Report are issued.
 At May 31, 2021, we had cash on hand of $34,629 and an accumulated deficit of $18,635,356. See“Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
