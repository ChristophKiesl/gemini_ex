ITEM 1—BUSINESS
Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 2004. The principal executive office is located in Louisville, Kentucky.
General Development of Business
The Company is a growing restaurant company operating predominately in the casual dining segment. Our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, W. Kent Taylor, started the business in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Clarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to 634 restaurants in 49 states and ten foreign countries. Our mission statement is "Legendary Food, Legendary Service®." Our operating strategy is designed to position each of our restaurants as the local hometown favorite for a broad segment of consumers seeking high quality, affordable meals served with friendly, attentive service. As of December 29, 2020, we owned and operated 537 restaurants and franchised an additional 69 domestic restaurants and 28 international restaurants. 
Narrative Description of Business
Of the 537 restaurants we owned and operated at the end of 2020, we operated 503 as Texas Roadhouse restaurants, 31 as Bubba’s 33 restaurants and three as Jaggers restaurants. Throughout this report, we use the term "restaurants" to include Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33, unless otherwise noted.
Texas Roadhouse is a moderately priced, full-service, casual dining restaurant concept offering an assortment of specially seasoned and aged steaks hand-cut daily on the premises and cooked to order over open grills. In addition to steaks, we also offer our guests a selection of ribs, seafood, chicken, pork chops, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and an assortment of hamburgers, salads and sandwiches. The majority of our entrées include two made-from-scratch side items, and we offer all our guests a free unlimited supply of roasted in-shell peanuts and fresh baked yeast rolls.
Bubba’s 33 is a family-friendly, sports restaurant concept featuring scratch-made food, ice cold beer and signature drinks. Our menu features burgers, pizza and wings as well as a wide variety of appetizers, sandwiches and dinner entrées. Our first Bubba’s 33 restaurant opened in May 2013 in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
Jaggers is a fast-casual restaurant concept offering burgers, hand-breaded chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches served with scratch-made sauces. In addition, we offer fresh salads that are chopped and tossed when ordered and served with homemade dressings. Jaggers offers drive-thru, carry-out, and dine-in service options. Our first Jaggers restaurant opened in December 2014 in Noblesville, Indiana.
Financial Information about Operating Segments
We consider our restaurant and franchising operations as similar and have aggregated them into a single reportable segment. The majority of the restaurants operate in the U.S. within the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry, providing similar products to similar customers, and possessing similar pricing structures, resulting in similar long-term expected financial performance characteristics. Each of our 537 company restaurants is considered an operating segment. 
COVID-19 Impact
​
On March 13, 2020, the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic (the "pandemic") was declared a National Public Health Emergency. Shortly after the national emergency declaration, state and local officials began placing restrictions on restaurants, some of which allowed To-Go or curbside service only while others limited capacity in the dining room. By late March, all of our domestic company and franchise restaurants were under state or local order which only allowed for To-Go or curbside service. Beginning in early May 2020, state and local guidelines began to allow dining rooms to re-open, typically at a limited capacity. While all of our dining rooms were able to open in some capacity, many were required to close again in areas more severely impacted by the pandemic. As of December 29, 2020, 82% of our company restaurants had their dining rooms operating under various limited capacity restrictions. Our remaining restaurants were limited to outdoor and/or To-Go or curbside service only.
​

In response to the impact of the pandemic on our restaurant operations, we have developed a hybrid operating model that accommodates our limited capacity dining rooms together with enhanced To-Go, which includes a curbside and/or drive-up operating model, as permitted by local guidelines. This includes design changes to our building to better accommodate the increased To-Go sales and the expansion of outdoor seating areas where allowed. We also have installed booth partitions in all of our restaurants as an added safety measure for our guests. In addition, we have increased our already strict sanitation requirements, are conducting daily health and temperature checks for all employees before they begin their shift and are requiring personal protective equipment to be worn by all restaurant employees at all times. As we work through the local regulations at each of our locations, the safety of our employees and guests remains our top priority.
​
As a result of the dining room restrictions and temporary closures, we have experienced a significant decrease in traffic which has impacted our operating results. While the majority of our dining rooms have re-opened, a significant portion continue to operate under capacity restrictions that severely limit the number of guests we can serve. In addition, while we have seen significant sales growth in our To-Go program, even with dining rooms re-opened, we currently do not expect these sales will generate a similar profit margin and cash flows to our normal operating model. We expect our operating results to continue to be impacted until at least such time that all state and local restrictions are lifted, and our dining rooms can operate at full capacity. We cannot predict how long the pandemic will last, how long it will take until all state and local restrictions will be lifted, or the extent to which our dining rooms will have to close again. In addition, we cannot predict the overall impact on the economy or consumer spending habits. The impact on our operating results as well as the operational and financial measures we have implemented in response to the pandemic have been included throughout this report. 
​
In response to the pandemic, the Company and our Board of Directors implemented the following measures in 2020 to enhance financial flexibility:
​

● | Decreased the number of planned new restaurants for 2020;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Suspended all quarterly cash dividends occurring after March 27, 2020;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Suspended all share repurchase activity;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Expanded the capacity of the revolving credit facility and increased the borrowings by $240 million; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Decreased compensation including voluntary reductions of salary and bonus for the executive and leadership teams to make relief grants available for restaurant employees. Each non-employee member of the Board of Directors also volunteered to forgo their director and committee fees along with any cash retainers effective April 1, 2020 and continuing throughout fiscal 2020. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective March 27, 2020, legislation referred to as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") was passed to benefit companies that were significantly impacted by the pandemic. This legislation allowed for the deferral of the social security portion of the employer portion of FICA payroll taxes from the date of enactment through the end of 2020. Amounts are required to be repaid in equal installments at the end of 2021 and 2022. As of December 29, 2020, the Company had deferred $47.3 million in payroll taxes with the amount due in 2021 included in accrued wages and payroll taxes and the amount due in 2022 included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 
​
The CARES Act also allowed for an Employee Retention Credit for companies severely impacted by the pandemic to encourage the retention of full-time employees. This refundable payroll tax credit was available for any company that had fully or partially suspended operations due to government order or experienced a significant decline in gross receipts and had employees who were paid but did not actually work. The Company provided various forms of relief pay for hourly restaurant employees throughout the year, a significant portion of which qualified for this tax credit. For the year ended December 29, 2020, we recorded $7.0 million related to this credit which is included in labor expense in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
​
Finally, the CARES Act provided for small business loans that were forgivable if certain criteria were met. The Company did not pursue any of these loans on behalf of company restaurants as we believe we have sufficient alternatives for raising capital if needed.

Operating Strategy
Although a significant portion of 2020 required us to focus on adapting our business to account for the impacts of the pandemic, we remain committed to our core operating strategy that has defined and grown our brand. The operating strategy that underlies this growth is built on the following key components:

● | Offering high quality, freshly prepared food. We place a great deal of emphasis on providing our guests with high quality, freshly prepared food. As part of our process, we have developed proprietary recipes to provide consistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants. We expect a management level employee to inspect every entrée before it leaves the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest’s order and meets our standards for quality, appearance and presentation. In addition, we employ a team of product coaches whose function is to provide continual, hands-on training and education to our kitchen staff for the purpose of promoting consistent adherence to recipes, food preparation procedures, food safety standards, food appearance, freshness and portion size. At our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we hand-cut all but one of our assortment of steaks and make our sides from scratch. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Offering performance-based manager compensation. We offer a performance-based compensation program to our individual restaurant managers and multi-restaurant operators, who are called "managing partners" and "market partners," respectively. Each of these partners earns a base salary plus a performance bonus, which represents a percentage of each of their respective restaurant’s pre-tax income. As a result of the pandemic and the impact on restaurant operating results, we guaranteed a portion of these performance bonuses in the periods that were the most significantly impacted. By providing our partners with a significant stake in the success of our restaurants and underscoring our long-term commitment to them during the pandemic with guaranteed bonuses, we believe that we are able to attract and retain talented, experienced and highly motivated managing and market partners. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focusing on dinner. In a high percentage of our restaurants, we limit our operating hours to dinner only during the weekdays with approximately one half of our restaurants offering lunch on Friday. By focusing on dinner, our restaurant teams have to prepare for and manage only one shift per day during the week. We believe this allows our restaurant teams to offer higher quality, more consistent food and service to our guests. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Offering attractive price points. We offer our food and beverages at moderate price points that we believe are as low as or lower than those offered by many of our competitors in any given market. Within each menu category, we offer a choice of several price points with the goal of fulfilling each guest’s budget and value expectations. For example, at our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, our steak entrées, which include the choice of two side items, generally range from $10.99 for our 6-ounce Sirloin to $26.99 for our 23-ounce Porterhouse T-Bone. The per guest average check for the Texas Roadhouse restaurants we owned and operated in 2020 was $17.86. Per guest average check represents restaurant sales divided by the number of guests served. We consider each sale of an entrée to be a single guest served. Our per guest average check is higher as a result of our weekday dinner only focus. At our Bubba’s 33 restaurants, our entrées range from $9.99 for our Classic Cheeseburger to $19.99 for our 16-inch Meaty Meaty pizza. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creating a fun and comfortable atmosphere with a focus on high quality service. We believe the service quality and atmosphere we establish in our restaurants is a key component for fostering repeat business. We focus on keeping our table-to-server ratios low to allow our servers to truly focus on their guests and serve their needs in a personal, individualized manner. Our Texas Roadhouse restaurants feature a rustic southwestern lodge décor accentuated with hand-painted murals, neon signs, and southwestern prints, rugs and artifacts. Additionally, our restaurants continuously play upbeat country hits. Our Bubba’s 33 restaurants feature walls lined with televisions playing sporting events and music videos and are decorated with sports jerseys, neon signs and other local flair.

Unit Prototype and Economics
We design our restaurant prototypes to provide a relaxed atmosphere for our guests, while also focusing on restaurant-level returns over time. Our current prototypical Texas Roadhouse restaurants consist of a freestanding building with approximately 7,600 square feet of space constructed on sites of approximately 1.5 to 2.2 acres or retail pad sites, with seating of approximately 58 to 68 tables for a total of 270 to 300 guests, including 18 bar seats, and

parking for approximately 160 vehicles either on-site or in combination with some form of off-site cross parking arrangement. Our current prototypes are adaptable to in-line and end-cap locations and/or spaces within an enclosed mall or a shopping center. Our current prototypical Bubba’s 33 restaurants consist of a freestanding building with approximately 7,500 square feet of space with seating for approximately 270 guests.
In response to the pandemic, we made building modifications to a number of existing restaurants. These changes were made to better accommodate the increase in our To-Go sales and/or expand our outdoor dining arrangements. We are currently evaluating the possibility of integrating these changes into our prototypical Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33 restaurant designs.
As of December 29, 2020, we leased 389 properties and owned 148 properties. Our 2020 average unit volume for all Texas Roadhouse company restaurants open before June 25, 2019 was $4.6 million. The time required for a new Texas Roadhouse restaurant to reach a steady level of cash flow is approximately three to six months. For 2020, the average capital investment, including pre-opening expenses and a capitalized rent factor, for the 18 Texas Roadhouse company restaurants opened during the year was $6.2 million, broken down as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------+---+--------------+-----------+-----+---+-----------+---+---+-----------+--
​ | | Average Cost | | Low | | High | 
Land(1) | ​ | $ | 1,515,000 | ​ | $ | 1,100,000 | ​ | $ | 1,950,000 | ​

(2) | Includes site work costs.
----+--------------------------


(3) | Primarily liquor licensing costs, where applicable. This cost varies based on the licensing requirements in each state.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For 2020 and 2019, our average capital investment for the Texas Roadhouse restaurants was $6.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively. The increase in our 2020 average capital investment was primarily due to higher land and building costs. The higher land costs were due to increased rent amounts at several sites. The higher building costs were due to higher material costs and construction delays related to the pandemic. We expect our average capital investment for restaurants to be opened in 2021 to be approximately $5.5 million. 
Our average capital investment for the Bubba’s 33 restaurants opened in 2020 and 2019 was $7.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The increase in our 2020 average capital investment for our Bubba’s 33 restaurants was primarily due to higher building costs, in particular at one site in a more expensive area. We expect our average capital investment for restaurants to be opened in 2021 to be approximately $6.9 million. 
We remain focused on driving sales and managing restaurant investment costs in order to maintain our restaurant development in the future. Our capital investment (including cash and non-cash costs) for new restaurants varies significantly depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to: the square footage, layout, scope of required site work, geographical location, type of construction labor (union or non-union), local permitting requirements, our ability to negotiate with landowners and/or landlords, cost of liquor and other licenses and hook-up fees.
Site Selection
We continue to refine our site selection process. In analyzing each prospective site, our real estate team, as well as our restaurant market partners, devotes significant time and resources to the evaluation of local market demographics, population density, household income levels and site-specific characteristics such as visibility, accessibility, traffic generators, proximity of other retail activities and competitors, traffic counts and parking. We work actively with experienced real estate brokers in target markets to select high quality sites and to maintain and regularly update our database of potential sites. We typically require three to six months to locate, approve and control a restaurant site and typically six to 12 additional months to obtain necessary permits. Upon receipt of permits, we require approximately five months to construct, equip and open a restaurant.
