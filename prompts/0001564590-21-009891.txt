Item 1. Business.
ORGANIZATION
 McAfee Corp. (the “Corporation”) (or the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware on July 19, 2019. The Corporation was formed for the purpose of completing an initial public offering (“IPO”) and related transactions in order to carry on the business of Foundation Technology Worldwide LLC (“FTW”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (the Corporation, FTW and its subsidiaries are collectively the “Company”). On October 21, 2020, the Corporation became the sole managing member and holder of 100% of the voting power of FTW due to the Reorganization Transactions. With respect to the Corporation and the Company, each entity owns only the respective entities below it in the corporate structure and each entity has no other material operations, assets, or liabilities. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a detailed discussion of the Reorganization Transactions, as defined in that footnote, and the IPO.
OVERVIEW 
 McAfee has been a pioneer and leader in protecting consumers, enterprises, and governments from cyberattacks for more than 30 years with integrated security, privacy, and trust solutions. We built our platform through a deep, rich history of innovation and have established a leading global brand. Whether we are securing the digital experience of a consumer who is increasingly living life online, or defending many of the world’s largest enterprises and governments from sophisticated attacks and nation-state threats, McAfee is singularly committed to one mission: to protect all things that matter through leading-edge cybersecurity. 
 We live in a digital world. Consumers are increasingly mobile, interacting through multiple devices, networks and platforms, while leveraging technology as they work, socialize, consume and transact. Remote work and increasing work from home arrangements are driving a pronounced convergence of work and personal life. This lifestyle shift has been accompanied by a more challenging threat landscape and an increase in points of vulnerability, risking individuals’ privacy, identity, data and other vital resources. Similarly, enterprises embracing employee mobility, work from home strategies, bring your own device, and greater cloud adoption are facing a broader attack surface and dissolving network perimeter. These drivers have amplified the number of workloads across endpoints, making it challenging for enterprises to monitor and protect all of their workloads and applications. This challenge, coupled with an increase in cyberthreats, has heightened the importance of the consumer in making security decisions for their converged digital lives. 
 We secure the digital experience against cyberthreats, using threat intelligence capabilities developed through the scale and diversity of our sensor network. Our sensor network includes our customers’ endpoints, networks, gateways, and clouds which generate massive amounts of data that we translate into actionable, real-time insights. The platform is continuously enriched by artificial intelligence, machine learning and the telemetry gathered from over one billion sensors across our consumer, enterprise, and government customer base. Our vast and dynamic data set and advanced analytics capabilities enable us to provide defense for advanced zero-day threats by training machine learning models on the over 60 billion threat queries we receive each day. McAfee simplifies the complexity of threat detection and response by correlating events, detecting new threats, reducing false positives, automating and prioritizing incident response, and creating workflows that guide analysts through remediation. Protecting our customers has been the foundation of our success, enabling us to maintain an industry-leading reputation among our customers and partners. 
 For 30 years, consumers, enterprises and governments have turned to McAfee as a leader in cybersecurity services. Our Personal Protection Service provides holistic digital protection for an individual or family at home, on the go, and on the web. Our platform includes device security, privacy and safe Wi-Fi, online protection, and identity protection, creating a seamless and integrated digital moat. With a single interface, simple set up and ease of use, consumers obtain immediate time-to-value whether on a computer, smartphone or tablet, and across multiple operating systems. For enterprises and governments, we offer a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that protects our customers against adversarial threats across cloud, on-premise, hybrid environments and endpoint devices. Our cloud-native MVISION platform offers true device-to-cloud protection with threat detection and data protection for devices, secure access service edge (“SASE”) solutions for the multi-cloud, centralized policy orchestration, automated threat response, and threat insights generated by our predictive analytics engine.

Our consumer digitally-led omni channel go-to-market strategy has reached the consumer at crucial moments in their purchase lifecycle resulting in the protection of over 600 million devices as of December 26, 2020. We have longstanding exclusive partnerships with many of the leading PC original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and increasingly with mobile and internet service providers (“ISPs”) as the demand for mobile security protection increases. Through many of these relationships, our consumer security software is pre-installed on devices on a trial basis until conversion to a paid subscription. Our consumer go-to-market channel also includes some of the largest electronics retailers globally. Our enterprise business protects many of the largest enterprises and governments around the world. These include 86%, 77%, and 60% of Fortune 100, Fortune 500, and Global 2000 firms, respectively, as of December 26, 2020. Our large-government accounts represent over 25% of our 250 largest Enterprise customers and over 45% of our top 250 Enterprise customer annualized contract value in fiscal year 2020, with an average tenure of nearly 20 years. We primarily engage our enterprise and government customers with our direct sales force, while mid-market customers generally conduct their business through our channel partners. We operate a global business, with 45% of our fiscal 2020 net revenue earned outside of the United States. 
 In 2017, investment funds affiliated with or advised by TPG Global, LLC (“TPG”) and Thoma Brovo, L.P. (“Thoma Bravo”) (collectively “Sponsors”) acquired a controlling interest in McAfee, accelerating our transformational journey to optimize and reinforce our cybersecurity platform. Over the years, we have invested in new routes to market and partnerships for the consumer business, and rationalized our enterprise portfolio by divesting our network firewall, email, and vulnerability management businesses to reorient our focus and resources to products that align with our device-to-cloud strategy. We launched MVISION, the cloud-native family of our platform that offers threat defense, management, automation, and orchestration across devices, networks, clouds (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS), and on-premises environments. We have also made multiple operational changes designed to increase efficiency in our product delivery and go-to-market strategies. These efforts included the transformation of our performance marketing through a digital first approach focused on new customer acquisition, channel led conversion and overall customer retention, through our PC led product experience and consumer application development programs. Our investments in our platform and strategy have reinforced our market leadership, and we intend to continue innovating to protect our customers.

 INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 
 We live in an increasingly digitally interconnected and mobile world that is driving profound changes in both personal and business environments. This evolution is forcing consumers, enterprises and governments to react to the following trends:
 Online adoption use is global and continues to grow. According to IDC, there were over 4 billion Internet users in 2020, of which the number of mobile-only Internet users is expected to grow at an approximate 8% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2020 to 2024. Furthermore, Frost & Sullivan estimates there were over 6 billion Internet-connected devices worldwide in 2020. This significant growth in the mobile install base is driving the ubiquity of the Internet and online browsing. 
 The global consumer is completing more of their everyday routine online, expanding their digital footprint. Consumers are more comfortable engaging in critical transactions on mobile devices and their PCs. At the same time, they are rapidly expanding their social interactions and media consumption online, while shifting data storage to cloud-based solutions to store personal photos and large amounts of data that is accessible across any endpoint device. While unlocking consumers’ digital lives allows for convenience, using a greater number of digital platforms increases the surface area that cybercriminals can use to access personal data. 
 5


Increased attack surface results in high risk of being hacked and critical data used for profit. Cyberattacks have evolved from rudimentary malware into highly sophisticated, organized and large-scale attacks targeting consumers, governments, and a broad range of industries. According to RiskBased Security, during 2020, nearly 4,000 data breaches were reported, resulting in over 37 billion records being exposed. We have seen the number of threats from external actors targeting cloud services increase approximately 630% from January 2020 to April 2020. Enterprises need to protect themselves from increasing ransomware attacks which have generated billions of dollars in payments to cybercriminals and inflicted significant damage and expenses for consumers, businesses and governments. 
 Workplace digital transformation is driving increased use of cloud-based applications and personal devices, challenging traditional enterprise defenses. The development of cloud-based SaaS applications and bring-your-own-device adoption has enabled the enterprise employee to bring their professional lives online and into the home. Furthermore, the rapid adoption of cloud applications has increased organizations’ attack surface by moving both threats and sensitive data away from the traditional network perimeter, reducing the effectiveness of many existing security products. As a result, cyberattacks have shifted from not just targeting enterprise infrastructure but also people. 
  
• | Complexity of the IT environment and dissolution of the enterprise perimeter. According to IDC, spending on cloud IT infrastructure including cloud software is expected to be approximately $272 billion in 2020, and grow at a CAGR of 19% from 2020 to 2024.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Loss of visibility and control. As devices proliferate and perimeters dissolve, organizations are losing visibility and control of data in their environment. Increasingly, enterprise environments are comprised of a mix of clouds, networks, and devices, forcing the enterprise to manage data security policies across heterogeneous, multi-cloud footprint in order to avoid breaches and demonstrate regulatory compliance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobility of the workforce. IDC estimates the mobile worker population in the United States will exceed 93 million by 2024, representing 60% of the total U.S. workforce. This increases the number of malware incidents.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Third party access. Enterprises rely on third parties to help complete certain functions or processes. Providing enterprise network access and data to third parties further increases the potential for data breaches.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Data and IT infrastructure are increasingly interdependent and require comprehensive protection solutions. Primary adversarial threat vectors may consistently apply to either data or networks. Cybersecurity victims may find their data or networks held for ransom (ransomware), denied, exploited, or lost. As adversarial tactics and techniques converge to compromise data or networks, defensive technologies must also holistically apply to data protection and threat defense. 
  
• | Data protection. Data is one of the most important corporate assets, making it a top target for cyber criminals. Enterprises need a centralized solution that automatically enforces and updates a consistent policy to protect data, in the cloud, corporate endpoints, networks, and unmanaged devices.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Threat defense. The volume and sophistication of cyberattacks continues to increase at a rapid pace. Enterprises need a consistent threat defense across endpoint, network, web, and cloud domains to defend against cyberattacks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is a need for integrated device-to-cloud cybersecurity solutions that secure consumers, enterprises and governments in a connected world by offering the following:
 
• | Comprehensive and convenient security solutions to protect consumers across their digital footprint. Consumers have an increasingly expanding digital presence as they access different online platforms and apps. These daily online interactions require solutions that are designed to meet consumers’ anti-malware, identity, and privacy protection needs at scale.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer protection powered by seamless digital experience across device platforms. Consumers require holistic digital protection for themselves, their families, and their data across devices and platforms whether they are at home, at work, or on the go. This requires an interface that is simple to set up and use, and provides ongoing protection without hampering device performance and consumer’s digital experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer products to address privacy needs. A growing online presence exposes more personal and financial data that is targeted by malicious hackers. According to Identity Theft Resource Center, more than 490 million individuals were affected by data breaches in 2019 at an estimated cost of $600 billion. Users are increasingly mobile, and thus at a higher risk of connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi connection, requiring virtual private network (“VPN”) solutions to secure personally identifiable information over unsecured networks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data protection and threat defense for heterogeneous, multi-cloud IT and hybrid environments. With the growing reliance on cloud, new threat vectors have emerged, requiring enterprises and governments to have both device-to-cloud and on premise solutions that protect data and defend against threats across heterogeneous devices and clouds, rather than relying on traditional corporate network boundaries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Comprehensive threat intelligence leveraging a unique global sensor network. Consumers, enterprises, and governments require comprehensive threat intelligence that can gather massive amounts of data from multiple domains and devices and translate that data into actionable, real-time insights to protect against the evolving tactics and techniques of cybercriminals. It is challenging for cybersecurity vendors to accomplish this without a systematic approach that integrates real-time data collection, machine learning model training and feedback across billions of sensors deployed with consumer, enterprise, and government customers and across multiple defense domains (endpoint, network, gateway, and cloud).

 Real collaboration, innovation, and impact happens in workplaces where you can express yourself authentically. That’s why we work hard to ensure life at McAfee is one where our employees can be authentic, engage with others, and reach the best versions of themselves, both at the office and away from it:
  
• | Because each person plays a role, McAfee employees included an inclusion goal as part of their individual goals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We sponsor 6 McAfee Communities to support members and allies within each of our African Heritage, Veterans, Latino, Women, LGBTQ, and Differently Abled communities
