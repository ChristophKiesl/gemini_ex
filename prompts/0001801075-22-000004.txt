ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
We have conducted business from our headquarters in Galveston, Texas since 1905. Our core business segments are life insurance, annuities, and property and casualty insurance. We also offer limited health insurance. We provide personalized service to approximately six million policyholders throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we have over $136.9 billion of life insurance in-force.
On July 1, 2020, American National Insurance Company, a Texas insurance company (“ANICO”), completed its previously announced holding company reorganization, which was approved by its shareholders at its Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 23, 2020. As a result of such reorganization, ANICO became a wholly owned subsidiary of American National Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ANAT”), and ANAT replaced ANICO as the publicly held company. Consequently, all filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from July 2, 2020 forward have been filed by ANAT under CIK No. 0001801075. 
On August 6, 2021, ANAT entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Partners Ltd. ("Brookfield Reinsurance"), an exempted company limited by shares existing under the laws of Bermuda, and Freestone Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance ("Merger Sub"). On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing, Merger Sub will merge with and into ANAT (the "Merger"), with ANAT continuing as the surviving entity, which will become an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Reinsurance. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of the Company's common stock will be converted into the right to receive $190.00 in cash without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), for total Merger Consideration of approximately $5.1 billion. The Merger was unanimously approved by the ANAT's board of directors. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information regarding the Merger. 
In this document, we refer to ANAT and its subsidiaries as "American National," the "Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us.”
Our vision is to be a leading provider of financial products and services for current and future generations. For more than a century, we have maintained a conservative business approach and corporate culture.

We are committed to profitable growth, which enables us to remain financially strong. We invest regularly in our distribution channels, technology, and our human resources to fuel our capacity for profitable growth.
We are committed to excellence and maintaining high ethical standards in all our business dealings. Disciplined adherence to our values has allowed us to deliver consistently high levels of service through talented people, who are at the heart of our business. We define our values with the acronym FIRST, which stands for Financial strength, Integrity, Respect, Service, and Teamwork. Additionally, we describe our culture as ACE which stands for Agility, Collaboration, and Engagement, three characteristics that describe how we want to operate as a team dedicated to the success of our stakeholders. In 2021, we instituted ACE Culture 2.0 with additional emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Business Segments
Our family of companies includes five life insurance companies, eight property and casualty insurance companies, and numerous non-insurance subsidiaries. We organize and operate our businesses in the following business segments: Life, Annuity, Property and Casualty, Health, and Corporate and Other. The following discussion provides an overview of the products we offer within these segments.
ITEM 1. BUSINESS — (Continued)

Life Segment
Whole Life. Whole life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured in return for the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of the contract, to a specified age or a fixed number of years, and may be level or change in accordance with a predetermined schedule. Whole life insurance includes some policies that provide a participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death benefits or cash values available upon surrender, or reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force. 
Term Life. Term life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Coverage periods typically range from one to thirty years, but in no event longer than the period over which premiums are paid. 
Universal Life. Universal life insurance products provide coverage through a contract that gives the policyholder flexibility in premium payments and coverage amounts. Universal life products may allow the policyholder, within certain limits, to increase or decrease the amount of death benefit coverage over the term of the contract and to adjust the frequency and amount of premium payments. Universal life products are interest rate sensitive, and we determine the interest crediting rates during the contract period, subject to policy specific minimums.
An equity-indexed universal life product is credited with interest using a return that is based, in part, on changes in an index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (“S&P 500”), subject to a specified minimum.
Variable Universal Life. Variable universal life products provide insurance coverage on a similar basis as universal life, except that the policyholder bears the investment risk because the value of the policyholder’s account balance varies with the investment experience of the securities selected by the policyholder held in the separate account.
Credit Life Insurance. Credit life insurance products are sold in connection with a loan or other credit account. Credit life insurance products are designed to pay to the lender the borrower’s remaining debt on a loan or credit account if the borrower dies during the coverage period.
Annuity Segment
Deferred Annuity. A deferred annuity is an asset accumulation product. Deposits are received as a single premium deferred annuity or in a series of payments for a flexible premium deferred annuity. Deposits are credited with interest at our determined rates subject to policy minimums. For certain limited periods of time, usually from one to ten years, interest rates are guaranteed not to change. Deferred annuities usually have surrender charges that begin at issue and reduce over time and may have market value adjustments that can increase or decrease any surrender value.
An equity-indexed deferred annuity is credited with interest using a return that is based, in part, on changes in an index, such as the S&P 500, subject to a specified minimum.
Single Premium Immediate Annuity (“SPIA”). A SPIA is purchased with one premium payment, providing periodic (usually monthly or annual) payments to the annuitant for a specified period, such as for the remainder of the annuitant’s life. Return of the original deposit may or may not be guaranteed, depending on the terms of the annuity contract. 
Variable Annuity. With a variable annuity, the policyholder bears the investment risk because the value of the policyholder’s account balance varies with the investment experience of the separate account investment options selected by the policyholder. Our variable annuity products have no guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits.
ITEM 1. BUSINESS — (Continued)

Health Segment 
Medicare Supplement. Medicare supplement insurance is a type of private health insurance designed to supplement or pay the costs of certain medical services not covered by Medicare. Due to competitive pressures and a marketing shift toward more profitable lines of business, we are completing the process of withdrawing from the Medicare Supplement market. New business sales ceased as of January 31, 2022. Going forward, existing policies will be in run-off and lapse at the end of the policy period. 
Supplemental Insurance. Supplemental insurance is designed to provide supplemental coverage for specific events or illnesses such as cancer, accidental injury or death, or disability for short periods of time. 
Stop-Loss. Stop-loss coverage is used by employers to limit their exposure under self-insured medical plans. Two coverages, which are usually offered concurrently, are available. Specific stop-loss provides coverage when claims for an individual reach a threshold; after the threshold is reached, the policy reimburses claims paid by the employer up to a coverage limit for each individual. Aggregate stop-loss reimburses the employer once the group’s total paid claims reach a threshold.
Credit Disability. Credit disability (also called credit health) insurance pays a limited number of monthly payments on a loan or credit account if the borrower becomes disabled during the coverage period.
Medical Expense. Medical expense insurance covers most health expenses including hospitalization, surgery, and outpatient services (excluding dental and vision costs). We no longer market these products and existing contracts are in run-off.
Short-Term Medical Insurance. Short-term medical provides temporary medical expense coverage for policyholders between jobs, waiting for other coverages to begin, or currently without other medical expense coverage. Under current federal regulation, short-term medical may be renewed up to 36 months. 
Property and Casualty Segment
Personal Lines. Personal lines include insurance policies sold to individuals for auto, homeowners, and other similar exposures. Auto insurance covers specific risks involved in owning and operating an automobile. Homeowners insurance provides coverage that protects the insured owner’s property against loss from perils. Other personal insurance provides coverage for property such as boats, motorcycles and recreational vehicles, and umbrella protection coverage.
Commercial Lines. Commercial lines are primarily focused on providing insurance to agricultural related operations and small to midsize businesses. This includes property and casualty coverage tailored for a farm, ranch, or other agricultural-related businesses. Commercial auto insurance is typically issued in conjunction with the sale of our policies covering farms, ranches, and businesses and covers specific risks involved in owning and operating motor vehicles. Business owners' property and liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and other commercial insurance encompassing umbrella protection coverage and other liability coverages, are also offered.
Specialty Markets. Specialty markets products include renters, mortgage security, aviation, private flood, and credit insurance. Credit insurance provides protection to borrowers and the creditors that extend credit to them against unpaid indebtedness as a result of death, disability, involuntary unemployment, or untimely loss to the collateral securing a personal or mortgage loan. Coverage available for the segment includes:
•Collateral or Creditor Protection Insurance (“CPI”). CPI provides insurance against loss, expense to recover, or damage to personal property pledged as collateral (typically automobiles and homes) resulting from fire, burglary, collision, or other loss occurrence that would either impair a creditor’s interest or adversely affect the value of the collateral. The coverage is purchased from us by the lender according to the terms of the credit obligation and charged to the borrower by the lender when the borrower fails to provide the required insurance.
•Guaranteed Auto Protection or Guaranteed Asset Protection (“GAP”). GAP insures the excess outstanding indebtedness over the primary property insurance benefits that may occur when there is a total loss to or an unrecovered theft of the collateral. GAP can be written on a variety of assets that are used as collateral to secure credit; however, it is most commonly written on automobiles.
ITEM 1. BUSINESS — (Continued)

Corporate and Other Segment 
Our Corporate and Other segment includes our non-insurance subsidiaries and other invested assets not matched with insurance activities. 
Marketing Channels
Our diversified product distribution network is designed to satisfy the needs of the markets we serve. 
Career Sales and Service Division (“CSSD”)—can be traced to the Company's founding in 1905, and offers life insurance, annuities, and limited benefit health insurance products through employee agents primarily to the lower and middle-income market. CSSD's business model is structured to enable agents located throughout the United States to efficiently distribute new products and provide personalized service to the customer. CSSD has evolved its operations to offer a wider variety of products and electronic processing to meet the ever-changing needs of the customer and the agents that serve them.
Independent Marketing Group (“IMG”)—distributes our life insurance and annuity products and solutions through independent agents, financial institutions, large marketing organizations, employee benefit firms, broker-dealers and brokers. IMG provides these products and services to clients in need of wealth protection, accumulation, distribution, and transfer. IMG also markets to individuals who favor purchasing life insurance directly from an insurance company, through call centers. 
Multiple Line Agencies—offers life insurance, annuities, and property and casualty insurance and a limited amount of health insurance primarily through agents, who, for the most part, primarily or exclusively represent the Company. This distribution channel serves individuals, families, farmers, ranchers, other agricultural clients, and small business owners across the country. Policyholders can generally obtain all their insurance solutions through our multiple line agents, which has been identified as an important driver to client satisfaction.
Health Insurance Division—serves the needs of a variety of markets including middle-income seniors, self-insured employers, and the special needs of individuals with supplemental products which are sold direct to consumer, and by independent agents, brokers, and Managing General Underwriters (“MGU”). The Health Insurance Division primarily offers health insurance products, supplemental health insurance products, health reinsurance, and traditional medicare supplement products. 
Specialty Markets Group ("SMG")—primarily offers property and casualty products, including some credit property and casualty products. Credit product distribution includes general agents who market to financial institutions, automobile dealers, and furniture dealers. Our SMG distribution channel also provides property and casualty products for renters, mortgage security, aviation for small hull aircraft, self-storage contents, and private flood insurance through general agents and managing general agents. Some of the products distributed by SMG, including aviation and private flood, are fully reinsured. In addition, SMG sells some credit life and credit disability products. 
Policyholder Liabilities 
We record the amounts for policyholder liabilities in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and the standards of practice of the American Academy of Actuaries. We carry liabilities for future policy benefits associated with base policies and riders, unearned mortality charges and future disability benefits, for other policyholder liabilities associated with unearned premiums and claims payable, and for unearned revenue from front-end fees. We also establish liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported. In addition, we carry liabilities for secondary guarantees relating to certain life policies and fair value reserves associated with embedded derivatives on equity-indexed products. 
Additional information regarding our policyholder liabilities may be found in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates — Reserves section, and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 11, Liability for Future Policy Benefits and Policyholder Account Balances, and Note 12, Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS — (Continued)

Risk Management
A conservative operating philosophy was a founding principle for our Company and continues to be a guiding principle for us. We manage risks across the Company by employing controls throughout our business operations. These controls are designed to both place limits on activities and provide internal reporting information that helps us monitor our businesses and shape decisions and actions. The Company’s Board of Directors oversees a formal enterprise risk management program to coordinate risk management efforts and to provide reasonable assurance that risk taking activities are aligned with strategic objectives. The Board Audit Committee assists the Board in its risk management oversight. The risk management program includes a Corporate Risk Officer to ensure consistent application of the enterprise risk management process across all business segments. The Enterprise Risk Management Committee is supported by three sub-committees, one focusing on life and annuity business risks, one focusing on property and casualty business risks, and another focusing on health and credit life business risks. In addition, several other senior management committees support the discussion and enforcement of risk controls in the management of the Company. 
Our insurance products are designed to balance features desired by the marketplace with provisions that mitigate our risk exposures across our insurance products portfolio. We employ underwriting standards to help ensure proper rates are charged to different classes of risks. In our life insurance and annuity products, we seek to mitigate disintermediation risk, the risk of large outflows of cash at times when it is disadvantageous to us to dispose of invested assets, with surrender charges and market value adjustment features. 
The process of linking the timing and the amount of payment obligations related to our insurance and annuity contracts and the cash flows and valuations of the invested assets supporting those obligations is commonly referred to as asset-liability management (“ALM”). Our ALM Committee, including many of our Company's senior executive officers, regularly monitors the level of risk in the interaction of assets and liabilities and helps shape actions intended to attain our desired risk-return profile. Investment allocations and duration targets are also intended to manage the risk exposure in our annuity products by setting the credited rate within a range supported by our investments. Tools that help shape investment decisions include deterministic and stochastic interest rate scenario analyses using a licensed third-party economic scenario generator and detailed insurance ALM models. These models also use experience related to surrenders and claims. 
We also manage risk by purchasing reinsurance to limit exposure in our Life, Health, and Property and Casualty segments. In our Life segment, we currently retain 100% of newly developed permanent and term products up to our retention limit and cede the excess exposure to reinsurers that are evaluated for their credit strength. Consistent with our corporate risk management strategy, we periodically adjust our Life reinsurance program and retention limits as market conditions warrant. In our Health segment, we use reinsurance on an excess of loss basis for our MGU stop-loss business. In our Property and Casualty segment, our reinsurance program provides coverage for some individual risks with exposures above certain amounts as well as exposure to catastrophes including hurricanes, tornadoes, wind and hail events, earthquakes, fires following earthquakes, winter storms, and wildfires. In all segments, we purchase reinsurance from multiple providers and regularly review the financial strength ratings of our reinsurers. Reinsurance does not remove our liability to pay our policyholders, and we remain liable to our policyholders for the risks we insure. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for retention limits.
In our Property and Casualty segment, the use of catastrophic event models is an important element of risk management. These models assist in the measurement and management of exposure concentrations and the amount and structure of reinsurance purchases. In addition to reinsurance, we manage exposure to catastrophic risk by limiting property exposure in areas with heightened brush fire risks and exposures and in coastal areas, implementing hurricane, wind and hail deductible requirements where appropriate, and not renewing coverage, when permitted by applicable law, in regions where we believe exposure to risky events exceeds our risk appetite. 
Pricing
We establish premium rates for life, annuity, and health products using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, investments, and expenses, all of which are estimates generally based on our experience, industry data, projected investment earnings, competition, regulation and legislation. These assumptions are also considered when setting crediting rates for interest sensitive life and annuity products. Premium rates for property and casualty insurance are influenced by many factors, including the estimated frequency and severity of claims, expenses, state regulation and legislation, and general business and economic conditions, including market interest rates and inflation. Profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from our pricing assumptions. 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS — (Continued)

Payments we receive for certain annuity and life products are not recognized as revenues, but are deposits added to policyholder account balances. Revenues from these products result from charges to the account balances for the cost of insurance risk and administrative fees and, in some cases, surrender fees. Profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income on assets invested from the deposits in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders. 
Premiums for health policies with medical expense components must take into account the rising utilization and cost of medical care. The annual rate of medical cost inflation has historically been higher than the general rate of inflation, requiring frequent rate increases, most of which are subject to approval by state regulatory agencies. 
Credit life and health rates are set by each state. These rates are the maximum amounts that may be charged. We may charge a lower rate to reflect a variety of factors including better than expected experience, compensation adjustments, and competitive forces. If an account's experience is poor and less than our pricing assumptions, we may request a rate increase from the applicable state.
Competition
We compete principally on the breadth of our product offerings, reputation, the overall ease of doing business with us, marketing expertise and support, the scope of our distribution systems, financial strength and ratings, product features and prices, customer service, claims handling, and in the case of producers, service as well as compensation. The market for insurance, retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. We compete with a large number of domestic and foreign insurance companies, many of which offer one or more similar products. In addition, for products that include an asset accumulation component, our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms, investment advisors, mutual funds, banks, and other financial institutions.
Several competing insurance carriers are larger than we are, have brands that are more commonly known, and spend significantly more on advertising than we do. We endeavor to remain competitive with these commonly known brands by managing costs, providing attractive coverage and service, maintaining positive relationships with our agents and our policyholders, and by maintaining our financial strength.
Ratings
Rating agencies provide independent opinions or ratings. These ratings are based on each rating agency’s quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company. The rating agencies do not provide ratings as a recommendation to purchase insurance or annuities, nor as a guarantee of an insurer’s current or future ability to meet contractual obligations. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings may be changed, suspended, or withdrawn at any time. 
ANICO's current insurer financial strength rating from two of the most widely referenced rating organizations as of the date of this filing are as follows:
•A.M. Best Company: A (Excellent) (1)
•Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”): A (Strong) (2)
(1)A.M. Best's active company rating scale consists of thirteen ratings ranging from A++ (Superior) to D (poor). 
(2)S&P’s active company ratings scale ‘AAA’ to ‘R’ may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.
A.M. Best has placed American National’s issuer credit and financial strength ratings under review with developing implications and S&P Global Ratings has placed the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications due to the pending Merger with Brookfield Reinsurance. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional details.
ITEM 1. BUSINESS — (Continued)

Regulations Applicable to Our Business
Our insurance operations are subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. Such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish requirements for the business of insurance and that grant broad regulatory authority to a state agency. Insurance regulation has a substantial effect on us and governs a wide variety of matters, such as insurance company licensing, agent and adjuster licensing, policy benefits, price setting, accounting practices, product suitability, the payment of dividends, the nature and amount of investments, underwriting practices, reserve requirements, sales and advertising practices, privacy practices, information systems security, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, risk and solvency assessments, mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance practices, capital adequacy, transactions with affiliates, participation in shared markets and guaranty associations, claims practices, the remittance of unclaimed property, and enterprise risk management requirements. The models for state laws and regulations often emanate from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). While it is not mandatory for insurers to comply with an NAIC model law, nor for states to adopt a model law, state and federal legislators and regulators are likely to look to the model law for guidance in proposing new legislation and regulation.
State insurance departments monitor compliance with regulations through periodic reporting procedures and examinations. At any given time, financial, market conduct or other examinations of our insurance companies may be occurring. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) expanded the U.S. federal government presence in insurance oversight. Dodd-Frank also established the Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of Treasury, which is authorized to, among other things, gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify certain issues in the regulation of insurers, and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances. Provisions of Dodd-Frank are or may become applicable to us, our competitors, or certain entities with which we do business. For example, it is possible that regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may extend, or be interpreted to extend, to the sale of certain insurance products by covered financial institutions, which could adversely affect sales of such products. The Federal Insurance Office, as a result of various studies it conducts, may also recommend changes in laws or regulations that affect our business. There may be further federal involvement in the business of insurance in the future, which may add significant legal complexity and associated costs to our business. 
Regulatory matters having the most significant effects on our insurance operations and financial reporting are described further below. In addition, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Litigation and Regulation Risk Factors, below discusses significant risks presented to our business by extensive regulation and describes certain other laws and regulations that are or may become applicable to us.
Holding Company Regulation. We are an insurance holding company system under the insurance laws of the states where we do business. Our insurance companies are organized under the laws of Texas, Missouri, New York, Louisiana, and California. Insurance holding company system laws and regulations in such states generally require periodic reporting to state insurance regulators of various business, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, and financial matters, as well as advance notice to, and in some cases approval by, such regulators prior to certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates. These laws also generally require regulatory approval prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in an insurance company. These requirements may deter or delay certain transactions considered desirable by management or our stockholders. 
Limitations on Dividends by Insurance Subsidiaries. Dividends received from ANICO are the sole source of cash for ANAT. ANICO and its insurance subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends is generally limited by state law and is also impacted by federal income tax considerations. Our insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends is important to ANAT's ability to pay dividends to shareholders. 
Rate Regulation. Nearly all states have laws that require life, health, credit, and property and casualty insurers to file rate schedules and require most insurers to file policy or coverage forms and other information with the state’s insurance regulatory authority. In many cases these must be approved prior to use. The objectives of rate laws vary, but generally a price cannot be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. Prohibitions on discriminatory underwriting practices apply in the context of certain products as well. 
Our ability to adjust premium rates, particularly with certain property and casualty and health insurance products, is often dependent on the applicable pricing law and our ability to demonstrate to the particular regulator that current or proposed pricing complies with such law. Rate increases that we believe are necessary for our profitability may be delayed or denied as a result of such laws. We manage our risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing insurance products and by being selective in underwriting. When a state has significant underwriting and pricing restrictions, it becomes more difficult to manage our risk of loss, which can adversely impact our ability to market products profitably in such states. 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS — (Continued)

Guaranty Associations and Involuntary Markets. State laws allow insurers to be assessed, subject to prescribed limits, insurance guaranty fund fees to pay certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. In addition, to maintain our licenses to write property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various insurance coverages to purchasers that otherwise are unable to obtain coverage from private insurers. 
Investment Regulation. Insurance company investment regulations require investment portfolio diversification and limit the amount of investment in certain asset categories. Failure to comply with these regulations leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for measuring statutory surplus. In some instances, these rules require the sale of non-conforming investments. 
Exiting Geographic Markets, Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies. Most states regulate an insurer’s ability to exit a market by limiting the ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to an approved plan. These regulations can restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. 
Statutory Accounting. Financial reports to state insurance regulators utilize statutory accounting practices as defined in the Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual of the NAIC, which are different from GAAP. Statutory accounting practices, in keeping with the intent to assure the protection of policyholders, are generally based on a solvency concept, while GAAP is based on a going-concern concept. While not a substitute for GAAP performance measures, statutory information is used by industry analysts and reporting sources to compare the performance of insurance companies and impacts the ability of insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to ANAT. Maintaining both GAAP and statutory financial records increases our business costs. 
Pursuant to state insurance laws, we establish statutory reserves, which are reported as liabilities in the separate stand-alone statutory-basis financial statements of ANAT's insurance subsidiaries, and which generally differ from future policy benefits determined using GAAP on our respective policies. These statutory reserves are established in amounts sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at prescribed rates. 
Insurance Reserves. State insurance laws require life and property and casualty insurers to annually analyze the adequacy of statutory reserves. Our appointed actuaries must submit opinions annually for our insurance companies that policyholder and claim reserves are adequate.
Risk-Based Capital and Solvency Requirements. The NAIC has a formula for analyzing capital levels of insurance companies called Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”). The RBC formula has minimum capital thresholds that vary with the size and mix of a company’s business and assets. It is designed to identify companies with capital levels that may require regulatory attention. As of December 31, 2021, the capital level of each of our insurance company subsidiaries exceeded 300% of their respective Authorized Control Levels, the minimum RBC requirement before any action level is triggered or considered.
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA"). The NAIC Risk Management and ORSA Model Act (#505) requires insurers to maintain a framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting on the “material and relevant risks” associated with the insurers' (or insurance groups') current and future business plans. The model act, which has been adopted by the state insurance regulators of our insurance companies, requires companies to file an internal assessment of their solvency with insurance regulators annually. Although no specific capital adequacy standard is currently articulated in the ORSA requirement, it is possible that such standard will be developed over time and may increase insurers' minimum capital requirements, which could adversely impact our growth and return on equity. Our own minimum capital requirement, the Defined Security Standard in our 2021 ORSA, is 200% of the 1-in-250 Conditional Tail Expectation event as measured by the American National Internal Capital Model. As of December 31, 2021, GAAP equity exceeds this minimum requirement.
Securities Regulation. The sale and administration of variable life insurance and variable annuities are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state level, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Our variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, other than group unallocated, were issued through separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Each registered separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund that is itself a registered investment company under such act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by the separate accounts generally are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. The U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities and FINRA, from time to time, make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding our compliance with securities and other laws and regulations. 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS — (Continued)

In addition, our periodic reports and proxy statements to stockholders are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and corresponding rules of the SEC, and our corporate governance processes are subject to regulation by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our registered wholesale broker-dealer and registered investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and, in some cases, state securities administrators.
Suitability. FINRA rules require broker-dealers selling variable insurance products to determine that transactions in such products are “suitable” to the circumstances of the particular customer. In addition, most states have enacted the NAIC’s Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation that, in adopting states, places suitability responsibilities on insurance companies in the sale of fixed and indexed annuities, including responsibilities for training agents. The NAIC has adopted revisions to this model regulation that would further elevate the standard of care for annuity sales and align it with the SEC's new Regulation Best Interest. Several states have either adopted the model regulation or are considering adopting the model regulation. We anticipate that the revised model will be adopted in some form by many of the states in which we do business. New York has already taken further action, through the adoption by the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") of a regulation that requires in part that life insurance policies and annuity contracts delivered or issued for delivery in New York be in the best interest of the consumer.
Protection of Consumer Information. U.S. federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLB"), and state laws regulate disclosures of certain customer information and require us to protect the security and confidentiality of such information. Such laws also require us to notify customers about our policies and practices relating to the collection, protection and disclosure of confidential customer information. State and federal laws, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), regulate our use, protection, and disclosure of certain personal health information. In addition, most states have laws or regulations that require us to notify regulators and affected customers in the event of a data breach, and some of these laws and regulations are becoming more stringent by requiring faster notifications and creating private causes of action for violations.
On June 28, 2018, California enacted a sweeping new privacy law known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). The CCPA requires enhanced customer disclosure about how a business collects and uses personal data, how such data is used in business processes, and with and to whom customer data is shared or sold. In addition, the CCPA also affords a consumer a “right to request deletion” in certain circumstances. On August 31, 2018, the California State Legislature passed SB-1121, a bill that delayed enforcement of the CCPA until July 1, 2020, and made other amendments and clarifications to the law. Such clarifications include exempting from certain requirements of the CCPA information that is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the California Financial Information Privacy Act, GLB, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"), HIPAA, or the federal Driver’s Privacy Protection Act. The revisions, however, do not exempt such information from the CCPA’s private right of action provision in all instances. Additionally, the definition of “personal information” in the CCPA is broad and may encompass other information that we maintain in our California business beyond that excluded under GLB, FCRA, HIPAA, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, or the California Financial Information Privacy Act exemption. In addition, in November 2020, California enacted the Consumer Privacy Rights Act, which is effective January 1, 2023 and grants new consumer rights regarding personal information and strengthens certain provisions of the CCPA. Other states may adopt comprehensive privacy laws like California. For example, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act ("CDPA"). On June 8, 2021, Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act ("CPA"). Both the CDPA and CPA give certain consumers data protections rights including the right to opt-out of processing their personal data, the right to delete information, and the right to correct information. The CDPA will go into effect on January 1, 2023 and CPA will go into effect on July 1, 2023. 
We anticipate further efforts at the federal and state levels to strengthen the protection of consumer information, and such efforts will continue to have a significant impact on our information practices. 
In addition, FCRA is a federal law that governs the use and sharing of consumer credit information provided by a consumer reporting agency. Requirements under FCRA apply to an insurer if such insurer obtains and uses consumer credit information to underwrite insurance. Such requirements may include obtaining the consumer’s consent and providing various notices to the consumer. While the use of consumer credit information in the underwriting process is expressly authorized by FCRA, various states have issued regulations that limit or prohibit the use of consumer credit information by insurers, and some consumer groups continue to criticize the use of credit-based insurance scoring in underwriting and rating processes. There may be additional efforts at the federal or state level to regulate the use of credit-based information by insurers. Any such regulation could force changes in our underwriting practices and impact our profitability.

Cybersecurity. In recent years, millions of consumers and businesses have been impacted by data breaches of companies in various industries, increasing the regulatory focus on consumer information protection and data privacy. On August 28, 2017, New York became the first state to adopt minimum cybersecurity standards for certain financial institutions. NYDFS requires financial institutions authorized to do business under New York banking, insurance, or other financial services laws, including certain of our subsidiaries, to develop a cybersecurity program and policy based on an assessment of the institution’s cybersecurity risks, designate a Chief Information Security Officer, maintain written policies and procedures with respect to third-party service providers, limit who has access to data or systems, use qualified cybersecurity personnel to manage cybersecurity risks, notify NYDFS of a cybersecurity event within seventy-two hours, maintain a written incident response plan, and provide NYDFS with an annual certification of compliance. 
In addition, the NAIC has adopted the Cybersecurity Bill of Rights, a set of directives aimed at protecting consumer data, and the Insurance Data Security Model Law, a model law patterned after New York's cybersecurity standards. The Insurance Data Security Model Law establishes standards for data security in the insurance industry, including standards for investigating a data breach and requiring certain notifications to regulators, producers and consumers. South Carolina became the first state to adopt the Insurance Data Security Model Law in May 2018. Since then, more states have adopted the model law in some form. In states that have not adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, it is not mandatory for insurers to comply with the model law; however, state and federal legislators and regulators are likely to look to the model law, as well as the NYDFS regulation, for guidance in proposing new legislation and regulation. The NAIC has also strengthened and enhanced the cybersecurity guidance included in its handbook for state insurance examiners. We expect a continuing focus at the state and federal levels on the privacy and security of personal information.
Anti-Money Laundering. Federal law and regulations require us to take certain steps to help prevent and detect money laundering activities. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency requirements applicable to certain financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Bank Secrecy Act requires insurers to implement a risk-based compliance program to detect, deter and (in some cases) report financial or other illicit crimes including, but not limited to, money laundering and terrorist financing. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), a division of the U.S. Treasury Department, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions. For certain transactions, an insurer may be required to search policyholder, agent, vendor and employee databases for specially designated nationals or suspected terrorists, in order to comply with OFAC obligations.
Healthcare Regulation. We are subject to various conditions and requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Healthcare Act”). The Healthcare Act affects the small blocks of business we have offered or acquired over the years that are, or are deemed to be, health insurance. The Healthcare Act also influences the design of products sold by our Health segment, which may influence consumer acceptance of such products and the cost of monitoring compliance with the Healthcare Act. Moreover, the Healthcare Act affects the benefit plans we sponsor for employees, retirees and their dependents, our expense to provide such benefits, our tax liabilities in connection with the provision of such benefits, and our ability to attract or retain employees. Any repeal, replacement or amendment of the Healthcare Act, or judicial decisions impacting the Healthcare Act, could have similar effects on us. 
Environmental Considerations. As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties. We routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment or through foreclosure, but we cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities. Based on information currently available to us, management believes that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any required remediation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
Other types of regulations that affect us include insurable interest laws, employee benefit plan laws, antitrust laws, employment and labor laws, and federal and state tax laws. Failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations may result in censure; the issuance of cease-and-desist orders; reputational damage; suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of our operations and/or our employees and agents; or the obligation to pay fines, penalties, assessments, interest, or additional taxes and wages. In some cases, severe penalties may be imposed for breach of these laws. We cannot predict the impact of these actions on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 4,545 employees in 45 states. Most employees work from one of our four primary office locations in Galveston, Texas; Springfield, Missouri; League City, Texas; and Glenmont, New York. As a result of COVID-19, a majority of employees have transitioned to a hybrid work model that combines on-premise and remote work. We also have employees working at other locations, primarily employees of our CSSD division, which has 57 district offices operating in 15 states. Approximately 985 of our employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement, the majority of whom are within CSSD. 
In addition to our employees, we have approximately 143,000 non-employee producers who are appointed by the Company to market specific products and insurance to the various markets we serve. These non-employee producers are vital to our long-term success in the financial services industry, which is a human-capital intensive business. As such, we support and monitor these relationships through our commitment to attracting, developing and retaining producers who are client-focused and align with our company values.
During 2021, the Company’s total employee voluntary turnover was less than 12.2%. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. We consider our employees to be the foundation for our continued growth and success through demonstration of our FIRST values and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which speak to who we are and define the expectation for how we conduct ourselves. 
Engagement. We periodically conduct employee surveys managed through a third-party vendor to capture the voice of our employees, to provide current data on the level of employee engagement, and to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement. Our corporate values drive who we are, which directly relates to the consistently high marks for ethics that we receive in our employee surveys. 
Employee survey input is routinely integrated into new and existing programs, policies and practices. Culture initiatives focused on increasing agility, collaboration, and engagement ("ACE"), ongoing since 2016, continue to evolve and benefit with direct input from employees. Through our ACE culture efforts, we promote diverse discussion and value ideas from all employees on how to work more effectively and more inclusively. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI"). ACE culture includes focus and commitment towards diversity, equity and inclusion. American National is committed to fostering a culture that welcomes diverse talents and perspectives and uses varied insights to make us better. We believe our company is strongest when each member of our team is respected, treated fairly and is comfortable to be who they are. We value the creativity and vitality an inclusive workforce creates and strive to embrace what makes each of us unique, including: race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, gender, religion, age, personal style and physical ability, as well as diverse opinions, perspectives, lifestyles and ideas.
•DEI Statement. In 2020, we released a diversity, equity and inclusion commitment statement and formed an executive-led ACE culture task force to build a strategy and roadmap of actions aimed at continuing to grow diversity, equity and inclusion within the company
•Inclusive Leadership Development. We believe inclusive leaders are necessary for building diverse teams, leveraging diverse perspectives to innovate and are critical to achieving organizational growth in the 21st century. Inclusive behavioral expectations are reflected in all manager goal forms and are considered when evaluating performance and compensation. Our leadership development program, Ascend, is designed to address and sharpen leaders’ skills we believe engage and retain employees. Leadership skills and behaviors are reviewed and calibrated in the annual succession planning process.
•Women's Leadership Forum. Our Women’s Leadership Forum was created in 2018 for female leaders to discuss important issues and share advice for working and advancing within American National. 
•Texas Competes. We are members of Texas Competes, a partnership of business leaders that is welcoming to people in the LGBTQIA+ community.
•Celebrating Diversity. Our annual calendar campaign recognizes, celebrates and educates that which makes us unique and includes commemorative months such as Black History Month, Women's History Month, Asian American Pacific Islander Month, LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Disability Employment Awareness Month and National American Indian Heritage Month.

•Recruitment and Retention. We have steadily increased our efforts in recent years to attract, retain, develop and promote qualified women and diverse candidates in our company. We use a variety of opportunities and programs to reach a broader range of applicants and talented individuals. Our talent acquisition team attends job fairs, provides internships and visits many colleges and universities, including certain historically black institutions, to find exceptional talent. We also participate in the U.S. Army Partnership for Youth Success to help honorably discharged soldiers find civilian careers. 
•Females constitute approximately 61% of our workforce. In the past five years, the percentage of women in officer positions grew from 25% to 34% with additional growth in all people-leader positions from 51% to 55%. Diversity in people-leader positions grew from 16% to 20% and diversity in officer positions grew from 6% to 10%.
Compensation and Benefits. We invest in our employees’ development and well-being and place a focus on providing a competitive total rewards package that includes the following:
•Base salaries that are consistent with position, skill level, experience and location. Base salaries are reviewed annually and have an opportunity to be increased based on performance. With the current competitive talent market, we routinely review critical positions against the market and adjust as necessary. 
•Employees are eligible for health benefits, health savings/flexible spending accounts, paid and unpaid leaves – including tenure-based paid time off and floating holidays - a 401(k) plan with a 4% company match, company-paid life insurance and disability/accident coverage, and dental and vision insurance
•Our employees’ personal well-being and professional development are critical to our long-term success. We provide all employees with the opportunity for paid volunteer time, a strong Employee Assistance Program to support individuals on a variety of topics impacting them, access to wellness coaching, health risk assessments, and onsite gyms. 
Development and Training. American National is committed to supporting the advancement of all employees through formal and informal learning opportunities, all of which are driven by our company goals, values and culture initiatives. All employees have opportunities to increase their insurance knowledge through certifications. The company partners with LOMA (Life Office Management Association) and The Institutes (Risk & Insurance Knowledge Group) to further employee education and professional development.
Employee Health and Welfare. During the COVID-19 pandemic, American National has devoted key resources to make employee health and safety a top priority. A majority of the workforce has transitioned to a hybrid work model that combines on-premise and remote work. This approach has reduced the daily volume of people on-site and has created a more flexible environment for employees. These efforts are having a positive impact as reflected in recent employee engagement survey results. As we proceed through the pandemic, we believe employee safety, productivity and retention are vital to meeting important business goals and objectives. Refer to Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion on management’s response to COVID-19.
Succession Planning. Succession planning is part of a larger talent management process which feeds organizational strategy to capitalize on the full potential of American National leaders. The talent management process touches on all key human resource areas of the employee life cycle and is aimed at retaining and growing high potential leaders, increasing performance and engagement, supporting internal mobility and future organizational structure.
