Item 1. Business

Standex International Corporation was incorporated in 1975 and is the successor of a corporation organized in 1955. As used in this report, the terms we, us, our, the Company and Standex mean Standex International Corporation and its subsidiaries. We have paid dividends each quarter since Standex became a public corporation in November 1964. 

Unless otherwise noted, references to years are to fiscal years.

We are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse commercial and industrial markets. We have 12 operating segments, aggregated and organized for reporting purposes into five segments: Food Service Equipment, Engraving, Engineering Technologies, Electronics and Hydraulics. Overall management, strategic development and financial control are maintained by the executive staff from our corporate headquarters located in Salem, New Hampshire. 

Our long-term strategy is to build larger industrial platforms through a value creation system that assists management in meeting specific corporate and business unit financial and strategic performance goals in order to create, improve, and enhance shareholder value. The Standex Value Creation System is a standard methodology which provides consistent tools used throughout the company in order to achieve our organizations goals. The Standex Value Creation System employs four components: Balanced Performance Plan, Standex Growth Disciplines, Standex Operational Excellence, and Standex Talent Management. The Balanced Performance Plan process aligns annual goals throughout the business and provides a standard reporting, management and review process. It is focused on setting and meeting annual and quarterly targets that support our short and long term goals. The Standex Growth Disciplines use a set of tools and processes including market maps, growth lane ways, and market tests to identify opportunities to expand the business organically and through acquisitions. Standex Operational Excellence employs a standard playbook and processes, including LEAN, to eliminate waste and improve profitability, cash flow and customer satisfaction. Finally, the Standex Talent Management process is an organizational development process that provides training, development, and succession planning for our employees throughout our worldwide organization. The Standex Value Creation System ties all disciplines in the organization together under a common umbrella by providing standard tools and processes to deliver our business objectives.

·
 It is our objective to grow larger and more profitable business units through both organic initiatives and acquisitions. We seek to identify and implement organic growth initiatives such as new product development, geographic expansion, introduction of products and technologies into new markets and applications, key accounts and strategic sales channel partners. Also, we have a long-term objective to create sizable business platforms by adding strategically aligned or bolt on acquisitions to strengthen the individual businesses, create both sales and cost synergies with our core business platforms, and accelerate their growth and margin improvement. We look to create both sales and cost synergies within our core business platforms, accelerate growth and improve margins. We have a particular focus on identifying and investing in opportunities that complement our products and will increase the global presence and capabilities of our businesses. From time to time, we have divested, and likely will continue to divest, businesses that we feel are not strategic or do not meet our growth and return expectations.

·
 We create Customer Intimacy by utilizing the Standex Growth Disciplines to partner with our customers in order to develop and deliver custom solutions or engineered components that solve problems for our customers or otherwise meet their needs. This relationship generally provides us with the ability to identify new sales opportunities with our customers, increase profit over time and provide operating margins that enhance shareholder returns. Further, we have made a priority of developing new sales channels and leveraging strategic customer relationships.

·
 Standex Operational Excellence drives continuous improvement in the efficiency of our businesses. We recognize that our businesses are competing in a global economy that requires us to improve our competitive position. We have deployed a number of management competencies to drive improvements in cost structure of our business units including operational excellence through lean enterprise, the use of low cost manufacturing facilities in countries such as Mexico and China, the consolidation of manufacturing facilities to achieve economies of scale and leveraging of fixed infrastructure costs, alternate sourcing to achieve procurement cost reductions, and capital improvements to increase productivity in both the shop floor and back-office.

·
 The Companys strong historical cash flow has been a cornerstone for funding our capital allocation strategy. We use cash flow generated from operations to fund the strategic growth programs described above, including acquisitions and investments for organic growth, maintenance of our capital assets and to return cash to our shareholders through payment of dividends and stock buybacks.

Our flexible design capability and global supply chain enable us to be successful in our expansion efforts. Our team is dedicated to superior customer service through our technical engineering support and on-time delivery. 

Raw Materials

Raw materials and components necessary for the manufacture of our products are generally available from numerous sources. Generally, we are not dependent on a single source of raw materials and supplies. We do not foresee unavailability of materials or supplies which would have a significant adverse effect on any of our businesses, nor any of our segments, in the near term.
Seasonality

We are a diversified business with generally low levels of seasonality; however, our fiscal third quarter is typically the period with the lowest level of sales volume.
Patents and Trademarks

We hold approximately 42 United States patents and patents pending covering processes, methods and devices and approximately 41 United States trademarks with six additional trademark applications filed. Many counterparts of these patents have also been registered in various foreign countries. In addition, we have various foreign registered and common law trademarks. 

Due to the diversity of our businesses and the markets served, the loss of any single patent or trademark would not, in our opinion, materially affect any individual segment. 

While we believe that many of our patents are important, we credit our competitive position in our niche markets to customer intimacy, engineering capabilities, manufacturing techniques and skills, marketing and sales promotions, service and the delivery of quality products. 

Customers

Our business is not dependent upon a single customer or a few large customers, the loss of any one of which would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. No customer accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2017 or any of the years presented. 
Working Capital

Our primary source of working capital is the cash generated from continuing operations. No segments require any special working capital needs outside of the normal course of business. 
Backlog

Backlog includes all active or open orders for goods and services that have a firm fixed customer purchase order with defined delivery dates. Backlog also includes any future deliveries based on executed customer contracts, so long as such deliveries are based on agreed upon delivery schedules. Backlog is not generally a significant factor in the Companys businesses because of our relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover with the exception of Engineering Technologies. Due to the nature of long term agreements in the Engineering Technologies segment, the timing of orders and delivery dates can vary considerably resulting in significant backlog changes from one period to another.

Backlog orders in place at June 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands): 


 | | As of June 30, 2017 | | | As of June 30, 2016
 | | Total Backlog | | Backlog under 1 year | | | Total Backlog | | Backlog under 1 year
Food Service Equipment | $ | 49,660 | $ | 47,039 | | $ | 37,202 | $ | 35,395 
Engraving | | 21,584 | | 21,584 | | | 19,046 | | 19,046 
Engineering Technologies | | 92,154 | | 61,329 | | | 90,241 | | 60,520 
Electronics | | 60,092 | | 56,741 | | | 44,713 | | 42,983 
Hydraulics | | 6,846 | | 6,846 | | | 4,951 | | 4,951 
Total | $ | 230,336 | $ | 193,539 | | $ | 196,153 | $ | 162,895 


Backlog realizable within one year increased $30.6 million, or 18.8%, to $193.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $162.9 million at June 30, 2016. Backlog realizable under a year increased for each of our segments with Food Service Equipment Electronics, and Hydraulics each increasing over 30% year over year. Food Service Equipment backlog realizable within one year increased $11.7 million, or 32.9%. Without the impact of the newly acquired Horizon business, Food Service Equipment backlog realizable within one year increased 28.9%. Higher demand for Refrigeration, Federal Industries, and Procon products drove the majority of the Food Service Equipment increase. Engraving backlog realizable within one year increased $2.5 million, or 13.3%. Adjusting for the impact of the divestiture of the roll plate engraving business, Engraving backlog realizable within one year increased 39.0%. The increase is a result of increased demand and the effect of some automotive projects that were delayed to fiscal year 2018. Electronics backlog realizable under a year increased $13.8 million, or 32.0%. Without the impact of the Standex Electronics Japan acquisition, Electronics backlog realizable within one year decreased 4.9%. 

Competition

Standex manufactures and markets products many of which have achieved a unique or leadership position in their market. However, we encounter competition in varying degrees in all product groups and for each product line. Competitors include domestic and foreign producers of the same and similar products. The principal methods of competition are product performance and technology, price, delivery schedule, quality of services, and other terms and conditions.
International Operations

We have international operations in all of our business segments. International operations are conducted at 58 locations, in Europe, Canada, China, India, Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for international operations financial data. Our net sales from international operations increased from 27% in 2016 to 31% in 2017. International operations are subject to certain inherent risks in connection with the conduct of business in foreign countries including, exchange controls, price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalizations, expropriation and other governmental action, restrictions of repatriation of earnings, and changes in currency exchange rates.
Research and Development

Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve our methods, processes, and equipment continues to drive our success. However, due to the nature of our manufacturing operations and the types of products manufactured, expenditures for research and development are not significant to any individual segment or in the aggregate. Research and development costs are quantified in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We develop and design new products to meet customer needs in order to offer enhanced products or to provide customized solutions for customers. 
Environmental Matters

Based on our knowledge and current known facts, we believe that we are presently in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance that will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
Financial Information about Geographic Areas

Information regarding revenues from external customers attributed to the United States, all foreign countries and any individual foreign country, if material, is contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for Industry Segment Information. 
Number of Employees

As of June 30, 2017, we employed approximately 5,500 employees of which approximately 2,900 were in the United States. About 350 of our U.S. employees were represented by unions. Approximately 26% of our production workforce is situated in low-cost manufacturing regions such as Mexico, Brazil and Asia.
