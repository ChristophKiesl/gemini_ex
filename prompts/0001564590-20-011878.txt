Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a leading provider of Business Spend Management (“BSM”) solutions. We offer a comprehensive, cloud-based BSM platform that has connected over one thousand organizations with more than five million suppliers globally. Our platform provides greater visibility into and control over how companies spend money. Using our platform, businesses are able to achieve real, measurable value and savings that drive their profitability.
 We offer a comprehensive cloud-based BSM platform designed for the modern global workforce that is mobile and expects real-time results, flexibility, and agility from software solutions. We empower employees to acquire the goods and services they need to do their jobs by applying a distinctive user-centric approach that provides a consumer Internet-like experience, drives widespread adoption of our platform, and significantly increases an organization’s spend under management. We refer to the process companies use to purchase goods and services as Business Spend Management and to the money that they manage with this process as spend under management. Increased user adoption and spend under management drive better visibility and control of a company’s spend, resulting in greater savings and increased compliance.
 Our BSM platform delivers a broad range of capabilities that would typically require the purchase and use of multiple disparate point applications. The core of our platform consists of procurement, invoicing, expense management, and payment modules that form the transactional engine for managing a company’s business spend. In addition, our platform offers supporting modules to help companies further manage their spend, including strategic sourcing, spend analysis, contract management, supplier management, and contingent workforce management. Our Community Intelligence capabilities apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to spend transactions happening across the growing Coupa community to identify and prescribe best practices that have helped customers to optimize spend, reduce risk, and improve efficiency. Additionally, we provide a purchasing program, Coupa Advantage, that leverages the collective buying power of Coupa customers to provide advantageous, pre-negotiated discounts from various suppliers.  We are further helping our Coupa community to collaborate with Source Together, functionality that connects Coupa community members with common purchasing needs to participate in group sourcing events and leverage their pooled buying power to capture greater savings at better terms. Moreover, through our Coupa Open Business Network, suppliers of all sizes can easily interact with buyers electronically, thus significantly reducing paper, improving operating efficiencies, and reducing costs.
 Our company culture and our interactions with customers are driven by three guiding principles (which we refer to as our core values): (1) ensuring customer success, (2) focusing on results; and (3) striving for excellence. In particular, this strong focus on customer success, which includes delivering quantifiable business value to our customers by helping them maximize their spend under management, serves as the foundation for the successful execution of our strategy, and, as a result, is critical to our growth. With a rapid time-to-deployment, typically ranging from a few weeks to several months, and an easy-to-use interface that shields users from unnecessary complexity, our customers can achieve widespread user adoption quickly and generate value within a short timeframe, thus benefiting from a rapid return on investment.
 We benefit from powerful network effects. As more businesses subscribe to our BSM platform, the collective spend under management on our platform grows. Greater aggregate spend under management on our platform attracts more suppliers, which in turn attracts more businesses that want to take advantage of the goods and services available through our platform. In addition, as more businesses and employees use our platform, the amount of spend under management continues to increase. This leads to increasingly more powerful prescriptive spend management and risk management recommendations from our Coupa Community Intelligence solutions, helping to create more value for customers and improving our ability to attract more businesses. The resulting increase in sales enables us to further invest in our platform and to improve our functionality and user interface to continue to attract more businesses and suppliers to our platform, which enhances the network effects that benefit all parties.

We have developed a rich partner ecosystem of systems integrators, implementation partners, resellers, and technology partners. We work closely with several global systems integrators, including Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, and others that help us scale our business, extend our global reach, and drive increased market penetration. We expect the number of partner-led implementations and sales referrals to continue to increase over time.
 We have achieved rapid growth in customer adoption, cumulative spend under management, and transactions conducted through our platform which is currently subscribed to by over 1,300 customers. Our cumulative spend under management is highlighted below:
 


As of January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our cumulative spend under management was $1,655 billion, $1,079 billion and $680 billion, respectively. Cumulative spend under management does not directly correlate to our revenue or results of operations because we do not generally charge our customers based on actual usage of our BSM platform. However, we believe that cumulative spend under management illustrates the adoption, scale, and value of our platform, which we believe enhances our ability to maintain existing customers and attract new customers.
 For our fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our revenues were $389.7 million, $260.4 million and $186.8 million, respectively, and our net losses were $90.8 million, $55.5 million and $43.8 million, respectively, as we focused on growing our business.

The Coupa BSM Platform 
 Our BSM platform provides businesses with real-time visibility and control of spending. The platform’s modern, user-centric interface enables businesses to drive adoption of the platform and capture, analyze, and control this spend, achieve real measurable value and savings, and directly improve their profitability: 

• | Drive Adoption. Our platform applies a distinctive user-centric approach that shields users from complexity and provides a mobile-enabled consumer Internet-like experience, thus enabling widespread adoption of our platform by users across the entire organization, and across the customer’s supplier base, as well. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capture. At the core of our platform is our transactional engine that is comprised of our procurement, invoicing, expense management, and payment management modules, which comprehensively help capture and manage spend within an organization. Given purchase orders, invoices, expense reports, and payments flow through our platform and the data is stored centrally in a clean and organized fashion, businesses are able to observe their spending activities in real-time. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analyze. Our spending analytics capabilities provide intuitive spend analysis dashboards and reports that deliver real-time analytical insights that help businesses identify problems and make better spending decisions. Real-time analytical and prescriptive insights are critical to helping identify savings opportunities and risks, isolating problem areas in the spending process, and providing recommendations to target improvement efforts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Control. We help our customers control and streamline their spending activity, realize efficiencies that result in real savings, and reduce supplier risk. Our platform has extensive functionality that enables managers to prevent excessive spend, reduce spend through efficiencies and cost savings associated with strategic sourcing and contract compliance, and identify and manage risky suppliers across numerous levels of the supply base. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Value. Within a short timeframe, we help our customers realize measurable value by taking advantage of pre-negotiated supplier discounts, achieving contract compliance, improving process efficiencies, and reducing redundant and wasteful spending, as well as enable strategic sourcing via reverse auctions in which suppliers bid down prices at which they are willing to sell their goods and services to businesses.

Our BSM Platform’s Capabilities 
 Our BSM platform includes the following capabilities:: 
 

Coupa’s Transactional Engine 
 The core of our platform is our transactional engine, which is comprised of the following modules:
  
• | Procure: Our procurement module enables customers to strategically establish spend policies and approval rules to govern company spending. The application provides a consumerized e-commerce shopping experience so that employees can easily and quickly find the goods and services they need to do their jobs. For example, employees searching for goods can see inventory-on-hand balances in the search results, which eliminates redundant spending. Our procurement module streamlines purchasing requisition and purchase order processes, allowing businesses to track and manage purchases in real-time, thus reducing time and cost. Upon approval of an employee request, purchase orders are automatically sent to suppliers for fulfillment and invoicing. Benchmark data allows customers to spot process inefficiencies, while configuration ease enables businesses to effortlessly adjust business processes to meet continually changing business requirements. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invoice: Our invoicing module enables customers to improve cash management through the effective management of supplier invoices via embedded dashboards and work queues that prioritize invoices with early payment discount opportunities. Customers may quickly configure invoice approval and matching rules so invoices can be routed without accounts payable team member effort and cost. Easy, no-cost means for suppliers to create electronic invoices that comply with government regulations allow businesses to eliminate paper and further reduce their invoice processing costs, all while reducing invoice payment fraud risk. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4

 
• | Expense: Our expense management module enables customers to gain control of the expenses incurred by employees. Innovative mobile capabilities such as GPS and geo-location make it easy for travelers to create expense reports on-the-go so that businesses gain real-time expense visibility. Frugal meter capabilities automatically assess the appropriateness of employee charges based on the customer’s configured business processes. Seamless connectivity to credit card providers feed charges into our expense management module for added visibility and reporting ease. Coupa provides additional travel management capabilities, such as travel price assurance that helps companies capture savings from flight and hotel price decreases that happen after the booking has been placed. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pay: Coupa Pay represents a set of solutions that help customers consolidate and optimize their processes to manage working capital and make payments to suppliers and contractors, as well as to employees for travel & expense reimbursements. With Coupa Pay, customers can make payments using different methods, called payment "rails", including domestic and international bank transfers, one-time-use "virtual" credit cards, digital checks, and digital wallets. Coupa's comprehensive approach intertwines early-payment discount programs with our customers’ procurement processes to increase supplier adoption and let customers increase returns on these programs. Customers get a single portal to manage all payments across multiple banks, and their suppliers get visibility into payment status. The process to create, approve, and release payments is automated to save time and avoid potential error and fraud. This process is secured with access controls and encrypted transmission and storage of payment-related information. With payments management as a core capability within a unified BSM platform, all types of payment transactions are automatically reconciled to backing documentation for better visibility and control of business spend.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supporting Modules 
 Our platform offers the following supporting modules that help companies further manage their spend:
 Strategic Sourcing. Our strategic sourcing module enables customers to find the best suppliers for the goods or services they need to run their businesses. It also offers advanced capabilities for the sourcing of complex sourcing categories such as direct raw materials and logistics. Customers easily create sourcing events containing the specifics of their business needs and invite suppliers to participate. Suppliers are able to review and bid effortlessly and without any fees to participate. Collaboration capabilities enable employees to review bids and provide feedback that is automatically compiled and scored. For the sourcing of complex categories, Coupa applies advanced mathematical optimization techniques, allowing customers to analyze price and non-price elements to find the combination of suppliers and goods and services that meet the constraints they specify.
 Contract Management.  Our contracts module enables customers to let their employees author new contracts within “guide rails” to manage risk while improving efficiency for their legal teams. Higher-risk contract terms can be escalated for legal review, while lower-risk choices can be pre-approved. Once negotiated, approved and signed, customers can operationalize contracts, making these contracts easily available for use by employees across the organization. Buying under the terms of contracts can increase savings through the use of negotiated rates and mitigate risk through contractual protections. Customers get visibility into how contracts affect spending with embedded dashboards at both the contract and summary level. Advanced contract analysis capabilities give customers visibility into contract terms and risk, while automatic alerts remind employees to review contracts prior to expiration or auto-renewal dates.
 Contingent Workforce. Our contingent workforce module enables customers to gain better visibility, control and optimization of services spend, as part of their holistic business spend management program. Customers can easily initiate requests for temporary work or advanced SOW-based projects as well as source and collect bids. Having better visibility to preferred suppliers helps customers optimize costs by selecting appropriate vendors with competitive rates. Onboarding and offboarding contingent workers is fast and secure, while tracking worker performance and ensuring compliance with company policies is simplified for both customers and contingent workers. 
 5

Supplier Management.  Our supplier management module enables customers to collect supplier information required to manage and pay suppliers and provides data about potential risks associated with a given supplier. Customers can also use this module to help ensure compliance and mitigate third-party risk by extensively evaluating their supplier base on critical risk domains, including information security, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and GDPR compliance, while also staying informed on potential supplier risk by leveraging credit ratings and other searches of publicly available databases.
 Spend Analysis.  Our spend analysis module provides managers a large set of built-in reports and dashboards that allow users to see spending activity, find bottlenecks in workflows, analyze granular data by commodity, supplier, location and cost center, and drill down into the spend transactions. Customers can also leverage our artificial intelligence capabilities to automate complex business spend data classification. We have created more than one hundred out-of-the-box reports covering some of the most important business metrics, such as unified spend for purchase orders, invoices or expense reports, spend trends over time, spend by commodity, supplier and contract. However, users can also create new metrics, reports and dashboards with our intuitive user interface, as well as include external data like corporate and travel expenses or integrate with third-party systems, to get a holistic view of their spend patterns.
Coupa Open Business Network
 Our Coupa Open Business Network instantly connects businesses and suppliers, providing businesses with a platform that is accessible to suppliers of all sizes—even those typically ignored by fee-based closed networks—to drive success. Suppliers have a variety of options to connect with businesses including:

• | Coupa Supplier Portal. This portal is a tool for suppliers to easily do business with our customers. The Supplier Portal lets suppliers manage content and settings on a customer-by-customer basis, including managing company information, setting up purchase order transmission preferences, creating and managing online catalogs, managing procurement orders and invoices across multiple customers and gaining visibility into the status of invoices. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Coupa Supplier Actionable Notifications. These notifications enable suppliers to receive HTML purchaser orders and convert these purchase orders into invoices right from the procurement order e-mail, which represents the easiest way to submit electronic invoices through our platform. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct Connection via cXML and EDI. Our platform supports various communication formats such as cXML or EDI for suppliers that want to automate their invoicing through a tighter integration with our platform. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct E-mail. Suppliers can choose to send PDF invoices simply through e-mail. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By using our Coupa Open Business Network, companies can become compliant with government mandates, increase profitability, and reduce costs by driving electronic transactions away from paper-based transactions. Our Coupa Open Business Network user interface is easy to navigate and requires little to no training for suppliers to instantly manage transactions. Businesses are able to interact with thousands of suppliers already using our Coupa Supplier Portal, quickly onboard new suppliers, integrate directly or simply use our smart e-mail tools. Businesses can also use the Coupa Open Business Network to layer on top of their existing technology, including third-party systems such as Oracle iProcurement, SAP SRM and others. Suppliers of all sizes benefit, as they are able to join the networked economy without changing their technology or spending money on transaction fees.
 Coupa Advantage
 Our Coupa Advantage program offers customers the opportunity to leverage pre-negotiated discounts from select suppliers in several business categories such as office supplies, branded promotional products, background checks, employee perquisites and more. The program leverages the collective buying power of Coupa customers to offer potential savings opportunities.

Coupa Community Intelligence
 Our Community Intelligence capability, which extends across our BSM platform, provides information to Coupa customers by applying artificial intelligence-powered analysis to the structured, normalized data collected from the comprehensive set of business spend transactions that have occurred on the Coupa platform. This innovative analysis provides Coupa customers with prescriptive recommendations to optimize their spend decisions, improve operational efficiency, and reduce risk based on best practices from the Coupa community. Participating customers are able to contribute to and benefit from Community Intelligence, with use cases spanning various areas of spend management, including Supplier Insights and Risk Aware which help companies evaluate and reduce the risk levels of suppliers, operational insights which helps businesses measure their own performance on key operational metrics against other Coupa customers and follow best practices to drive efficiency and savings, Commodity Insights and Procurable Spend Spotlight which help companies identify spend consolidation and savings opportunities, and Spend Guard, which surfaces potential errors and fraud across business spend, including invoices and employee expense reports.

Recent Acquisitions
 In May 2019, we completed the acquisition of Exari Group, Inc. for consideration of approximately $214.6 million in cash, or $208.3 million net of cash acquired. The acquisition extends our BSM platform with advanced contract lifecycle management capabilities to enable companies to comprehensively manage their contract lifecycle and operationalize their contracts against spend transactions.
 In December 2019, we completed the acquisition of Yapta, Inc., a leader in the travel price optimization market whose technology dynamically monitors airfare and hotel prices, identifies savings opportunities, and rebooks reservations when prices drop. We paid aggregate consideration of approximately $111.2 million in cash (which amount includes $9.8 million that is being held in escrow for 15 months after the transaction closing date and $12.5 million payable upon the achievement of Yapta’s revenue target during the twelve months starting from the transaction closing date). This technology will be an integral part of our travel and expense management portfolio. 
 
Partnerships and Strategic Relationships 
 As a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to extend our sales capabilities and coverage, to broaden and complement our application offerings, and to provide a broad array of services that lie outside of our primary areas of focus.
 Our partnerships increase our ability to grow and scale quickly and efficiently and allow us to maintain greater focus on executing against our strategy.
  
• | Referral Partners. Our referral partners provide global, national and regional expertise in business spend management, procurement and expense management. They help organizations through operational transformation by leveraging process, best practices and new technology. These partners may refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to them. In return, we typically pay these partners a percentage of the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implementation Partners. In order to offer the full breadth of implementation services, change management, and strategic consulting services to our customers, we work with leading global systems integrators such as Accenture, Deloitte and KPMG, as well as boutique and regional consulting firms. Our strategy is to enable the majority of our projects to be led by implementation partners with additional specialized support from us. Our implementation partners are highly skilled and trained by our team. When working with implementation partners, we are typically in a “co-sell” arrangement where we will sell our subscription directly to the customer and our partner will sell its implementation services directly to the customer. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology Infrastructure and Operations 
 The technologies used to build our platform and modules are native cloud and designed to scale to millions of users. We utilize a modern technology stack to take advantage of advancements in web design, open-source technologies, scalability and security. We have implemented industry-standard security practices to help us protect our customers’ critical information.
 We have partnered with leading hosting and infrastructure companies to provide the hardware and infrastructure to support our BSM platform. With these partnerships, we are able to easily scale the service during peak load periods, allowing us to continuously add users and customers without significant downtime or lead-time to procure new capacity. We also have the ability to offer our solutions globally across various different physical locations, such as the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific.
 Research and Development 
 Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development, and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our applications. We focus our efforts on developing new applications and core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing applications.
Competition 
 We believe the overall market for BSM software is highly competitive, marked by rapid consolidation, fragmented, and rapidly evolving due to technological innovations. We have been recognized, however, as a technology and market leader.
 Our competitors fall into the following categories:
  
• | Large enterprise software vendors such as Oracle Corporation, SAP AG and Workday that predominantly focus on database and ERP software solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Niche software vendors that either address only a portion of the capabilities we provide or predominantly focus on narrow industry verticals.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
  
• | focus on customer success;
--+---------------------------


• | ability to deliver measurable value and savings;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | ability to offer a comprehensive BSM platform;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | widespread adoption by users;
--+------------------------------


• | time to deployment;
--+--------------------


• | cloud-based architecture;
--+--------------------------

 10

 
• | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


• | configurability and agility;
--+-----------------------------


• | rich reporting capabilities;
--+-----------------------------


• | product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | independence;
--+--------------


• | adoption by suppliers;
--+-----------------------


• | ability to deliver prescriptive insights based on aggregated, anonymized data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to leverage extensive data to detect supplier and employee risk;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | and community-driven collaboration and savings opportunities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition and larger sales and marketing budgets; therefore, we may not compare favorably with respect to some or all of the factors above.
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. While we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one or more of our patents. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information.
 We pursue the registration of domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States. We also actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company.
 We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective protection of our technology and intellectual property rights may not be available to us in every country in which our software or services are available.
 We and others in our industry have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Moreover, many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents and/or have filed patent applications, and have asserted claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these companies, have asserted patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights within the industry. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
