Our Strategy and Business Segments
Our business is organized around three distinct sets of solutions -- Small and Medium Business Solutions (SMB), Enterprise Business Solutions and Digital Commerce Solutions (DCS). 
Small and Medium Business Solutions
We are a global leader in providing a full range of equipment, software, supplies and services that enable our clients to efficiently create physical and digital mail, evidence postage and print shipping labels for the sending of mail, flats and parcels. We segment the SMB Solutions group between our North America operations, comprising the U.S. and Canadian businesses, and our International operations, comprising all other SMB businesses globally. We are a leading provider of mailing systems globally with about 1.2 million meters installed worldwide. We are also continuing to expand our business to include online offerings without a hardware component. This business is characterized by a high level of recurring revenue driven by rental, lease and loan arrangements, contract support services and supplies sales. 
Enterprise Business Solutions
Our Enterprise Business Solutions group includes equipment and services that enable large enterprises to process inbound and outbound mail. The Enterprise Business Solutions group includes our Production Mail operations and Presort Services operations. 
Production Mail
Our product and service offerings enable clients to integrate all areas of print and mail into an end-to-end production environment from message creation to dispatch while realizing cost savings on postage. The core products within this segment include high-speed, high-volume inserting equipment, customized sortation products for mail and parcels and high-speed digital color printing systems that create high-value, relevant and timely communications targeted to our clients' customers. In 2017, we expect to expand our cloud connectivity solutions currently available for our inserter equipment into our print and sortation machines. 
Presort Services
We are a national outsource provider of mail presort services for First-Class, Standard, flat and parcels in the U.S. and a workshare partner of the United States Postal Service (USPS). Our Presort Services network and fully-customized proprietary technology provides our clients with end-to-end solutions from pick up at their location to delivery into the postal system network. We process approximately 15 billion pieces of mail annually through our network of operating centers throughout the Unites States and are able to expedite mail delivery and optimize postage savings for our clients. In 2016, we began offering sortation services for parcel mail and expect to expand this offering in 2017. 
Digital Commerce Solutions
Within the Digital Commerce Solutions group, we provide a broad range of solutions, including customer information management, location intelligence, customer engagement software and shipping management and cross border ecommerce solutions for businesses of all sizes. These solutions are delivered as traditional software licenses, enterprise platforms, software-as-a-service (SaaS) or on-demand applications. Our Digital Commerce Solutions group includes Software Solutions and Global Ecommerce. 
Software Solutions
Customer information management solutions help businesses harness and develop a deep and broad understanding of their customers and their context, such as location, relationships, propensity, sentiment and influence. The trusted data and associated insights allow our clients to deliver a personalized customer experience across multiple channels, manage risk and compliance, and improve sales, marketing and service effectiveness. We are one of the market leaders in the data quality segment. Large corporations and government agencies rely on our products in complex, high-volume, transactional environments to support their business processes.
Location intelligence solutions enable our clients to organize and understand the complex relationships between location, geographic and other forms of data to drive business decisions and customer experiences. Our location intelligence solutions use predictive analytics, location, geographic and socio-demographic characteristics, which enable our clients to harness the power of location to better serve their customers, solve business problems, deliver location-based services and ultimately drive business growth.

Customer engagement solutions provide clients with insight and understanding into customer behavior and interactions across the entire customer lifecycle, enabling them to orchestrate impactful, relevant and timely physical and digital interactions. When coupled with our inserting, sortation and digital print products, we are able to provide clients an all-inclusive solution that enables them to create, print and distribute wide-spread targeted customer communications. Our customer engagement solutions enable our clients to create connected experiences that positively influence future consumer behavior and generate business growth. 
Global Ecommerce 
Global Ecommerce includes our cross-border ecommerce solutions and retail and warehouse shipping management solutions. Global Ecommerce provides a full suite of domestic and cross-border solutions that help businesses of all sizes conduct commerce and participate in the parcel journey from “Anywhere to Everywhere™.” It is our technology, services and industry expertise that have made us an industry leader in global commerce. We offer a unified commerce platform of capabilities for cross-border, marketplaces and shipping that center around the consumer. With our proprietary technology, we are able to manage all aspects of the international shopping and shipping experience, including multi-currency pricing, payment processing, fraud management, calculation of fully landed costs by quoting duty, taxes and shipping at checkout, compliance with product restrictions, export complexities and documentation requirements for customs clearance and brokerage and global logistics services. Our cross-border ecommerce software platforms are currently utilized by direct merchants as well as a major online marketplace enabling millions of parcels to be shipped to countries and territories worldwide. Our platform also connects retailers to marketplaces around the world, opening new markets and expanding existing markets for their goods.
Our shipping management solutions enable clients to reduce transportation and logistics costs, to select the best carrier based on need and cost, to improve delivery times and to track packages in real-time. Our Shipping API technology, an integral part of the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud, provides easy access to shipping and tracking services that can be easily integrated into any web application such as online shopping carts or ecommerce sites. We also offer scalable shipping solutions that can be integrated into mail centers for the office market.
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment and geographic information. 
Client Service
We have a client care service organization that provides telephone, online and on-site support to diagnose and repair our increasingly complex mailing equipment, production printers and sophisticated software solutions. Most of our support services are provided under annual contracts.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products and services through a direct and inside sales force, direct mailings, telemarketing, independent dealers and distributors and web channels. We sell to a variety of business, governmental, institutional and other organizations, and in our Ecommerce business only, we also sell to consumers. We have a broad base of clients and are not dependent upon any one client or type of client for a significant part of our total revenue. 

We have made, and are continuing to make significant investments in the rebranding of the company. These investments include marketing and advertising designed to build market awareness and client demand for our products and services, and enhance our operational and go-to-market changes, including how we sell to and service clients.
Competition
All of our businesses face competition from a number of companies. Our competitors range from large, multinational companies that compete against many of our businesses to smaller, more narrowly focused regional and local firms. We compete on the basis of technology and innovation; breadth of product offerings; our ability to design and tailor solutions to specific client needs; performance; client service and support; price; quality and brand.
We must continue to invest in our current technologies, products and solutions, and in the development of new technologies, products and solutions in order to maintain and improve our competitive position. We will encounter new competitors as we transition to higher value markets and offerings and enter new markets.

A summary of the competitive environment for each of our business segments is as follows:
North America Mailing and International Mailing
We face significant competition from other mail equipment and software companies, companies that offer products and services as alternative means of message communications and non-traditional competitors that offer shipping and mailing products and services through online solutions. The principal competitive factors include the composition of offerings between software and hardware solutions, pricing, available financing and payment offerings, product reliability, support services, industry knowledge and expertise and attractiveness of alternative communication methods. Our competitive advantage includes our breadth of physical and web-based digital offerings, customer service and our extensive knowledge of the shipping and mailing industry. 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, The Pitney Bowes Bank (the Bank), we offer a revolving credit solution to our clients in the United States that enables them to pay for postage, the rental of certain mailing equipment and purchase products, supplies and services. The Bank also provides an interest-bearing deposit solution to those clients in the United States who prefer to prepay postage. We also provide similar revolving credit solutions to our clients in Canada and the U.K. but do not offer these through the Bank. Our financing operations face competition, in varying degrees, from large, diversified financial institutions, including leasing companies, commercial finance companies and commercial banks, as well as small, specialized firms. Not all our competitors are able to offer these financing and payment solutions to their customers and we believe these solutions differentiate us from our competitors and are a source of competitive advantage. The Bank is chartered as an Industrial Bank under the laws of the State of Utah, and regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions.
Production Mail
We face competition from other companies that offer large production printers, inserters or sorters. We also face competition from the fact that some companies choose to outsource although those outsource providers can also be our customers. Our primary competitive advantage lies in our ability to offer all of these products and services and integrate them into an end-to-end solution. The principal competitive factors include functionality, reliability, productivity, price and support. 
Presort Services
We face competition from regional and local presort providers and service bureaus that offer presort solutions as part of a larger bundle of outsourcing services, and large entities that have the capability to presort their own mailings in-house. The principal competitive factors include innovative service, delivery speed, industry expertise and economies of scale. Our competitive advantage includes our extensive network of presort facilities capable of processing significant volumes of mail and our innovative and proprietary technology that enables us to provide our clients with reliable and accurate services at maximum discounts. 
Software Solutions 
We operate in several highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets and face competition ranging from large global companies that offer a broad suite of solutions to smaller, more narrowly-focused companies that can design very targeted solutions. The principal competitive factors include reliability, functionality, ease of integration and use, scalability, innovation, support services and price. We compete based on the accuracy and processing speed of our solutions, particularly those used in our location intelligence solutions, the breadth and scalability of our products and solutions, our geocoding and reverse geocoding capabilities, and our ability to identify rapidly changing customer needs and develop technologies and solutions to meet these changing needs. 
Global Ecommerce
The market for international ecommerce software and fulfillment services is highly fragmented and includes competitors of various sizes, including companies with greater financial resources than us. Some of these competitors specialize in point solutions or freight forwarding services, are full-service ecommerce business process outsourcers and online marketplaces with international logistic support, or major global delivery services companies. The principal competitive factors include reliability, functionality, ease of integration and use, scalability of our platform and our logistics services, innovation, support services and price. We compete based on the accuracy, reliability and scalability of our platform, and our ability to provide our clients and their customers a one-stop full-service cross border ecommerce experience. In our shipping solutions business, we compete with a wide range of technology providers who help make shipping easier and more cost-effective for the retailer, warehouse, or office shipper. There are established players in the marketplace who are set-up to compete against their client base. The remainder of the shipping market is very fragmented with many small companies offering negotiated carrier rates (primarily with the USPS).  The principal competitive factors include technology stability and reliability, innovation, access to preferred shipping rates, and ease of integration with existing systems.

Financing Solutions
We offer a variety of finance and payment solutions to clients to finance their equipment and product purchases, rental and lease payments, postage replenishment and supplies purchases. As our other product and service offerings evolve, we continually evaluate whether there are appropriate financing solutions for us to offer our clients. We establish credit approval limits and procedures based on the credit quality of the client and the type of product or service provided to control risk in extending credit to clients. In addition, we utilize a systematic decision program for certain leases. This program is designed to facilitate low dollar transactions by utilizing historical payment patterns and losses realized for clients with common credit characteristics. The program defines the criteria under which we will accept a client without performing a more detailed credit investigation, such as maximum equipment cost, a client's time in business and payment experience. 
We closely monitor the portfolio by analyzing industry sectors and delinquency trends by product line, industry and client to ensure reserve levels and credit policies reflect current trends. Management continues to closely monitor credit lines and collection resources and revise credit policies as necessary to be more selective in managing the portfolio.
Research, Development and Intellectual Property
We invest in research and development programs to develop new products and solutions, enhance the effectiveness and functionality of existing products and solutions and deliver high value technology, innovative software and differentiated services in high value segments of the market. As a result of our research and development efforts, we have been awarded a number of patents with respect to several of our existing and planned products. The continued evolution of patent law and the nature of our innovation work may affect the number of patents we are able to receive for our internal development efforts. However, our businesses are not materially dependent on any one patent or license or group of related patents or licenses. Research and development expenditures were $121 million in 2016 and $110 million, in both 2015 and 2014. 
Material Suppliers
We depend on third-party suppliers for a variety of services, components, supplies and a large portion of our product manufacturing. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers around the world because the relationship is advantageous due to quality, price, or there are no alternative sources. We have not historically experienced shortages in services, components or products and believe that our available sources for materials, components, services and supplies are adequate.
Regulatory Matters 
We are subject to the regulations of postal authorities worldwide related to product specifications and business practices involving our postage meters. We are further subject to the regulations of the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC with respect to the operations of the Bank and certain company affiliates that provide services to the Bank. We are also subject to the regulations of transportation, customs and other trade authorities worldwide related to the cross-border shipment of equipment, materials and parcels. In addition, we are subject to regulations worldwide concerning data privacy and security for our businesses that use, process and store certain personal, confidential or proprietary data. 
Employees and Employee Relations 
At December 31, 2016, we have approximately 14,200 employees worldwide. We believe that we maintain strong relationships with our employees. Management keeps employees informed of decisions and encourages and implements employee suggestions whenever practicable.
