Overview
We formed our company in 2012 to acquire and actively manage a portfolio of mineral and royalty interests in the core of what we view as the most active, highly economic, liquids-rich resource basins across the continental United States. Our primary business objective is to maximize risk-adjusted total return to our shareholders by both capturing growth in free cash flow from the continued development of our existing portfolio of 12,777 undeveloped horizontal drilling locations, inclusive of 715 gross permits and in addition to 892 gross DUCs, unburdened by development capital expenditures or lease operating expenses, as well as leveraging our highly experienced technical evaluation team to continue to execute upon our scalable business model of sourcing, methodically evaluating and integrating accretive minerals acquisitions in the core of top-tier, liquids-rich resource plays. 
Our portfolio is comprised of mineral and royalty interests across four of the most highly economic, liquids-rich resource basins in the continental United States, including the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the SCOOP and STACK plays in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the Denver-Julesburg (“DJ”) Basin in Colorado and Wyoming and the Williston Basin in North Dakota. Our highly technical approach towards mineral acquisitions in the geologic core of top-tier resource plays has purposefully led to a concentrated portfolio covering 39 of the most highly active counties for horizontal drilling in the continental United States. 
Since inception, we have executed on our technically driven, disciplined acquisition approach and have closed 1,551 transactions with third-party mineral and royalty interest owners as of December 31, 2019. We have increased our mineral and royalty interests from approximately 10,200 net royalty acres as of December 31, 2013, to approximately 82,200 net royalty acres as of December 31, 2019, which represents a 54% compound annual growth rate in our mineral and royalty interests over that period. See “—Overview—Our Mineral and Royalty Interests” for a discussion of how we calculate net royalty acres. 
The following table summarizes certain information regarding our net royalty acreage acquisitions during each year of our operations. 

 | 2012 | 2013 | | 2014 | 2015 | | 2016 | | 2017 | 2018 | | 2019 | | Total

By targeting core, top-tier mineral acreage, our interests have continued to see rapid development with a total of approximately 1,104 gross horizontal wells spud on our mineral and royalty interests during the full year of 2019. This significant activity has similarly translated into rapid production growth with our production volumes growing approximately 91% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Further, our production volumes are comprised of high-value liquids with 71% of our volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 composed of 
 8

crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), which represents 90% of our mineral and royalty revenue for the period. The combined growth in our production volumes and the high percentage of liquids production have resulted in a 64% increase in our royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect to see near term organic growth in our production, revenue and free cash flow from 892 drilled but uncompleted horizontal wells (“DUCs”) across our interests and approximately 715 horizontal drilling permits as of December 31, 2019, all of which are expected to occur without additional capital expenditure outlays. Development of permits on our acreage is driven by robust and consistent rig activity on meaningful portions of our acreage. During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were an average of 65 horizontal rigs across our acreage, drilling approximately 2,700 net royalty acres. Likewise, over the three months ended December 31, 2019, there were 60 horizontal rigs across our acreage, drilling approximately 2,500 net royalty acres. 
Average Quarterly Rigs on Acreage             
In addition to existing near-term development, our permitted horizontal drilling locations represent only approximately 6% of our horizontal drilling locations, thereby providing us with a substantial long-term drilling inventory on our acreage. 
As indicated by the following table, from 2018 to 2019, the gross number of wells spud and wells turned to production on our acreage increased by 5% and 9%, respectively, as our average realized prices for oil, gas and NGLs decreased by 11%, 26% and 42%, respectively. Based solely on the 1,104 horizontal wells spud on our acreage during 2019 and our 12,777 total gross undeveloped horizontal drilling locations as of December 31, 2019, we believe we have 12 years of organic drilling inventory. 

 | 2018 | 2019 
 | On Our Acreage | Total Across Basins | | Our Share of Total | On Our Acreage | | Total Across Basins | | Our Share of Total
Wells spud | 1,049 | | 4,885 | | 21 | % | | 1,104 | | 8,599 | 13 | %
Wells turned to production | 1,036 | | 9,634 | | 11 | % | | 1,127 | | 6,446 | 17 | %

Our Mineral and Royalty Interests 
Mineral interests are real-property interests that are typically perpetual and grant both ownership of the oil, natural gas and NGLs under a tract of land and the ability to lease development rights to a third party. When those rights are leased, usually for a three-year primary term, we typically receive an upfront cash payment, known as lease bonus, and we retain a mineral royalty, which entitles us to a percentage of production or revenue. In addition to mineral interests, which represented approximately 95% of our net royalty acres as of December 31, 2019, we also own other types of interests, including nonparticipating royalty interests (“NPRIs”) and overriding royalty interests (“ORRIs”). ORRIs are a contractual arrangement burdening the working interest ownership of a lease and represent the right to receive a fixed percentage of production or revenue from production from a lease. ORRIs remain in effect until the associated lease expires and are therefore not perpetual in nature.
As a mineral and royalty interest owner, we incur the initial cost to acquire our interests, but thereafter do not incur any development capital expenditures or lease operating expenses, which are entirely borne by the operator. Mineral and royalty owners only incur their proportionate share of severance and ad valorem taxes, as well as in some instances, gathering, transportation and marketing costs. As a result, operating margins and therefore free cash flow for a mineral and royalty interest owner are higher as a percentage of revenue than for a traditional exploration and production operating company.

As of December 31, 2019, our mineral and royalty interests consisted of approximately 57,800 net mineral acres, which have been leased to operators to explore for and develop our oil and natural gas rights at a weighted average royalty of 17.8%. Typically, within the minerals industry, mineral owners standardize ownership to a 12.5%, or 1/8th, royalty interest, which is referred to as a “net royalty acre.” Our net mineral acres standardized to a 1/8th royalty equate to approximately 82,200 net royalty acres. When standardized on a 100% royalty basis, these approximately 82,200 net royalty acres equate to approximately 10,250 “100% royalty acres.” Our approximately 82,200 net royalty acres are located within 1,584 drilling spacing units (“DSUs”), which are the areas designated in a spacing order or unit designation as a drilling unit and within which operators drill wellbores to develop our oil and natural gas rights. Our DSUs, in aggregate, consist of a total of approximately 1,573,950 gross acres, which we refer to as our “gross DSU acreage.” Within our gross DSU acreage, we expect to have an interest in wells currently producing or that will be drilled in the future. The following table summarizes our mineral and royalty interest position and the conversion of our interests between net mineral acres, net royalty acres and 100% royalty acres as of December 31, 2019. 

Net Mineral Acres | Weighted Average Royalty | | Net Royalty Acres(1) | 100% Royalty Acres(2) | Gross DSU Acres | | Implied Average Net Revenue Interest per Well(3)

Our Properties
Focus Areas
Our mineral and royalty interests are primarily located in six resource plays, which we refer to as our focus areas. These include the Delaware and Midland Basins in the Permian Basin, the SCOOP and STACK plays in the Anadarko Basin, the DJ Basin and the Williston Basin. The following chart shows our overall exposure to each of our primary focus areas based on our net royalty acres in each focus area as of December 31, 2019.
In addition, the following table summarizes certain information regarding our primary focus areas. Our average daily net production for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was comprised 56% of oil production, 29% of natural gas production and 15% of NGL production.

Permian Basin-Delaware and Midland Basins 
The Permian Basin ranges from West Texas into southeastern New Mexico and is currently the most active area for horizontal drilling in the United States. The Permian Basin is further subdivided into the Delaware Basin in the west and the Midland Basin in the east. Based on our geologic and engineering data as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the Delaware Basin are prospective for seven or more producing zones of economic horizontal development including the Wolfcamp A, B, C and XY; First, Second and Third Bone Spring; and the Avalon. Our Delaware Basin mineral and royalty interests are located in Reeves, Loving, Ward, Pecos, Culberson and Winkler Counties, Texas with our remaining interests located in Lea County, and Eddy County, New Mexico. Based on our geologic and engineering interpretations as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the Midland Basin are prospective for five or more producing zones of economic horizontal development including the Middle Spraberry; Lower Spraberry; and Wolfcamp A, B, C, and "D" / Cline. Our Midland Basin mineral and royalty interests are located in Martin, Midland, Upton, Howard, Glasscock and Reagan Counties, Texas. 
Anadarko Basin-SCOOP and STACK Plays 
The SCOOP play (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) is located in central Oklahoma in Grady, Garvin, Stephens and McClain Counties. Based on our geologic and engineering interpretations as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the SCOOP play are prospective for two or more producing zones of economic horizontal development including multiple Woodford benches and the Springer Shale. In addition, operators are also currently testing other formations in the area including the Sycamore, Caney and Osage, which is also referred to as SCORE (Sycamore Caney Osage Resource Expansion). The STACK play (derived from Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties) is located in central Oklahoma in Kingfisher, Canadian, Caddo and Blaine Counties. Based on our geologic and engineering data as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the STACK play are prospective for four or more producing zones of economic horizontal development including multiple benches within both the Meramec and Woodford formations. 
DJ Basin 
The DJ Basin is located in Northeast Colorado and Southeast Wyoming, with the majority of operator horizontal drilling activity located in Weld and Broomfield Counties, Colorado, and Laramie County, Wyoming. Based on our geologic and engineering interpretations as well as current delineation efforts by operators, we believe our mineral and royalty interests in the DJ Basin are prospective for four or more producing zones of economic horizontal development including the Niobrara A, B and C and Codell formations. 
Williston Basin 
The Williston Basin stretches from western North Dakota into eastern Montana with the majority of operator horizontal drilling activity located in Mountrail, Williams, and McKenzie Counties, North Dakota. Based on our geologic and engineering 
 11

interpretations as well as current operator delineation efforts, we believe our mineral and royalty interests are prospective for two or more producing zones of economic horizontal development including the Bakken and multiple Three Forks benches. The majority of our interests are located in Mountrail, Williams and McKenzie Counties with additional interests owned in Divide, Burke, Dunn, Billings and Stark Counties, North Dakota and Richland County, Montana. 
Other Counties 
Our other interests are comprised of mineral and royalty interests owned in Carter and Love Counties, Oklahoma in what we refer to as the Extended Woodford play in the Marietta and Ardmore Basins and in Bradford, Sullivan and Washington Counties, Pennsylvania in the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. We also own acreage in the Merge trend in Oklahoma, centered in northern Grady County and southern Canadian Counties. Our interests in Carter and Love Counties are largely being developed by Exxon Mobil Corporation through their operating subsidiary XTO Energy. Our interests in Pennsylvania are largely being developed by Range Resources Corporation and Chief Oil & Gas LLC. 
Prospective Undeveloped Horizontal Drilling Locations 
We believe our production and free cash flow will grow through the drilling of the substantial undeveloped organic inventory of horizontal drilling locations located on our acreage. As of December 31, 2019, we have identified 12,777 gross drilling locations across our gross DSU acreage as identified in our December 31, 2019 reserve report audited by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. ("CG&A"), our independent petroleum engineering firm. Furthermore, we believe additional optionality is possible through the delineation of additional formations as well as incremental wells in existing formations. Approximately 51% of our total net horizontal undeveloped locations are located in the Delaware and Midland Basins, with another 22% located in the SCOOP and STACK plays of the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, as shown in the following table. 

 | Gross Horizontal Undeveloped Locations | Percentage of Total Portfolio | | Net Horizontal Undeveloped Locations | Percentage of Total Portfolio

Third-Party Operators
Beyond our technical analysis to identify core, highly economic areas, an additional critical aspect of our evaluation process is to acquire mineral and royalty interests that will be drilled and completed by operators we believe will outperform their peers through the application of the latest drilling and completion technologies in each of our operating basins. The following chart summarizes our exposure to these operators based on the percentage of our net interests in the wells to be drilled by each operator. Net interests per gross location are normalized to 7,500 ft. laterals.

Business Objectives
Our primary business objective is to deliver an attractive risk-adjusted total return to our shareholders through (i) the growth of our free cash flow generated from our existing portfolio of approximately 82,200 net royalty acres, and (ii) the continued sourcing and execution of accretive mineral acquisitions in the core of highly economic, liquids-rich resource plays. 
Our Corporate Structure 
Brigham Minerals, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in June 2018 for the purpose of completing the IPO and related transactions. On April 23, 2019, in connection with the IPO, Brigham Minerals became a holding company whose sole material asset consists of units in Brigham LLC (the “Brigham LLC Units”). Brigham LLC wholly owns Brigham Resources, which wholly owns the Minerals Subsidiaries, which own all of our operating assets. The remainder of the Brigham LLC Units are held by affiliates of Warburg Pincus LLC (“Warburg Pincus”), Yorktown Partners LLC (“Yorktown”), Pine Brook Road Advisors, LP (“Pine Brook”) and certain of our management members and other prior investors (together with Warburg Pincus, Yorktown and Pine Brook, the “Original Owners”). 
As the sole managing member of Brigham LLC, Brigham Minerals operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Brigham LLC, and through Brigham LLC and its subsidiaries, conducts its business. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Brigham LLC and its subsidiaries and report temporary equity related to the portion of Brigham LLC Units not owned by us, which will reduce net income (loss) attributable to the holders of our Class A common stock. As of February 27, 2020, Brigham Minerals owned 60.1% of Brigham LLC. 
Each of the Original Owners holds one share of our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B common stock"), for each Brigham LLC Unit such person holds. Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by shareholders generally. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. We do not intend to list Class B common stock on any exchange. 
Under the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Brigham LLC (the “Brigham LLC Agreement”), each holder of a Brigham LLC Unit (a “Brigham Unit Holder”) has, subject to certain limitations, the right (the “Redemption Right”) to cause Brigham LLC to acquire all or a portion of its Brigham LLC Units for, at Brigham LLC’s election, (i) shares of our Class A common stock at a redemption ratio of one share of Class A common stock for each Brigham LLC Unit redeemed, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions or (ii) an equivalent amount of cash. Our decision to make a cash payment upon a Brigham Unit Holder’s redemption election must be made by our independent directors (within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange and Section 10A-3 of the Securities Act) who do not own LLC units that are subject to such redemption. We will determine whether to issue shares of Class A common stock or cash based on facts in existence at the time of the decision, which we expect would include the relative value of the Class A common stock (including trading prices for the Class A common stock at the time), the cash purchase price, the availability of other sources of liquidity (such as an issuance of preferred stock) to acquire the Brigham LLC Units and alternative uses for such cash. Alternatively, upon the exercise of the Redemption Right, Brigham Minerals (instead of Brigham LLC) will have the right (the “Call Right”) to, for administrative convenience, acquire each tendered Brigham LLC Unit directly from the redeeming Brigham Unit Holder for, at its election, (x) one share of Class A common stock or (y) an equivalent amount of cash. In connection with any redemption of Brigham LLC Units pursuant to the Redemption Right or acquisition pursuant to our Call Right, the corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled. Under the Registration Rights Agreement we entered into with certain of the Original Owners in connection with the IPO, such Original Owners have the right, under certain circumstances, to cause us to register the offer and resale of their shares of Class A common stock. 

The following diagram indicates our simplified ownership structure as of February 27, 2020. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not represent all legal entities affiliated with us.

Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves
Evaluation and Audit of Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves. Our proved, probable and possible reserve estimates as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018 were audited by CG&A, our independent petroleum engineers, and our proved, probable and possible reserve estimates as of December 31, 2017 were prepared by CG&A. Within CG&A, the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the reserve estimates set forth in the reserve reports incorporated herein is Todd Brooker. Prior to joining CG&A, Mr. Brooker worked in Gulf of Mexico drilling and production engineering at Chevron USA. Mr. Brooker has been an employee of CG&A since 1992. His responsibilities include reserve and economic evaluations, fair market valuations, field studies, pipeline resource studies and acquisition/divestiture analysis. His reserve reports are routinely used for public company SEC disclosures. His experience includes significant projects in both conventional and unconventional resources in every major U.S. producing basin and abroad, including oil and gas shale plays, coalbed methane fields, waterfloods and complex, faulted structures. Mr. Brooker graduated with honors from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE). 
Mr. Brooker meets or exceeds the requirements with regard to qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. CG&A does not own an interest in any of our properties, nor is it employed by us on a contingent basis. Summaries of CG&A’s report with respect to our proved, probable and possible reserve estimates as of December 31, 2019 is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report. 
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved, probable and possible reserves relating to our properties. Our internal technical team members meet with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the proved, probable and possible reserve report to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved, probable and possible reserve estimation process. We provide historical information to CG&A for our properties, such as ownership interest, oil and natural gas production, well test data, commodity prices and our estimates of our operators’ operating and development costs. Hal Hogsett is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. Mr. Hogsett has substantial reservoir and operations experience having worked as a petroleum engineer since 2009 and is supported by our engineering and geoscience staff. Prior to joining our Company in 2017, Mr. Hogsett worked at Apache Corporation and Antero Resources Corporation.
The preparation of our proved, probable and possible reserve estimates were completed in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following:

• | review and verification of historical production data, which data is based on actual production as reported by our operators; 


• | review by Hal Hogsett, our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering, of all of our reported proved, probable and possible reserves, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new PUDs additions;


• | verification of property ownership by our land department;


• | review of reserve estimates by Mr. Hogsett or under his direct supervision; and


• | direct reporting responsibilities by Mr. Hogsett to our Chief Executive Officer.

Estimation of Proved Reserves. In accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” means deterministically, the quantities of oil and/or natural gas are much more likely to be achieved than not, and probabilistically, there should be at least a 90% probability of recovering volumes equal to or exceeding the estimate. All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were estimated using a deterministic method. The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into four broad categories or methods: (i) production performance-based methods; (ii) material balance-based methods; (iii) volumetric-based methods; and (iv) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance methods for the vast majority of properties. Certain new producing properties with very little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to similar production, both of which are considered to provide a reasonably high degree of accuracy. Non-producing reserve estimates, for developed and undeveloped properties, were forecast using analogy methods. This method provides a reasonably high degree of accuracy for predicting proved developed non-producing and PUDs for our properties, due to the abundance of analog data. 
To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, we considered many factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological and engineering data that cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates.
Under SEC rules, reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability, and include production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core data, and historical well cost and operating expense data.
Estimation of Probable Reserves. Estimates of probable reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of probable reserves is an estimate of those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Estimates of probable reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. 
When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. All of our probable reserves as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were estimated using a deterministic method, which involves two distinct determinations: an estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and an estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves uses the same generally accepted analytical procedures as are used in estimating proved reserves, namely production performance-based methods, material balance-based methods, volumetric-based methods and analogy. In the case of probable reserves, the recoverable reserves cannot be said to have a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” but are “as likely as not to be recovered.” The lower degree of certainty can come from several factors including: (1) direct offset production that does not meet an economic threshold, despite localized averages that do meet that threshold, (2) an increased distance from offset production to the probable location of over one mile but under three miles, (3) a perceived risk of communication or depletion from nearby producers, (4) a perceived risk of attempting new drilling or completion technologies that have not been used in direct offset production or (5) an uncertainty regarding geologic positioning that could affect recoverable reserves. When considering the factors referenced above, the lower degree of certainty of our probable reserves came from a combination of these factors depending upon the applicable basin. Many of the probable locations assigned in our reserve reports had few uncertainties and resemble proved undeveloped locations except for their distance from commercial production. Other probable locations had uncertainties related to not only 
 18

distance from commercial production, but also related to well spacing and development timing. In general, we did not book probable locations if there was geologic uncertainty or if there was not commercial production to support such locations.
Estimation of Possible Reserves. Estimates of possible reserves are also inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, an estimated quantity of possible reserves is an estimate that might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely. Estimates of possible reserves are also continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors.
When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. All of our possible reserves as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were estimated using a deterministic method, which involves two distinct determinations: an estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and an estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves uses the same generally accepted analytical procedures as are used in estimating proved reserves, namely production performance-based methods, material balance-based methods, volumetric-based methods and analogy. In the case of possible reserves, the recoverable reserves cannot be said to be “as likely as not to be recovered”, but “might be achieved, but only under more favorable circumstances than are likely.” The lower degree of certainty can come from several factors including: (1) direct offset production that does not meet an economic threshold, despite localized averages that do meet that threshold, (2) an increased distance from offset production to the possible location of over one mile but under five miles, (3) a perceived risk of communication or depletion from nearby producers, (4) a perceived risk of attempting new drilling or completion technologies that have not been used in direct offset production or (5) an uncertainty regarding geologic positioning that could affect recoverable reserves. When considering the factors referenced above, the lower degree of certainty of our possible reserves came from a combination of these factors depending upon the applicable basin. Many of the possible locations assigned in our reserve reports had few uncertainties and resemble proved undeveloped locations except for their distance from commercial production. Other possible locations had uncertainties related to not only distance from commercial production, but also related to well spacing and development timing. In general, we did not book possible locations if there was geologic uncertainty or if there was not commercial production to support such location.
Summary of Reserves. The following table presents our estimated net proved, probable and possible reserves as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, based on our proved, probable and possible reserve estimates as of such dates, which have been prepared or audited, as applicable, by CG&A, our independent petroleum engineering firm, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. All of our proved, probable and possible reserves are located in the United States.

Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Additional information regarding our proved, probable and possible reserves can be found in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and the proved, probable and possible reserve reports as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and 2017, which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report.
PUDs
As of December 31, 2019, we estimated our PUD reserves to be 7,037 MBbls of oil, 28,498 MMcf of natural gas and 3,344 MBbls of NGLs, for a total of 15,131 MBoe. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production.
The following tables summarize our changes in PUDs during the year ended December 31, 2019 (in MBoe):

 | Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Balance, Dec 31, 2018 | 15,153 | 
Acquisition of reserves | 2,069 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 1,815 | 
Revisions of previous estimates | (2,080 | )
Transfer to estimated proved developed | (1,826 | )
Balance, Dec 31, 2019 | 15,131 | 

Changes in PUDs that occurred during 2019 were primarily due to:

• | the acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests located in the Permian, Anadarko, Williston and DJ Basins in multiple transactions, which included 2,069 MBoe of additional PUD reserves;


• | well additions, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1,815 MBoe, as 491 horizontal well locations were converted from probable, possible and contingent resource to PUDs due to continuous activity and delineation of additional zones on our mineral and royalty interests


• | negative revisions of 439 MBoe attributable to a reduction in SEC pricing; reclassification of 925 MBoe to non-proved due to changes in the development timing, primarily in the Anadarko Basin due to decrease in rig activity; revision of 716 MBoe attributable to 2019 NGL processing assumptions, EUR adjustments and Unit configuration; and


• | the conversion of approximately 1,826 MBoe in PUD reserves into proved developed reserves as 346 horizontal locations were drilled and/or completed

As a mineral and royalty interests owner, we do not incur any capital expenditures or lease operating expenses in connection with the development of our PUDs, which costs are borne entirely by the operator. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not have any expenditures to convert PUDs to proved developed reserves.
We identify drilling locations based on our assessment of current geologic, engineering and land data. This includes DSU formation and current well spacing information derived from state agencies and the operations of the exploration and production companies drilling our mineral and royalty interests. We generally do not have evidence of approval of our operators’ development plans, however, we use a deterministic approach to define and allocate locations to proved reserves. While many of our locations qualify as geologic PUDs, we limit our PUDs to the quantities of oil and gas that are reasonably certain to be recovered in the next five years. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 46% and 57%, respectively, of our total proved reserves were classified as PUDs.

Productive Wells
Productive wells consist of producing horizontal wells, wells capable of production and exploratory, development or extension wells that are not dry wells. As of December 31, 2019, we owned mineral and royalty interests in 4,908 gross productive horizontal wells, which consisted of 4,424 oil wells and 484 natural gas wells.
We do not own any working interests in any wells. Accordingly, we do not own any net wells as such term is defined by Item 1208(c)(2) of Regulation S-K.
Acreage
The following table sets forth information relating to our acreage for our mineral and royalty interests as of December 31, 2019:

The vast majority of our mineral and royalty interests are leased to our operators with greater than 85% of our approximately 78,500 leased net royalty acres being held by production as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we had 3,700 net royalty acres that were not leased as of December 31, 2019.
Drilling Results
The following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells turned to production on our properties during the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation among the number of productive wells drilled, the quantities of reserves found and the economic value. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return. As a mineral and royalty interest owner, we generally are not provided information as to whether any wells drilled on the properties underlying our acreage are classified as exploratory.

Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations have the potential to impact production on our properties, including requirements to:

• | obtain permits to conduct regulated activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of drilling and production activities;


• | initiate investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as restoration of drilling pits and plugging of abandoned wells;


• | apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations.

Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of strict, joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations on our properties. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil, natural gas and NGL production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction, drilling, water management, completion, emission or discharge limits or waste handling, disposal or remediation obligations could increase the cost to our operators of developing our properties. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of operations on our properties, causing our operators to incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.
Increased costs or operating restrictions on our properties as a result of compliance with environmental laws could result in reduced exploratory and production activities on our properties and, as a result, our revenues and results of operations. The 
 23

following is a summary of certain existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which operations on our properties are subject.
Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or “CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and entities that transport, dispose of or arrange for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. These responsible persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes generated. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil, natural gas and NGL drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could increase the costs of our operators’ operations.
Certain of our properties have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although the operators may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under our properties, or on or under other offsite locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. Our properties and the petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the owner or operator could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to clean up contaminated property and to perform remedial operations such as restoration of pits and plugging of abandoned wells to prevent future contamination or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action.
Water Discharges and NORM
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States ("WOTUS"). Following the change in U.S. Presidential Administrations, there have been several attempts to modify or eliminate this rule. Most recently, on January 23, 2020, the EPA and Corps replaced the WOTUS rule adopted in 2015 with the narrower Navigable Waters Protection Rule, and litigation is expected. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the CWA is uncertain at this time, and any increase in scope could result in increased costs or delays with respect to obtaining permits for certain activities for our operators. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the Clean Water Act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA,” amends the Clean Water Act and establishes strict liability and natural resource damages liability for unauthorized discharges of oil into waters of the United States. OPA requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
In addition, naturally occurring radioactive material (“NORM”) is brought to the surface in connection with oil and gas production. Concerns have arisen over traditional NORM disposal practices (including discharge through publicly owned treatment works into surface waters), which may increase the costs associated with management of NORM.
 24

Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act of 1963 ("CAA") and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. For example, in June 2016 the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. Separately, in December 2019, the EPA reclassified Colorado’s ozone nonattainment areas under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards from moderate to serious nonattainment; as a result, also in December 2019, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission approved a set of new rules to reduce emissions from oil and gas operations in the state. These revisions could increase the costs of development and production on our properties, potentially impairing the economic development of our properties. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
Climate Change
The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. 
In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implementing GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified, or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission, and storage activities, otherwise known as Subpart OOOOa. Following the change in administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation is ongoing. 
Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulation or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations- sponsored "Paris Agreement," for nations to limit their GHG emissions through non-binding, individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020.
Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. Two critical declarations made by one or more candidates running for the Democratic nomination for President include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as, the reversal of the United Sates' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.
There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel 
 25

energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financing for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.
The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate the GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce the profitability of our interests. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas operators restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce the profitability of our interests. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
A substantial portion of the production on our properties involved the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil, natural gas and NGLs from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.
Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids and issued permitting guidance that applies to such activities. Additionally, the EPA issued final CAA regulations in 2012 and in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of emissions of methane and VOCs released during hydraulic fracturing and separately published in June 2016 an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In August 2019, the EPA proposed amendments to the 2016 standards that, among other things, would remove sources in the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescind the methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the industry. As an alternative, the EPA also proposed to rescind the methane-specific requirements that apply to all sources in the oil and natural gas industry, without removing the transmission and storage sources from the current source category. Legal challenges to any final rulemaking that rescinds the 2016 standards are expected.
Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.
In addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether. Separately, in Texas, there has been increased pressure on the Railroad Commission (“RRC”) to impose more stringent limitations on the flaring of gas from oil wells to prevent waste and because of increased concerns related to the environmental effects of flaring. The RRC continues to approve flaring permits, but at least one lawsuit has been filed by a pipeline operator challenging the RRC’s flaring approval practices. While no regulations have been proposed by the RRC to date, any future requirements limiting flaring could adversely affect exploration and production activities on our properties and result in increased costs to connect wells to pipelines. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For more information on such restrictions in Colorado, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Implementation of new Colorado Senate Bill 19-181 may increase costs and limit oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the state, which could adversely impact future production from our properties and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations." If new federal, state or 
 26

local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect the development of our properties.
Endangered Species Act
The Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause our operators to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in the affected areas. Recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the dunes sagebrush lizard, whose habitat includes the Permian Basin; Lesser Prairie Chicken, which can be found in portions of the Central and Southern Great Plains; and Greater Sage Grouse, which can be found across a large swath of the northwestern United States in oil and gas producing states, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. To the extent species are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or previously unprotected species are designated as threatened or endangered in areas where our properties are located, operations on those properties could incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and face delays or limitations with respect to production activities thereon.
Employee Health and Safety
Operations on our properties are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or “OSHA,” and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Title to Properties
Prior to completing an acquisition of mineral and royalty interests, we perform a title review on each tract to be acquired. Our title review is meant to confirm the quantum of mineral and royalty interest owned by a prospective seller, the property’s lease status and royalty amount as well as encumbrances or other related burdens. For our Texas properties, we obtain a limited title memorandum rendered by an oil and gas law firm. As a result, title examinations have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties.
In addition to our initial title work, operators often will conduct a thorough title examination prior to leasing and/or drilling a well. Should an operator’s title work uncover any further title defects, either we or the operator will perform curative work with respect to such defects. An operator generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until any material title defects on such property have been cured. We believe that the title to our assets is satisfactory in all material respects. Although title to these properties is in some cases subject to encumbrances, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of oil and gas interests, non-participating royalty interests and other burdens, easements, restrictions or minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties.
Competition
The oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of minerals and oil and natural gas leases and personnel required to find and produce reserves. Many of our competitors not only own and acquire mineral and royalty interests but also explore for and produce oil and natural gas and, in some cases, carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. By engaging in such other activities, our competitors may be able to develop or obtain information that is superior to the information that is available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess. Our ability to acquire additional minerals and properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
In addition, oil and natural gas products compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal, and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations, and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas.
 27

Seasonality of Business
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Additionally, some of the areas in which our properties are located are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, our operators may be unable to move their equipment between locations, thereby reducing their ability to operate our wells, reducing the amount of oil and natural gas produced from the wells on our properties during such times. Additionally, extended drought conditions in the areas in which our properties are located could impact our operators’ ability to source sufficient water or increase the cost for such water. Furthermore, demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth quarters. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions can limit drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 41 full-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. 
Legal Proceedings
We are party to lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict the outcome of any such lawsuits with certainty, but management believes it is remote that pending or threatened legal matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
Due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time, involved in other routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities, including workers’ compensation claims and employment related disputes. In the opinion of our management, none of these other pending litigations, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, free cash flow or results of operations.
