ITEM 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We are an internally managed real estate investment trust focused solely on senior housing properties. We hold a geographically diversified portfolio of primarily private pay senior housing properties located across the United States. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was comprised of 103 senior housing properties across 36 states, which positions us as one of the largest owners of senior housing properties in the United States.
We are organized and operate as a single reportable segment, Senior Housing Properties. We changed our structure in 2020 and no longer operate in two reportable segments: Managed Independent Living (“IL”) Properties, and Other Properties. Refer to “Note 6 – Segment Reporting” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.
We were formed as a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Drive Shack Inc., formerly Newcastle Investment Corp. (“Drive Shack”), on May 17, 2012. On November 6, 2014, we were spun off from Drive Shack and listed on the NYSE under the symbol “SNR.” We are headquartered in New York, New York.
Through December 31, 2018, we were externally managed and advised by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (the “Former Manager”). On November 19, 2018, we entered into definitive agreements with the Former Manager to internalize our management, effective January 1, 2019 (the “Internalization”). In connection with the Internalization, we also entered into a Transition Services Agreement with the Former Manager to continue to provide certain services for a transition period. Following the effectiveness of the Internalization, our board of directors concluded its formal review of strategic alternatives, which the Company initially announced in February 2018.
The majority of our portfolio is managed by some of the largest and most experienced operators in the United States. Currently, our managed properties are managed by affiliates or subsidiaries of each of Holiday Retirement (“Holiday”), Merrill Gardens LLC (“Merrill Gardens”), and Grace Management, Inc. (“Grace”). We also own one continuing care retirement community (“CCRC”) and lease this property under a triple net lease agreement to Watermark Retirement Communities, Inc. (“Watermark”), a healthcare operating company. Holiday is among the top three largest senior housing operators in the United States. The assets in our portfolio are described in more detail below under “Our Portfolio.”
Our investment strategy is focused on acquiring private pay senior housing properties. However, from time to time, we may explore new business opportunities and asset categories as part of our business strategy.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic On Our Business
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic is causing significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economies and has contributed to volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The outbreak, which became widespread in the U.S. in early 2020, led federal, state and local governments and public health authorities to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. Some of these measures have persisted into 2021, including in the areas we operate.
As an owner of senior living properties, with a portfolio of 102 IL properties and one CCRC, COVID-19 has impacted, and continues to impact, our business in various ways. Our three property managers and one tenant have all put into place various protocols to address the COVID-19 pandemic at our communities across the U.S. Some of the measures taken at the onset of the pandemic included restrictions on all non-essential visitors (including family), closure of group dining facilities and other common areas, restrictions on resident movements and group activities, as well as enhanced protocols which have required increased labor, property cleaning expenses and costs related to procuring necessary supplies such as meal containers and personal protective equipment (“PPE”). Over the last several months, our managers and tenant have lifted certain restrictions in a phased approach, based on both the status of state and local regulations that affect the property as well as the status of any COVID-19 cases at the property. Lifting restrictions at our properties, particularly restrictions related to onsite visitors, while being done in a measured approach in compliance with all state and local regulations, may contribute to an increase in COVID-19 cases.
COVID-19 has had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on three metrics that are fundamental to our business: occupancy, rental rates and operating expenses. We describe these impacts in more detail throughout “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition.”
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
On February 10, 2020, we completed the sale of all 28 managed assisted living/memory care (“AL/MC”) properties pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2019 (the “Sale Agreement”), for a gross sales price of $385.0 million (“AL/MC Portfolio Disposition”). The sale of these properties represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operations of these properties for the current and prior periods are classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to “Note 4 – Discontinued Operations” for additional details.
In conjunction with the AL/MC Portfolio Disposition, we repaid existing loan agreements and entered into a new financing for $270.0 million which is secured by 14 Senior Housing Properties. We also amended our $125.0 million credit facility (the “Revolver”) secured by nine Senior Housing Properties. The maturity of the Revolver has been extended to February 2024, compared to the previous maturity date in December 2021. The Revolver borrowing capacity may be increased from $125.0 million to $500.0 million, subject to customary terms and conditions.
As a result of these refinancing initiatives, our weighted average debt maturity increased from 4.8 years as of December 31, 2019 to 5.3 years as of December 31, 2020. We have no significant near-term debt maturities until 2025.
During 2020, we did not purchase any properties.
SENIOR HOUSING INDUSTRY
Overview
For an overview of the senior housing industry, see “Opportunity to Consolidate Large and Fragmented Industry” and “Attractive Demand - Supply Fundamentals to Drive Organic Growth.”
Following the completion of the AL/MC Portfolio Disposition, we have only one property in our portfolio that has health care components that are licensed by the state and that participates in Medicare and Medicaid. This property is a CCRC, which has independent living, assisting living (“AL”), memory care (“MC”) and skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) care.
Large and Fragmented Industry
We believe there are significant investment opportunities in the U.S. senior housing market driven by three factors: (i) long-term demand growth from significant increases in the senior citizen population, (ii) highly fragmented ownership of senior housing properties among many smaller local and regional owner/operators and (iii) operational improvement opportunities to increase property-level net operating income. We estimate the size of the senior housing industry in the United States to be approximately $350 billion, and, according to the 2020 American Seniors Housing Association 50 Report, approximately 65% of these senior housing facilities are owned by operators with 10 or fewer properties.
Attractive Demand - Supply Fundamentals
We believe that the rapidly growing senior citizen population in the U.S. will result in a substantially increased demand over time for senior housing properties as the baby boomer generation ages, life expectancies lengthen and more health-related services are demanded. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the total number of people aged 65 and older is expected to increase from approximately 49.2 million in 2016 to 78.0 million by 2035, with the number of citizens aged 65 and older expected to grow at four times the rate of the overall population by 2035. Healthcare is the largest private-sector industry in the U.S., with healthcare expenditures in the U.S. accounting for approximately 18% of gross domestic product in 2019. According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the average annual compounded growth rate for national healthcare expenditures from 2019 through 2028 is expected to be 5.4%. Additionally, senior citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services. The target age group for our properties is seniors over 70 years old while a typical resident is 80 to 85 years of age. According to CMS, average per capita healthcare expenditures by those 65 years and older continue to be about three times more than the average spent by those 19 to 64 years old. Demand for senior housing is driven both by growth of an aging population and by an increasing array of services and support required by residents. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of Americans over 65 years of age seeking assistance with basic and instrumental activities of daily living is 20%, increasing to 27% for Americans over 75 years of age. To address these resident needs, senior housing provides varying and flexible levels of services. While our target population is growing, industry occupancy has been impacted by an elevated level of new supply in recent years. However, the ratio of units under construction to existing inventory has declined for nine consecutive quarters, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care (“NIC”).
Differentiated Strategy Focused on Private Pay Senior Housing
We have generally sought investments in senior housing facilities that have an emphasis on private pay sources of revenue which we believe is more stable and predictable compared to government reimbursed property types. We believe this strategy distinguishes us from our publicly-traded peers. Private pay residents are individuals who are personally obligated to pay the costs of their housing and services without relying significantly on reimbursement payments from Medicaid or Medicare. Sources for these private payments include: (i) pensions, savings and retirement funds; (ii) proceeds from the sale of real estate and personal property; (iii) assistance from residents’ families; and (iv) private insurance. While our investments may have minimal level of revenues related to government reimbursements, we focus on investments with high levels of private pay revenue and, for the year ended December 31, 2020, private pay sources represented 99.8% of the property level revenue from continuing operations derived from the residents at our facilities. Private pay facilities are not subject to governmental rate setting and, accordingly, we believe they provide for more predictable and higher rental rates from residents than facilities primarily reliant on government-funded sources.
The senior housing industry offers a full continuum of care to seniors with product types that range from “mostly housing” (i.e., senior apartments) to “mostly healthcare” (i.e., skilled nursing, hospitals, etc.). We primarily focus on product types at the center of this continuum, namely IL properties and, prior to the AL/MC Portfolio Disposition, AL/MC properties. Many of our peers have significant exposure to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals providing higher acuity levels of healthcare. Accordingly, these peers have higher levels of exposure to revenues derived from Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements. Our facilities are predominantly reliant on private pay sources of revenue and have reduced risk exposure to regulatory changes in the healthcare arena. We believe that our focused portfolio of primarily IL properties will allow investors to participate in the positive fundamentals of the senior housing sector without similar levels of risk exposure associated with higher acuity types of healthcare real estate. 
Attractive, Geographically Diverse Portfolio 
We started building our platform in July 2012 and owned 103 properties with a gross real estate value of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our portfolio is geographically diverse, with a presence in 36 different states. As of December 31, 2020, we had 102 IL properties and one rental CCRC. All of our IL properties are owned on a managed basis while our CCRC property is leased.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our CCRC and its operations are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need (“CON”) and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare properties. While the CCRC within our portfolio is subject to varying types of regulatory and licensing requirements, we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation, enforcement and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, 
among others. In fact, some states have revised and strengthened their regulation of senior housing properties and that trend may continue. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as Governmental Programs (as defined below) and private insurance payor organizations (which include insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other types of health plans/managed care organizations) to impose more stringent controls upon operators are expected to intensify and continue. Changes in applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
As used in this section, “Governmental Program” means, individually and collectively, any federal, state or local governmental reimbursement programs administered through a governmental body, agency thereof or contractor thereof (including a Governmental Program Payor) including, without limitation, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, waiver programs under the aforementioned programs or successor programs to any of the aforementioned programs. “Governmental Program Payor” means a private insurance payor organization which has a contract with a Governmental Program to arrange for the provision of assisted living property or SNF services to Governmental Program beneficiaries and which receives reimbursement from the Governmental Program to do so.
Our CCRC is regulated by state and local laws governing licensure, provision of services, staffing requirements and other operational matters. Owners and/or operators of certain senior housing properties, are required to be licensed or certified by the state in which they operate. In granting and renewing such licenses, the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations, including, but not limited to, admission and discharge standards, staffing and training. A decision to grant or renew a license may also be affected by a property’s record with respect to licensure compliance, patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines and other regulations. Certain states require additional licensure and impose additional staffing and other operational standards in order for a property to provide higher levels of assisted living services. Senior housing properties may also be subject to state and/or local building, zoning, fire and food service laws before licensing or certification may be granted. Senior housing properties may also be subject to additional building code requires under the licensing process such as the National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code and these components may be more restrictive than local residential building codes. Our CCRC may also be affected by changes in accreditation standards or procedures of accreditation bodies that are recognized by states or a Governmental Program in the licensure or certification process.
In the future, we may also acquire senior housing properties that include SNFs. SNFs are licensed by the state in which the facility is located, and, if an owner chooses to participate in Medicaid, Medicare or certain other Governmental Programs, the facility must also be certified to participate in such programs. In that regard, SNFs are particularly subject to myriad, comprehensive federal Medicare and Medicaid certification requirements that not only require state licensure but also separately (apart from state licensure) regulate the type, quantity and quality of the medical and/or nursing care provided, ancillary services (e.g., respiratory, occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate setting and other operational issues and policies.
In the future, we may also acquire certain healthcare properties (including assisted living properties in some states and SNFs in most states) that are subject to a variety of CON or similar laws. Where applicable, such laws generally require, among other requirements, as a prerequisite to licensure that a facility demonstrate the need for (i) constructing a new facility, (ii) adding beds or expanding an existing facility, (iii) investing in major capital equipment or adding new services, (iv) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility, or (v) terminating services that have been previously approved through the CON process. These laws could affect, and even restrict, our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our properties and services in existing markets. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator. If we have to replace a facility operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state healthcare program (as discussed below), our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s CON laws, regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control.
Aside from CON considerations, transfers of ownership, provider control and/or operations of assisted living properties and SNFs are subject to licensure and other regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and real estate. These regulations may also constrain or even impede our ability to replace property managers or tenant of our properties, and they may also impact our acquisition or sale of senior housing properties. In addition, if any of our licensed properties operate outside of its licensed authority, doing so could subject the facility to penalties, including fines, a denial of new admissions, suspension of its license, revocation of its license or closure of the facility. Failure to obtain licensure or loss or suspension of licensure or certification may prevent an assisted living property or SNF from operating or result in a suspension of Governmental Program reimbursement payment until all licensure or certification issues have been resolved.
The level of assisted living Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues generated by our CCRC may be adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level, changes in Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels. In addition, a state could lose its Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize Medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services. Such changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Many states are now reimbursing providers of long term care services, which includes SNFs, through mandatory Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (“MMCOs”). These arrangements may result in an increase in denied claims and/or reduced Medicaid rates as a result of contracting pressures. 
A significant portion of the revenues received by our CCRC is from self-pay residents. The remaining revenue source is primarily Medicare and Medicaid under certain federal waiver programs. As a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (“OBRA”), Congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer Medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. The provisions of OBRA and subsequent federal enactments permit states to seek a waiver from typical Medicaid requirements to develop cost-effective alternatives to long-term care, including Medicaid payments for assisted living and, in some instances, including payment for such services through Governmental Program Payors. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status that funding levels will not decrease or that eligibility requirements will not change.
Rates paid by self-pay residents of properties within our managed properties are determined in accordance with applicable provisions of the management agreements entered into with our property managers, and are impacted by local market conditions and operating costs. Rates paid by self-pay residents of our triple net lease property are determined by the tenant.
Unlike assisted living operators, SNF operators typically receive most of their revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private insurance payor organizations (and perhaps minimal self-pay). Consequently, changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect our business if we acquire properties with a SNF component.
The percentage of federal Medicaid revenue support used for long-term care varies from state to state, due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements. Within certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and to establish a reimbursement methodology for SNF Medicaid patients. Many states reimburse SNFs pursuant to fixed daily Medicaid rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing, administrative and general expenses, property and equipment (e.g., real estate taxes, depreciation and fair rental).
The Medicare SNF benefit covers skilled nursing care, rehabilitation services and other goods and services, and the facility receives a pre-determined daily rate for each day of care, up to 100 days. These prospective payment system (“PPS”) rates are expected to cover all operating and capital costs that efficient properties would be expected to incur in furnishing most SNF services, with certain high-cost, low-probability ancillary services paid separately.
There is a risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs could exceed the fixed payments under the prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities (“SNF PPS”), and there is also a risk that payments under the SNF PPS may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services, which could have a material adverse effect on an SNF. Further, SNFs are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities. Such a review or audit could result in recoupments, denials, or delay of payments in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the business of a SNF. In addition, the implementation of the “Patient Driven Payment Model” which revises the payment classification system for therapy services in skilled nursing facilities, may impact reimbursement by revising the classifications of certain patients.
In the ordinary course of business, our CCRC has been and is subject regularly to inspections, inquiries, investigations and audits by state agencies that oversee applicable laws and regulations. State licensure laws and, where applicable, Governmental Program certification, require license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or bi-annual basis. The failure of our CCRC to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval, as well as the failure of our managers to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey, could result in the suspension of operations at a property. In addition, if our CCRC, where applicable, is found to be out of compliance with Governmental Program conditions of participation, the property’s manager may be excluded from participating in those Governmental Programs. Any such occurrence may impair the ability of a property manager to meet its obligations. If we have to replace a property manager, our ability to do so may be affected by the federal and state regulations governing such changes. This may result in payment delays, an inability to find a 
replacement property manager or other difficulties. Unannounced surveys or inspections of a property may occur annually or bi-annually or following a regulator’s receipt of a complaint regarding the property. From time-to-time, our properties receive deficiency reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Most deficiencies are resolved through a plan of corrective action relating to the property’s operations but, whether the deficiencies are cured or not, the applicable governmental authority typically has the authority to take further action against a licensee. Such an action could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license or Governmental Program participation, suspension or denial of admissions or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. The imposition of such sanctions may adversely affect our business.
SNF, CCRCs and properties participating in Medicaid waiver programs (collectively, “Licensed Healthcare Properties”) that participate in Governmental Programs are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, including implementing regulations and applicable governmental guidance that govern the operational, financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare properties and other providers. Certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by Governmental Programs. All healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, assisted living properties and SNFs that participate in Governmental Programs, are also subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a criminal statute which generally prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal Governmental Program. SNFs and certain other types of healthcare properties and providers are also subject to the Federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the Stark Law. Many states have similar prohibitions on physician self-referrals and submission of claims which are applicable to all payor sources, including state Medicaid programs.
Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the Governmental Program and Governmental Program Payors valid and accurate statements for each service, and other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from any Governmental Program participation. In certain circumstances, violation of these laws (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior and, in the case of Governmental Program Payors, also prohibiting insurance fraud) with respect to one property may subject other properties under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in Governmental Programs. In the ordinary course of business, our properties are regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws.
Further, healthcare properties and other providers, including, but not limited to, assisted living properties and SNFs, that receive Governmental Program payments, are subject to substantial financial and other (in some cases, criminal) penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act, the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the Federal False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” provisions. Violations of these laws can also subject persons and entities to termination from participation in Governmental Programs or result in the imposition of substantial damages, fines or other penalties. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits brought by private individuals, known as “qui tam actions,” may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients, nurses and other employees. Significantly, if a claim is successfully adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages in addition to penalties up to $22,363 per claim. Various state false claim act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property operator, regardless of payor source (i.e., such as a private insurance payor organization or a Governmental Program), and violations of those state laws can also result in substantial fines and/or adverse licensure actions to our material detriment.
Government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the healthcare industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue. Some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the Federal False Claims Act. Governmental agencies, both state and federal, are also devoting increasing attention and resources to anti-fraud initiatives against healthcare properties and other providers. Legislative developments, including changes to federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly expanded the definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include certain private insurance payor organizations in addition to Governmental Programs. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to audit, investigate and prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Moreover, a significant portion of the 
billions in healthcare fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts. Responding to, and defending against, any of these potential government investigations and enforcement actions, or any state or federal false claims act actions, is expensive, and the cost, including attorneys’ fees, may be substantial and adversely impact our performance. Any of these actions could result in a financial payment to state and federal authorities, which payments could adversely impact our performance. In addition, the Office of Inspector General could require in the settlement of an investigation that some or all of our facilities operate under a Corporate Integrity Agreement for a number of years, which could be costly and adversely affect our performance.
HIPAA regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In order to comply with the regulations, healthcare providers that meet the definition of a Covered Entity as defined by HIPAA often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), passed in February 2009, strengthened the HHS Secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure that covered entities and their business associates (as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HITECH requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. The CMS issued an interim final rule which conformed HIPAA enforcement regulations to HITECH, increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to $1.5 million. Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions. Additionally, on January 17, 2013, the CMS released a final rule, which expands the applicability of HIPAA and HITECH and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws. The final rule broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place. Additionally, the final rule adopts certain changes to the HIPAA enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by HITECH, and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under HIPAA for compliance with certain of the HIPAA privacy standards and HIPAA security standards. HIPAA violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the HealthCare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the Affordable Care Act (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), and the June 28, 2012 United States Supreme Court ruling upholding the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws and partially invalidating the expansion of Medicaid (further discussed below) may have a significant impact on Medicare, Medicaid and other Governmental Programs, as well as private insurance payor organizations, which in turn may impact the reimbursement amounts received by our properties which participate in Governmental Programs. In fact, the Health Reform Laws could have a substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly involved in the healthcare system. Together, the Health Reform Laws make the most sweeping and fundamental changes to the U.S. healthcare system undertaken since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid and contain various provisions that may directly impact our business.
Finally, entities that run IL facilities, AL facilities and SNFs can be subject to private causes of action that may be brought by plaintiff’s counsel against these facilities, which can raise allegations under state law facilities for among other things elder abuse, wrongful death, negligence, failure to provide care and for other causes of action designed to redress injuries allegedly suffered by residents. These actions can be brought as class actions, and whether pursued on behalf of an individual or a class may result in substantial financial recoveries.
These Health Reform Laws include, without limitation, the expansion of Medicaid eligibility, requiring most individuals to have health insurance, establishing new regulations on certain private insurance payor organizations (including Governmental Program Payors), establishing health insurance exchanges and modifying certain payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste, including through new tools to address fraud and abuse. Because many of our properties deliver healthcare services, we will be impacted by the risks associated with the healthcare industry, including the Health Reform Laws. While the expansion of healthcare coverage may result in some additional demand for services provided by our properties, reimbursement levels may be lower than the costs required to provide such services, which could materially adversely affect our business. The Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions in the event of one or more violations of the federal healthcare regulatory laws. In addition, the Health Reform Laws have provisions that impact the health coverage that our property managers or tenant provide to their respective employees. We cannot predict whether the existing Health Reform Laws, or future healthcare reform legislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our business.
Additionally, certain provisions of the Health Reform Laws are designed to increase transparency and program integrity of SNFs. Specifically, SNFs will be required to institute compliance and ethics programs. Additionally, the Health Reform Laws make it easier for consumers to file complaints against nursing homes by mandating that states establish complaint websites. The provisions calling for enhanced transparency will increase the administrative burden and costs on SNF providers.
OUR PORTFOLIO
The key characteristics of our senior housing portfolio, excluding properties classified as discontinued operations, are set forth in the tables below (dollars in thousands):

 | | | As of December 31, | | Year Ended December 31, | 
Year | Number of Communities | Number of Beds | Real Estate Investments, at Cost (A) | | | Real Estate Investment per Bed | Total Revenues (B) | | | | Number of States
2020 | 103 | 12,438 | | $ | 2,125,648 | | | $ | 171 | | | $ | 336,281 | | 36
2019 | 103 | 12,439 | | 2,112,321 | | | 170 | | | 345,903 | | | | 36

(A) Real estate investments, at cost represents the gross carrying value of real estate before accumulated depreciation and amortization.
(B) Revenues relate to the period the properties were owned by us in a calendar year and, therefore, are not indicative of full-year results for all properties. 
We classify our properties by asset type and operating model, as described in more detail below.
Product Type
IL Properties: IL properties are age-restricted, multifamily properties with central dining that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities. A typical resident is 80 to 85 years old and is relatively healthy. Residents are typically charged all-inclusive monthly rates.
CCRC Properties: CCRCs are a particular type of retirement community that offer several levels (generally more than three) of health care at one facility or campus, often including independent living, assisted living/memory care and skilled nursing. CCRCs offer a tiered approach to the aging process, accommodating residents’ changing needs as they age. 
Former AL/MC Properties: Prior to the AL/MC Portfolio Disposition, we also focused on AL/MC properties, which are state-regulated rental properties that provide the same services as IL properties and additionally have staff to provide residents assistance with activities of daily living, such as management of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating. AL/MC properties may include memory care properties that specifically provide care for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia or memory loss. The average age of an AL/MC resident is similar to that of an IL resident, but AL/MC residents typically have greater healthcare needs. Residents are typically charged all-inclusive monthly rates for IL services and additional “care charges” for AL/MC services, which vary depending on the types of services required. AL/MC properties are generally private pay, although many states will allow residents to cover a portion of the cost with Medicaid. 
Operating Model
Our current operating model is focused on Managed Properties and our Triple Net Lease Property. 
Managed Properties: We have entered into long-term property management agreements for our managed properties with Holiday, Merrill Gardens, and Grace. Our property management agreements have initial five-year or 10-year terms, with successive, automatic one-year renewal periods. We pay property management fees of 4.5% to 5.0% of effective gross income pursuant to our property management agreements and, in some cases, the property managers are eligible to earn an incentive fee based on operating performance. As the owner of the Managed Properties, we are responsible for the properties’ operating costs, including maintenance, utilities, taxes, insurance, repairs, capital improvements and the payroll expense of property-level employees. The payroll expense is structured as a reimbursement to the property manager, who is the employer of record. We have various rights as the property owner under our property management agreements, including rights to set budget guidelines and to terminate and exercise remedies under those agreements as provided therein. However, we rely on our property managers’ personnel, expertise, technical accounting resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior housing operations efficiently and effectively. We also rely on our property managers to otherwise operate our properties in compliance with the terms of the management agreements, although we have various rights as the property owner to terminate and exercise remedies under the management agreements.
Triple Net Lease Property: We own one CCRC that is leased to the tenant pursuant to a triple net lease. Our triple net lease arrangement has an initial term of approximately 15 years and includes renewal options and annual rent increases ranging from 2.75% to 3.25%. Under the triple net lease, the tenant is typically responsible for (i) operating its portion of the portfolio and bearing the related costs, including maintenance, utilities, taxes, insurance, repairs, capital improvements, and the payroll expense of property-level employees, and (ii) complying with the terms of the mortgage financing documents.
Prior to 2019, we had additional triple net lease agreements with affiliates of Holiday. On May 9, 2018, we entered into a lease termination agreement to terminate our triple net leases with affiliates of Holiday relating to 51 IL properties (the “Holiday Portfolio”). The lease termination was effective May 14, 2018 (the “Lease Termination”). Concurrently with the Lease Termination, we entered into property management agreements with Holiday to manage the properties in the Holiday Portfolio following the Lease Termination in exchange for a property management fee. As a result, such properties are now included in the Managed Properties operating model. Refer to “Note 3 – Lease Termination” to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.
FINANCING STRATEGY
Our ability to access capital in a timely and cost effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to make future investments. Our access to and cost of external capital are dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the trading price of our common stock.
We employ leverage as part of our investment strategy. We do not have a predetermined target debt to equity ratio as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality of those assets. We utilize leverage for the sole purpose of financing our portfolio and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. We strive to maintain our financial strength and invest profitably by actively managing our leverage, optimizing our capital structure and developing our access to multiple sources of liquidity. Historically, we have relied primarily on non-recourse U.S. government agency financing to finance a portion of our real estate investments. We may, over time, seek access to additional sources of liquidity, including revolving credit agreements, bank debt, the unsecured public debt and equity markets. Generally, we attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in senior housing properties with staggered maturities of long-term debt and equity. As of December 31, 2020, 69.2% of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt.
Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may, from time to time, utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. These derivative instruments may include interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, interest rate floor or collar agreements or other financial instruments that we deem appropriate.
POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OTHER ACTIVITIES
Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we have the authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our common stock or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future.
We also may make loans to, or provide guarantees of certain obligations of, our subsidiaries.
Subject to the percentage ownership and gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.
We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments.
Our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders.
In the event that we determine to raise additional equity capital, our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval (subject to certain NYSE requirements), to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for property.
OPERATIONAL AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE
REIT Qualification
We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. Commencing with our initial taxable year ending December 31, 2014, we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and we believe that our intended manner of operation will continue to enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
COMPETITION
We generally compete for investments in senior housing with other market participants, such as other REITs, real estate partnerships, private equity and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies, finance and investment companies, government-sponsored agencies, healthcare operators, developers and other investors. Many of our anticipated competitors are significantly larger than we are, have better access to capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could lead them to offer higher prices for assets that we might be interested in acquiring and cause us to lose bids for those assets. In addition, other potential purchasers of senior housing properties may be more attractive to sellers of senior housing properties if the sellers believe that these potential purchasers could obtain any necessary third party approvals and consents more easily than us.
Our property managers and tenant compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties that provide comparable services. Operators compete for residents based on a number of factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, location, services offered, family preferences, staff and price. We also face competition from other healthcare facilities for residents, such as physicians and other healthcare providers that provide comparable properties and services, as well as home care options, including technology-enabled home health care options.
SEASONALITY
There are slight seasonal impacts in our business, with move-in volumes generally being slightly stronger in the summer months and lower in the colder winter months, and utility costs generally being higher in the first and third quarters of each year due to colder temperature and warmer temperatures, respectively. These seasonal impacts have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which among other things suppressed move-in volumes throughout the year due to restrictions and protocols in place. Refer to “Item 1. "Business- Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic On Our Business" of this Annual Report Form 10-K for additional details.
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL
As of December 31, 2020, we had 17 full-time employees and an eight-member Board of Directors with a diverse mix of women and men in management, leadership, and board positions. We strive to maintain a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by law. We conduct annual trainings to prevent harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round. 
We believe that our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and recognized appropriately for outstanding performance. Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent. We continually assess and strive to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement. Our employees are offered opportunities to participate in professional development programs at the Company’s expense.
Prior to the Internalization, we did not have any employees. Our officers and other individuals who provided services to us prior to the Internalization were employed by the Former Manager. In connection with the Internalization, we hired 16 of the 17 employees who had supported our business while employed by the Former Manager, including two of our executive officers.
As the owner of managed properties, we are responsible for the payroll expense of property-level employees (as well as the properties’ other operating costs). The payroll expense is structured as a reimbursement to the property manager, who is the employer of record.
