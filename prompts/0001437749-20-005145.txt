AZEDRA®
 

● | AZEDRA. We presented data to the ICD-10 Coordination and Maintenance Committee to garner a code associated with AZEDRA which supports our efforts to secure New Technology Add-On Payment (NTAP). The ICD-10 Coordination and Maintenance Committee is comprised of representatives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In addition, our pass-through C code was approved and is in place, and our permanent A code was awarded in January 2020. In October 2019, we initiated a global managed access program to provide AZEDRA outside of the U.S. AZEDRA (iobenguane I 131) 555 MBq/mL injection for intravenous use. AZEDRA, which is a registered trademark, is a radiotherapeutic that is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with iobenguane scan positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who require systemic anticancer therapy. AZEDRA is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for this indication. AZEDRA’s approved U.S. label and full U.S. prescribing information are available at www.AZEDRA.com.

● | AZEDRA Manufacturing. In February 2019, we acquired the AZEDRA manufacturing assets for $8.0 million cash consideration and entered into a sublease agreement for the radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Somerset, New Jersey. The Somerset site serves as the manufacturing facility for AZEDRA and will also provide manufacturing support for our development stage radiopharmaceuticals, including 1095. The production of AZEDRA uses a proprietary Ultratrace® process which concentrates the MIBG targeted radiolytic activity by eliminating non-therapeutic “cold” MIBG molecules, giving AZEDRA a uniquely high specific activity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AZEDRA Life Cycle Management. We received comments from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on our proposed life cycle management program to evaluate AZEDRA in patients with other neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). We are currently on clinical hold until we reach agreement with the FDA on a regulatory path forward. If we reach agreement with the FDA, we anticipate our efforts in this area to commence later this year.

Digital Technology:
 

● | PSMA AI is an imaging analysis technology that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to quantify and automate the reading of PSMA-targeted imaging. We recently completed a performance study of our automated segmentation algorithms with PyL/CT images from our PyL research access initiative. The study demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our fully automated segmentation algorithm of the 49 bones and 12 soft tissue regions of the whole body from PyL-PSMA PET/CT images. The deep learning algorithms demonstrated a Sørensen–Dice score of 0.90 or higher in segmenting anatomical structures in the low dose CT portion of a PyL PET/CT. This work provides automated generation of lesion quantification, localization and staging, therefore leading to highly contextualized assessments of disease burden.

Clinical Trial Activities

For the purposes of this report, Phase 1 clinical trials evaluate safety, dosing, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action; Phase 2 clinical trials evaluate safety, dosing and efficacy; and Phase 3 clinical trials evaluate larger patient populations for safety and efficacy.
 
Our practice is and has been to announce commencement and results of all our significant clinical trials in press releases, medical and scientific meetings, and other venues. The following is a summary of current clinical trial activities involving our principal product candidates.
 
PyL. PyL is a clinical-stage fluorinated PSMA-targeted PET imaging agent for prostate cancer. PyL has shown potential for use in detecting metastatic and recurrent prostate cancer, as well as staging of high risk disease. We have an exclusive worldwide license (excluding Australia and New Zealand) to develop and commercialize PyL in PET imaging applications.
 
In October 2018, we announced results of a Phase 2/3 OSPREY trial that assessed the diagnostic performance of PyL to detect prostate cancer in pelvic lymph nodes in patients with high risk locally advanced prostate cancer (Cohort A, N=268) and distant metastases in patients with metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer (Cohort B, N=117). In the trial, the diagnostic performance of PyL in detecting disease in pelvic lymph nodes (Cohort A) showed specificity of 96-99% and sensitivity of 31-42%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of pelvic lymph node detection were 78-91% and 81-84%, respectively. In the metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer setting (Cohort B), PyL exhibited sensitivity of 93-99% and PPV of 81-88% in detecting metastatic lesions. Specificity and negative predictive value were not endpoints specified in the protocol for Cohort B as all men in Cohort B were suspected to have disease. Overall, PyL demonstrated high sensitivity in reliably detecting distant metastatic prostate cancer lesions and high specificity in confirming the absence of pelvic lymph node disease. The associated strong positive predictive values and negative predictive value of PyL imaging in these disease settings indicate its potential high clinical utility.

PyL was safe and well-tolerated by all dosed subjects. A total of 81 treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were reported in 51 (13.2%) subjects with the most common being fatigue (1.3%), dysgeusia (2.6%), and headache (2.3%). A total of five subjects (1.3%) experienced TEAE(s) that were ≥ Grade 3 in severity; all were Grade 3 and no subjects experienced Grade 4 or 5 adverse events. A total of seven serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have been reported within the protocol-specified period in subjects who received PyL. All of the SAEs were assessed as unrelated to the study drug.
 
In December 2019, we announced the results from a prospective, multicenter, open label pivotal Phase 3 CONDOR trial evaluating the diagnostic performance and clinical impact of PyL in men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer and uninformative baseline imaging based on conventional modalities. The study enrolled 208 patients at 14 sites in the United States and Canada. The CONDOR trial achieved its primary endpoint, with a correct localization rate (CLR) of 84.8% to 87.0% among the three blinded independent readers (the lower bound of the 95% confidence intervals ranging from 77.8% to 80.4%). CLR is based on positive predictive value, defined as the percentage of patients with a one-to-one correspondence between localization of at least one lesion identified on PyL PET/CT and a composite truth standard comprised of histopathology, conventional imaging and/or changes in PSA levels following radiation therapy.
 
Safety results showed PyL was well tolerated and consistent with the Phase 2/3 OSPREY trial results. There was one serious adverse event of hypersensitivity reported in one patient as related to the study drug. The most frequent adverse event reported was headache, which was reported in four patients (1.9% of the trial population).
 

In addition to our sponsored studies and clinical trial collaborations, the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of PyL are also being explored in investigator sponsored studies at various academic institutions.
 
1404. We conducted five Phase 1 trials with 1404 in healthy volunteers as well as men with prostate cancer, to establish proof-of-concept and dosimetry, and to assess a simplified kit preparation as compared to multi-step preparation. We then conducted a Phase 2 trial in the U.S. and Europe to assess the safety and ability of 1404 to detect prostate cancer within the prostate gland. Analysis of 1404 SPECT/CT images from this study showed that uptake of 1404 in the lobes of the prostate gland correlated significantly with Gleason score (p<0.0001). No deaths, serious adverse events, or adverse events leading to discontinuations occurred during the study. Of the 105 subjects who received a 1404 injection, four subjects reported a total of ten TEAEs with one related to 1404 (infusion site extravasation). No discernible trends in hematology, clinical chemistries, vital signs, or physical findings were observed during the study.
 
Based on results from these studies, a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 trial was initiated in December 2015 to evaluate the (i) specificity of 1404 to detect clinically insignificant prostate cancer and (ii) sensitivity of 1404 to detect clinically significant disease in patients with newly-diagnosed or low-grade prostate cancer, whose biopsy indicates a histopathologic Gleason grade of ≤3+4 severity and/or were candidates for active surveillance. In December 2017, we completed enrollment (N=471) in the Phase 3 trial. Median PSA levels for patients dosed in trial was 5.58 ng/mL (range 0.69 – 16.03). In the study, 1404 detected clinically meaningful prostate cancer with specificity ranging among the three readers from 71-75% (95% confidence interval CI of 64% to 80%). The co-primary endpoint of sensitivity was not met and ranged amongst the three readers from 47-51% (95% CI of 41% to 56%). The trial protocol required the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for both specificity and sensitivity to exceed 60%. The most frequent treatment related events included headache (2.3%), dizziness (1.1%) and fatigue (0.8%). In November 2018, based on the 1404 data and an assessment of the PSMA-targeted imaging agent commercial landscape, we decided to focus our efforts on our PyL PSMA-targeted PET/CT imaging agent and not to further invest in 1404.
 
1095. In May 2019, we announced the initiation of a multicenter, randomized, controlled Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of 1095 in combination with enzalutamide compared to enzalutamide alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are PSMA-avid, chemotherapy naïve for CRPC, and progressed on abiraterone. In this trial, PSMA-avidity is determined by utilizing PyL, the Company’s PET imaging agent in clinical development designed to visualize prostate cancer. 1095 radiotherapy represents a new mechanism of action that may overcome resistance developed to novel androgen axis drugs (NAADs), such as abiraterone and enzalutamide. In addition, recent preclinical research reported that enzalutamide can sensitize cells to radiotherapy induced cell death, suggesting that 1095 in combination with enzalutamide has the potential to be an effective treatment paradigm for patients with mCRPC who are resistant to NAADs.

As of January 30, 2020, 9 patients have been dosed with I-131-1095+enzalutamide and 2 patients with enzalutamide alone. No dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. There were 22 AEs that were related or possibly related to 1095. There were 8 serious adverse events and none of them were determined to be related or possibly related to the study drug. The most frequent adverse events reported were thrombocytopenia and fatigue. Overall, 1095 has been safe and well tolerated and the independent data monitoring committee has recommended the study continue without modifications.
 
The trial is expected to randomize approximately 120 patients at 40 sites in the U.S. and Canada. The study’s primary endpoint is prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria defined as a confirmed 50% or greater decline from baseline. Key secondary endpoints evaluate radiographic response based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) for soft tissue or PCWG3 for bone, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients will be followed for one year after their first treatment for all efficacy endpoints. Survival and safety data will be collected for an additional year.
 
License Agreements and Other Arrangements 
 
Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals, Inc. License Agreements

In January 2013, we acquired Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“MIP”) by purchasing all of its outstanding capital stock for 4.5 million shares of our common stock in a private transaction. Under the agreement, we also agreed to pay to the former stockholders potential milestones, in cash or our stock at our option, of up to $23.0 million contingent upon achieving specified commercialization events (of which $8.0 million for the first commercial sale of AZEDRA has already been paid in 2019) and up to $70.0 million contingent upon achieving specified sales targets relating to the acquired company’s products. The timing of any such payments, if any, remains uncertain.
 
In addition to utilizing our own proprietary technology, we have a number of agreements with owners of intellectual property which we use or believe may be useful in the research, development and commercialization of product candidates, including:
 

● | A 2012 co-exclusive license agreement with the University of Zurich and the Paul Scherrer Institute for worldwide sublicensable rights to certain intellectual property related to production methodologies relevant to 1404. Under this agreement, we maintain related patent rights and are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on products using the licensed technology, license maintenance fees creditable against royalties, an annual fee for an option to expand the license’s field of use, and clinical and regulatory milestone payments aggregating to approximately $1.5 million. The agreement may be terminated by the licensors upon certain material defaults by, and automatically terminates upon certain bankruptcy events relating to MIP and may be terminated by us on prior written notice.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The 2003 exclusive license agreements with The University of Western Ontario for worldwide sublicensable rights to certain intellectual property relates to production methodologies and alternative approaches for preparing AZEDRA. This alternative technology has not been implemented. Under the 2003 agreement, we maintain related patent rights and are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on products using the licensed technology, minimum annual royalties creditable against royalties and clinical and regulatory milestone payments aggregating to approximately $0.3 million.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have also entered into a number of in-license and out-license agreements, such as:
 
In-License Agreement
 

● | An August 2015 agreement with Johns Hopkins University (“JHU”), granting us exclusive worldwide rights (with the exception of Australia and New Zealand) for PyL. Under this agreement, we are obligated to pay milestone payments, low single-digit royalties, patent costs and minimum annual royalties which are creditable against royalties, aggregating to approximately $2.9 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Out-License Agreements
 

● | An April 2016 agreement with Bayer, granting Bayer exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products using our PSMA antibody technology, in combination with Bayer’s alpha-emitting radionuclides. Bayer is developing PSMA TTC, a thorium-227 labeled PSMA-targeted antibody therapeutic. Bayer initiated a Phase 1 trial of PSMA TTC in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $4.0 million and milestone payments totaling $5.0 million and could receive up to an additional $44.0 million in potential clinical and development milestones. We are also entitled to single-digit royalties on net sales, and potential net sales milestone payments up to an aggregate of $130.0 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A December 2018 agreement with Curium, granting Curium exclusive sublicense to develop, manufacture and commercialize PyL in Europe. Curium will be responsible for the development, regulatory approvals and commercialization of PyL in Europe. Curium is in discussions with EMA regarding the development path in Europe. Under this agreement, we are entitled to double-digit royalties on net sales of PyL.

 RELISTOR License Agreement

RELISTOR® is a registered trademark and refers to methylnaltrexone – the active ingredient of RELISTOR – as it has been and is being developed and commercialized by or in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bausch Health Companies Inc. (“Bausch”, which is the predecessor of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.), under a license agreement (the “RELISTOR License Agreement”). Under the RELISTOR License Agreement, Bausch is responsible for developing and commercializing RELISTOR worldwide, including completing clinical development necessary to support regulatory marketing approvals for potential new indications and formulations, and marketing and selling the product. Bausch is marketing RELISTOR directly through its specialty sales force in the U.S., and outside the U.S. directly through distribution and marketing partners. Under the RELISTOR License Agreement, we recognized a development milestone payment of $40.0 million upon U.S. marketing approval for subcutaneous RELISTOR in non-cancer pain patients in 2014, a development milestone payment of $50.0 million for the U.S. marketing approval of an oral formulation of RELISTOR in July 2016 and a $10.0 million sales milestone for achieving RELISTOR U.S. net sales in excess of $100.0 million in 2019. We are also eligible to receive up to $190.0 million of one-time sales milestone payments upon achievement of specified U.S. net sales targets, including:

U.S. Net Sales Levels in any Single Calendar Year | Payment | 
--------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------
 | (In thousands) | 
In excess of $150 million | $ | 15,000 
In excess of $200 million | | 20,000 
In excess of $300 million | | 30,000 
In excess of $750 million | | 50,000 
In excess of $1 billion | | 75,000 
 | $ | 190,000

 
Each sales milestone payment is payable one time only, regardless of the number of times the condition is satisfied, and all six payments could be made within the same calendar year. We are also eligible to receive royalties from Bausch and its affiliates based on the following royalty scale: 15% on worldwide net sales up to $100.0 million, 17% on the next $400.0 million in worldwide net sales, and 19% on worldwide net sales over $500.0 million each calendar year, and 60% of any upfront, milestone, reimbursement or other revenue (net of costs of goods sold, as defined, and territory-specific research and development expense reimbursement) Bausch receives from sublicensees outside the U.S.
 
The RELISTOR License Agreement may be terminated by either party upon an uncured material breach or specified bankruptcy events. In addition, Bausch may terminate the RELISTOR License Agreement for unresolved safety or efficacy issues or at its discretion upon specified prior notice at any time, subject to our one-time right to postpone such termination for a specified period of time if we have not successfully transitioned the development and commercialization of the drug despite good faith and diligent efforts. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 
We have licensed to Bausch our exclusive rights to develop and commercialize methylnaltrexone, the active ingredient of RELISTOR, which we in-licensed from the University of Chicago (“UC”). Our agreement with UC provides for an exclusive license to intellectual property in exchange for development and potential commercialization obligations, low single-digit royalties on commercial sales of resulting products and single-digit percentages of milestone and sublicensing revenues, and shared patent policing responsibilities. Under the UC agreement, as amended in connection with our RELISTOR collaborations, all of our royalty payment obligations expired at the end of 2017 in the U.S. and 2018 outside the U.S. on the approved indications.
 
Bausch has also entered into license and distribution agreements to expand its sales channels outside of the U.S. for RELISTOR.

CytoDyn Agreement
 
We sold Leronlimab (PRO 140) to CytoDyn in 2012, which sale included milestone and royalty payment obligations to us. Leronlimab is an investigational humanized IgG4 mAb that blocks CCR5, a cellular receptor that is important in HIV infection, tumor metastases, and other diseases including NASH. CytoDyn has announced its plans to seek FDA approval for Leronlimab in combination therapy for HIV infection and plans to complete the filing of a BLA in the first quarter of 2020 for that indication.
 
Under our 2012 agreement with CytoDyn, CytoDyn is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts. Pursuant to such agreement, we have received $5.0 million in upfront and milestone payments, together with rights to receive an additional $5.0 million upon the first U.S. or E.U. approval for the sale of the drug, and a 5% royalty on the net sales of approved product(s).
 
Patents and Proprietary Technology
 
Protection of our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We seek U.S. patent protection for many of our inventions, and generally file patent applications in Canada, Japan, European countries that are party to the European Patent Convention, and other countries on a selective basis in order to protect inventions we consider to be important to the development of business in those areas. Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for either (i) 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed on or after June 8, 1995, or (ii) the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed prior to that date.
 
In certain instances, the U.S. patent term can be extended up to a maximum of five years to recapture a portion of the term during which FDA regulatory review was being conducted. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law, although most countries provide for patent terms of 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date and allow patent extensions similar to those permitted in the U.S.
 
Patents may not enable us to preclude competitors from commercializing drugs in direct competition with our products, and consequently may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantage. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our product areas. We require our employees, consultants and corporate partners who have access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality agreements.
 
Information with respect to our current patent portfolio is set forth below.
 
The original patents surrounding the AZEDRA program were licensed from the University of Western Ontario (“UWO”). The patent family directed to processes for making polymer precursors, as well as processes for making the final product, expired in 2018 in the U.S. and Canada. The related UWO agreement terminated with the expiration of the patents. Other licensed patent families from UWO under a second agreement relate to alternative approaches for preparing AZEDRA, which if implemented, would expire in 2024 worldwide. We own pending applications worldwide directed to manufacturing improvements and the resulting compositions which, if issued, would expire in 2035.
 
Owned and in-licensed patents relating to 1404 have expiration ranges of 2020 to 2029; we view as most significant the composition-of-matter patent on the compound, as well as technetium-99 labeled forms, which expire in 2029 worldwide.
 
The PyL patent family was licensed from Johns Hopkins University. Patent protection for the composition-of-matter patents on the compound, radiolabeled forms of the compound, as well as methods of use, expire in 2030 in the U.S. Corresponding patent family members are pending or issued worldwide, all expiring in 2029. Process improvement patent applications are pending worldwide which, if issued, would expire in 2037.
 
Company-owned patents relating to 1095 have expiration ranges of 2027 to 2031 in the U.S. We view as most significant the composition-of-matter patent on this compound, as well as radiolabeled forms, which expires in 2027 in the U.S., as well as Europe. Additional U.S. patents are directed to stable compositions and radiolabeling processes which expire in 2030 and 2031, respectively.
 
We own patents relating to automated detection of bone cancer metastases. The patents on this technology expire in 2028 outside of the United States. The U.S. patent under reexamination was issued with an expiration of 2032. Patent applications are pending relating to automated medical image analysis.
 
   10

 

The intellectual property directed to PSMA antibody comprises co-owned and in-licensed patents. Composition-of-matter patents have expirations of 2022 and 2023 in the U.S. Corresponding foreign counterpart patents will expire 2022. We view all of these patents as significant.
 
With regard to our RELISTOR-related intellectual property, the composition-of-matter patent for the active ingredient of RELISTOR, methylnaltrexone, has expired. University of Chicago, as well as we and our collaborators, have extended the methylnaltrexone patent estate with additional patents and pending patent applications covering various inventions relating to the product. Bausch has listed in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the “Orange Book”) eight U.S. patents relating to subcutaneous RELISTOR, which have expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2030, and nine U.S. patents relating to RELISTOR tablet, which have expiration dates ranging from 2029 to 2031. Four Canadian patents (two expiring in 2024, one in 2027 and one in 2029) have been listed with Health Canada relating to subcutaneous RELISTOR.
 
We are aware of intellectual property rights held by third parties that relate to products or technologies we are developing. For example, we are aware of others investigating and developing technologies, imaging agents and drug candidates directed toward PSMA or related compounds as well as in the case of methylnaltrexone, others are developing peripheral opioid antagonists, and of patents and applications held or filed by others in those areas. The validity of issued patents, patentability of claimed inventions in pending applications and applicability of any of them to our programs are uncertain and subject to change, and patent rights asserted against us could adversely affect our ability to commercialize or collaborate with others on specific products.
 
Research, development, and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical product often require choosing between alternative development and optimization routes at various stages in the development process. Preferred routes depend upon current – and may be affected by subsequent – discoveries and test results and cannot be identified with certainty at the outset. There are numerous third-party patents in fields in which we work, and we may need to obtain license under patents of others in order to pursue a preferred development route of one or more of our product candidates. The need to obtain a license would decrease the ultimate value and profitability of an affected product. If we cannot negotiate such a license, we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the entire program altogether.
 
Seasonality
 
As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our business may experience modest seasonality due to patient co-pays and co-insurance being reset at the beginning of the calendar year and patients meeting their deductibles over the course of the calendar year. As a result, demand for RELISTOR and associated revenue may be lower in the beginning of the year.
Government Regulation
 
We and our product candidates are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and comparable authorities in other countries. Pharmaceutical regulation currently is a topic of substantial interest in lawmaking and regulatory bodies in the U.S. and internationally, and numerous proposals exist for changes in FDA and non-U.S. regulation of pre-clinical and clinical testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, marketing, export, advertising, promotion and other aspects of biologics, small molecule drugs and medical devices, many of which, if adopted, could significantly alter our business and the current regulatory structure described below. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 
FDA Regulation
 
FDA approval, which involves review of scientific, clinical and commercial data, manufacturing processes and facilities, is required before a product candidate may be marketed in the U.S. This process is costly, time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays, and a drug candidate may fail to progress at any point.
 
   11

 

Other than AZEDRA and RELISTOR, none of our product candidates have received marketing approval from the FDA or any other regulatory authority. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally involves:
 

● | pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+------------------------------------------


● | submission to and favorable review by the FDA of an investigational new drug application before clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication (animal and other nonclinical studies also are typically conducted during each phase of human clinical trials);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a marketing application; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review of the marketing application in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to gain preliminary information about a compound’s pharmacology and toxicology and to identify safety problems that would preclude testing in humans. Since product candidates must generally be manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), pre-clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices regulations. Pre-clinical testing is preceded by initial research related to specific molecular targets, synthesis of new chemical entities, assay development and screening for identification and optimization of lead compound(s).
 
Results of pre-clinical tests are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may commence. The IND submission must include, among other things, a description of the sponsor’s investigational plan; protocols for each planned study; chemistry, manufacturing and control information; pharmacology and toxicology information and a summary of previous human experience with the investigational drug. Unless the FDA objects to, makes comments or raises questions concerning an IND, it becomes effective 30 days following submission, and initial clinical studies may begin. Companies often obtain affirmative FDA approval, however, before beginning such studies.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to individuals under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice requirements under protocols submitted to the FDA that detail, among other things, the objectives of the trial, parameters used to monitor safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical trial must be conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board, which considers, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects, possible liability of the institution and informed consent disclosure which must be made to participants in the trial.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap. During Phase 1, when the drug is initially administered to human subjects, the product is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 
When a product candidate is found in Phase 2 evaluation to have an effect and an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken in order to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded population. Safety studies are conducted in accordance with the FDA’s International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines. Phase 2 results do not guarantee a similar outcome in Phase 3 trials. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any point in this process if it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
An NDA is an application to the FDA to market a new drug. A BLA is an application to market a biological product. The new drug or biological product may not be marketed in the U.S. until the FDA has approved the NDA or issued a biologics license. The NDA must contain, among other things, information on chemistry, manufacturing and controls; non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology; human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability; and clinical data. The BLA must contain, among other things, data derived from nonclinical laboratory and clinical studies which demonstrate that the product meets prescribed standards of safety, purity and potency, and a full description of manufacturing methods. Supplemental NDAs are submitted to obtain regulatory approval for additional indications for a previously approved drug and are reviewed by the FDA in a similar manner.
 
The results of the pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, the chemistry and manufacturing data, and the proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA. The FDA may refuse to accept the application for filing if certain administrative and content criteria are not satisfied, and even after accepting the application for review, the FDA may require additional testing or information before approval of the application, in either case based upon changes in applicable law or FDA policy during the period of product development and FDA regulatory review. The applicant’s analysis of the results of clinical studies is subject to review and interpretation by the FDA, which may differ from the applicant’s analysis, and in any event, the FDA must deny an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory requirements are not ultimately satisfied. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may be made subject to various conditions, including post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of the product, or may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Product approvals may also be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing.

Orphan Drug, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy Designations, and Priority Review
 
Other FDA regulations and policies relating to drug approval have implications for certain of our current or future product candidates, particularly AZEDRA. Designation as an Orphan Drug is available under U.S., E.U., and other laws for drug candidates intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, and which if approved are granted a period of market exclusivity, subject to various conditions. Orphan Drug designation does not shorten or otherwise convey any advantage in the regulatory approval process. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an Orphan Drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. AZEDRA is designated as an Orphan Drug.
 
In the U.S., Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to certain financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.
 
In cases where the extent and scope of patent protection for a product is limited, the exclusivity period resulting from Orphan Drug designation may be important in helping products maintain a competitive position. Even if a product obtains Orphan Drug exclusivity, however, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may be approved for the same condition. Even after an Orphan Drug is approved, the FDA may subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.
 
The FDA is also authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These mechanisms for expedited review include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. AZEDRA has received fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review designations.
 
The FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 
Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.

Both before and after approval is obtained, a product, its manufacturer and the sponsor of the marketing application for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. Violations of existing or newly-adopted regulatory requirements at any stage, including the pre-clinical and clinical testing process, the approval process, or thereafter, may result in various adverse consequences, including FDA delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, withdrawal of an approved product from the market or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer or sponsor. Later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or sponsor, including withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
Regulation Outside the U.S.

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a pharmaceutical product by comparable government regulatory authorities abroad must be obtained prior to marketing the product there. The approval procedure varies from country to country, and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements for regulatory approval by governmental agencies in other countries prior to commercialization of products there can be rigorous, costly and uncertain, and approvals may not be granted on a timely basis or at all.
 
In E.U. countries, Canada, Australia, and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Regulatory approval in Japan requires that clinical trials of new drugs be conducted in Japanese patients. Depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in E.U. countries: mutual recognition and the centralized procedure. These review mechanisms may ultimately lead to approval in all E.U. countries, but each method grants all participating countries some decision-making authority in product approval. The centralized procedure, which is mandatory for biotechnology derived products, results in a recommendation in all member states, while the E.U. mutual recognition process involves country-by-country approval.
 
In other countries, regulatory requirements may require additional pre-clinical or clinical testing regardless of whether FDA or European approval has been obtained. This is the case in Japan, where trials are required to involve patient populations which we and our other collaborators have not examined in detail. If a product is manufactured in the U.S., it is also subject to FDA and other U.S. export provisions. In most countries outside the U.S., coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required, which may affect the profitability of the affected product.
 
Other Regulation
 
In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to regulation under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, Environmental Protection Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and various other current and potential future U.S. federal, state or local regulations. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our compliance with these regulations during the past year did not have and is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
 
In addition, our research is dependent on maintenance of licenses from various authorities permitting the acquisition, use and storage of quantities of radioactive isotopes that are critical for its manufacture and testing of research products. Biopharmaceutical research and development generally involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses, and various radioactive compounds. Even strict compliance with safety procedures for storing, handling, using and disposing of such materials prescribed by applicable regulations cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contaminations or injury from these materials, which may result in liability for resulting legal and regulatory violations as well as damages.
 
Manufacturing
 
The manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals is complex and requires significant capital expenditures. We have to date engaged third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug products for clinical trial supplies of all of our product candidates, including AZEDRA, PyL and 1095. We acquired the AZEDRA manufacturing assets and entered into a sublease agreement for the radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Somerset, New Jersey. The Somerset site serves as the manufacturing facility for AZEDRA and will also provide manufacturing support for our development stage radiopharmaceuticals, including 1095. We continue to depend significantly on the availability of high quality CMO services for necessary redundancy and additional capacity. If we are unable to arrange for satisfactory CMO services, we would need to undertake such responsibilities on our own, resulting in our having to incur additional expenses and potentially delaying the development of our product candidates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 
   14

 

Under the RELISTOR License Agreement, Bausch is responsible for the manufacture and supply, at its expense, of all API and finished and packaged products for its RELISTOR commercialization efforts, including contracting with CMOs for supply of RELISTOR API and subcutaneous and oral finished drug product.
 
Commercial Organization
 
We have built an experienced radiopharmaceutical team of 12 employees to commercialize AZEDRA in the U.S.
 
Competition
 
Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and characterized by ongoing research and development and technological change. We face competition from many for-profit companies and major universities and research institutions in the U.S. and abroad. We face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products for diseases targeted by our technologies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities and production capabilities than we do. Our products and product candidates under development may not compete successfully with existing products or products under development by other companies, universities and other institutions. Drug manufacturers that are first in the market with a therapeutic for a specific indication generally obtain and maintain a significant competitive advantage over later entrants and therefore, the speed with which industry participants move to develop products, complete clinical trials, approve processes and commercialize products is an important competitive factor.
 
RELISTOR was the first FDA-approved product for any indication involving OIC. We are, however, aware of other approved and marketed products, as well as candidates in pre-clinical or clinical development, that target the side effects of opioid pain therapy. Our principal competitors in the field of OIC include Nektar Therapeutics, in collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC; Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.; and Mallinckrodt plc, in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited; and BioDelivery Sciences International Inc. Other prescription, as well as over-the-counter, laxatives are also used as first line for OIC.
 
As to our oncology pipeline, radiation and surgery are two traditional forms of treatment for prostate cancer. If the disease spreads, hormone (androgen) suppression therapy and chemotherapy are often used to slow the cancer’s progression, but this form of treatment can eventually become ineffective. We are aware of several competitors who are developing or have received approval for treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our principal competitors in the field of mCRPC include Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Biotech, Inc.; Novartis AG and Pfizer, Inc. in collaboration with Astellas Pharma US, Inc.; and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and Telix Pharmaceuticals. Our principal competitors in the field of prostate cancer imaging agents include Aytu Bioscience Inc., Bracco Diagnostics, Inc., Novartis AG and Telix Pharmaceuticals.
 
Other than AZEDRA, there are currently no approved anticancer treatments in the U.S. for malignant, recurrent, and/or unresectable pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.
 
A significant amount of research in the biopharmaceutical field is carried out at academic and government institutions. An element of our research and development strategy has been to in-license technology and product candidates from academic and government institutions. These institutions are sensitive to the commercial value of their findings and pursue patent protection and negotiate licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology they develop. They may also market competitive commercial products on their own or in collaboration with competitors and compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel, which may result in increased costs or decreased availability of technology or product candidates from these institutions to other industry participants.
 
Competition with respect to our technologies and products is based on, among other things, product efficacy, safety, reliability, method of administration, availability, price and clinical benefit relative to cost; timing and scope of regulatory approval; sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; collaborator capabilities; insurance and other reimbursement coverage; and patent protection. Competitive position in our industry also depends on a participant’s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and secure sufficient capital resources for the typically substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales.

Product Liability
 
The testing, manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates and products involves an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects. To the extent we elect to test, manufacture or market product candidates and products independently, we bear the risk of product liability directly. We maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts and pursuant to terms and conditions customary for our industry, scale, and the nature of our activities. Where local statutory requirements exceed the limits of our existing insurance or local policies of insurance are required, we maintain additional clinical trial liability insurance to meet these requirements. This insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. The availability and cost of maintaining insurance may change over time. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 
Human Resources
 
At December 31, 2019, we had 105 full-time employees, 23 of whom hold Ph.D./PharmD degrees and three of whom hold M.D. degrees. At that date, 72 employees were engaged in research and development, medical, regulatory affairs, and manufacturing related activities and 33 were engaged in finance, legal, administration, commercial, and business development. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
