  History
  
 Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc.  ("NTH" or “Tongji Hospital”) was established in Nanning, Guangxi province of the People’s Republic of China ("PRC") by Nanning Tongji Medical Co. Ltd. and an individual on October 30, 2003.
  
 NTH is an assigned hospital for medical insurance in both the city of Nanning and the province of Guangxi. NTH specializes in the areas of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health examination, and prevention.
  
 On December 19, 2006, the officers of NTH established Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), and Tongji, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Tongji"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company was authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock both with a par value of $0.001.
  
 On December 27, 2006, Tongji acquired 100% of the equity in NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger. The Company issued 15,652,557 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NTH. Accordingly, NTH became the wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji.   
  
 In March, 2011, Tongji was dissolved pursuant to the laws of Colorado. Unless otherwise provided, references to the “Company” shall hereinafter include the Company and NTH.

  Corporate Structure
  
 Our present corporate structure is as follows:
  
 
  Our Business
  
 We operate Tongji Hospital, a general hospital with 105 licensed beds. Tongji Hospital offers care and treatment in the areas of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health examination, prevention, and emergency care. Our emergency room is open 24 hours a day and all of our rooms are air conditioned.
  
 Tongji Hospital is certified as a provider of Medicare services by the Nanning municipal government and the Guangxi provincial government. Our Medicare agreements with the Nanning municipal government and the Guangxi provincial government require that we adhere to prescribed standards for patient care and treatment. Maintaining the qualifications for acceptance of Medicare patients is very important as revenue from Medicare patients accounted for 59% of total hospital income in 2016. The Medicare accreditation is valid for only one year and must be renewed on an annual basis.
  
 Because we maintain a facility in excess of 100 beds, we must register with and maintain an operating license from the local Administration of Health. We are subjected to review by the local Administration of Health at least once every three years. If we fail to meet their standards, our license may be revoked. We are also obligated to provide free services or dispatch our physicians or employees in the event of a need for public assistance. Currently, we dedicate a very small percentage of our resources to providing free public services.
  
 As is common in China, we generate revenues from providing both medical treatment and the sale of drugs and medications. Approximately 1.5% of the drugs and medications we use in the hospital and sell to our patients in 2016 are purchased from Guangxi Tongji Medicine Co., Ltd., a related company controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, Yunhui Yu, at prevailing market prices pursuant to a supply contract. The rest are from around 22 different suppliers, three of which collectively accounted for more than 85% of our total purchases in 2016.
  
 We generate revenues from individuals as well as third-party payers, including PRC government programs and insurance providers, under which the hospital is paid based upon several methodologies including established charges, the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from established charges. Revenues are recorded at net amounts due from patients, third-party payers and others for healthcare services provided at the time the service is provided. Revenues from pharmaceutical drug sales are recognized upon the drug being administered to a patient or at the time a prescription is filled for a patient with an executed prescription slip by a registered physician.

  Item 1.            Business - continued
  
 Revenues are recorded at net amounts due from patients and government Medicare funds. The Company's accounting system calculates the expected amounts payable by the government Medicare funds. The Company bills for services provided to Medicare patients through a medical card (the US equivalent of an insurance card). The Company normally receives 90% of the billed amount within 90 days with the remaining 10% upon the Company’s reconciliation by the end of the year. Historically, there have been no significant differences between the amounts the Company bills the government Medicare funds and the amounts collected from the Medicare funds.
  
 Some differences exist in the Medical System between the U.S. and China. In the United States, most hospitals have contracts with health insurance companies which provide that patients with health insurance will be charged reduced rates for healthcare services. Reduced rates are also charged for Medicare and Medicaid patients. Although the patient is billed for the services provided by the hospital at the higher rate normally charged to patients without insurance, the amount billed is reduced by the charges paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference (sometimes known as the "contractual allowance") between the normal rate for the services and the reduced rate which the hospital estimates it will receive from Medicare, Medicaid and insurance companies.
  
 For financial reporting purposes, hospitals in the United States record revenues based on established billing rates less adjustments for contractual allowances. Revenues are recorded based on the amounts due from the patients and third-party payers, including federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs) managed care health plans, health insurance companies, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under third-party payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Third-party payer contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, or discounted fee-for-service rates.
  
 Due to the complexities involved in determining the amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of third-party payers, which are often subject to interpretation, the reimbursement actually received by U.S. hospitals for health care services is sometimes different from their estimates.
  
 In contrast, private medical insurance is not generally available to the Chinese population and as a result services and medications provided by our hospital are usually paid for in cash or by the Medicare agencies of the Nanning municipal government and the Guangxi provincial government. Our billing system automatically calculates the reimbursements to which we are entitled based on regulations promulgated by the Medicare agencies. We bill the Medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients covered by the Medicare programs. Since we bill the Medicare agencies directly, our gross revenues are not reduced by contractual allowances.
  
 We only deal with the Nanning municipal and the Guangxi provincial Medicare agencies, and we are familiar with their regulations pertaining to reimbursements. As a result, there is normally no material difference between the amounts we bill and the amounts we receive for services provided to Medicare patients.
  
 In March 2016, Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. sold its construction in progress hospital building to Guangxi Yida Friendship Hospital Management, Inc. for RMB 86,000,000 (approximately $13,000,000). The hospital building is being constructed by Guangxi Construction Engineering Corporation Langdong 8th Group (“Langdong 8th Group”). Costs capitalized primarily consists of payments for construction costs, acquisition cost, land rights cost, development expenditure, professional fees, and capitalized interest. As of the date of disposal, we had accrued approximately $15,000,000 for the construction of the hospital. As a result of the sale, we increased the other receivables to approximately $13,000,000. Concurrently, the remaining balance results in an extraordinary loss in the approximate amount of $2,000,000 in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we received payment of approximately $5,400,000. We incurred value-added tax (VAT) and other taxes liability of RMB 4,530,000 (approximately $682,227) related to this transaction. The amount is included in other payables.
  
 We plan to acquire other hospitals and companies involved in the healthcare industry in the PRC using cash and shares of our common stock. Substantial capital may be needed for these acquisitions and we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of our common stock, debt financing or other arrangements. We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any additional capital. Additional capital may not be available to us, or if available, on acceptable terms, in which case we would not be able to acquire other hospitals or businesses in the healthcare industry.

  Regulations pertaining to our Business
  
 According to the PRC Regulation of Healthcare Institutions, hospitals shall register with the Administration of Health of the local government to obtain the necessary business license for the provision of hospital services. We received our renewed business license from Nanning City government in November of 2007, and this license is valid until November, 2020. Other existing regulations having material effects on our business include those dealing with physician's licensing, usage of medicine and injection, public security in health and medical advertising.
 Customers
  
 The Company had three major customers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Nanning Social Insurance Center, Guangxi Province Social Insurance Center, and China UMS. Nanning Social Insurance Center accounted for 49% and 36% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Guangxi Province Social Insurance Center accounted for 10% and 5% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. China UMS accounted for 12% and 15% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Suppliers
  
 The Company purchases the majority of its medicine supplies from three suppliers which collectively accounted for more than 85% of our total purchases in 2016. The rest are from around 22 different suppliers. One of the suppliers, Guangxi Tongji Medicine Co. Ltd., is a related company that our Chief Executive Officer controls and accounted for 1.5% of our total purchases in 2016.
 Competition
  
 We compete with eleven government-owned hospitals and three privately owned hospitals in the city of Nanning. We believe that we will be able to effectively compete with them because we:
  
 ·           Provide advanced medical facilities and a comfortable environment for our patients
  ·           Maintain the highest level of professional healthcare
  ·           Offer competitive prices for medical treatment and drugs and medications.
   
  Marketing
  
 To increase our visibility we built several “Tongji Hospital” signs at locations near our hospital and some busy streets in Nanning city. We also send out our experts and medical team to communities to provide free public services including consultation and medical services to attract customers.  Some other marketing activities include media advertising, holiday promotions, telephone services, and reduced fees.
  
 In the future we plan to further strengthen our marketing efforts and improve our brand awareness through advertising in newspapers, magazines and on television. We will continue to focus on community medical service by maintaining good relationships with our communities, and providing quality medical service to the neighborhood residents. We will set up our marketing department and team to focus on specific market and patients. We understand that the key to success is to provide quality services. Marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 are approximately $2,000. Budgeted marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 are approximately $9,000 in an effort to improve our brand awareness.

 In addition, companies in the PRC are required to pay business taxes consisting of 5% of revenue from providing medical treatment, and city construction taxes and educational taxes of 7% and 3%, respectively of the business taxes. The Company was granted an exemption from the local tax bureau from these taxes in April 2010. The tax exempt status will remain effective until notification from the tax bureau.
  
 The Company does not accrue United States income taxes on unremitted earnings from foreign operations, as it is the Company’s intention to invest these earnings in the foreign operations indefinitely. However, the Company may be subject to penalties of approximately $40,000 for failure to file United States income tax returns and Form 5472 from 2006 to 2009.

 In accordance with current Chinese laws, regulations and accounting standards, we are required to set aside as a general reserve at least 10% of our after-tax profits.

We are also required to set aside between 5% to 10% of our after-tax profits to the statutory public welfare reserve. In addition, at the discretion of our directors, we may set aside a portion of our after-tax profits for enterprise expansion funds, staff welfare and bonus funds and a surplus reserve.
