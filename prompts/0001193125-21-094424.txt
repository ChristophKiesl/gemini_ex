Index to Financial Statements
   Our lead product candidate, seladelpar, is a potent and selective agonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARd), a nuclear receptor that regulates genes directly or indirectly involved in the synthesis of bile acids/sterols, metabolism of lipids and glucose, inflammation and fibrosis. We have been developing seladelpar for the treatment of liver diseases including: 

• | primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), an autoimmune disease that causes progressive destruction of the bile ducts in the liver resulting in impaired bile flow (cholestasis) and inflammation; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a prevalent and serious chronic liver disease caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver that results in inflammation and cellular injury that can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis, and potentially liver failure and death.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We reported net losses of approximately $51.0 million, $102.8 million, and $72.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $146.3 million, which we believe is sufficient to fund our current operating plan into mid-2022.
Strategy

   Seladelpar (MBX-8025)
Summary 
 Seladelpar is a selective agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd). The PPARd receptor is a nuclear receptor that regulates genes involved in bile acid/sterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism, and regulation of certain inflammatory cells. Seladelpar has the potential to treat certain diseases of the liver and a variety of disorders of lipid metabolism. 
 Seladelpar was initially developed for treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, which is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs). Results from our Phase 2 clinical study of seladelpar in patients with mixed dyslipidemia established effects that we believe have the potential to benefit patients affected with PBC and other conditions. These benefits include: 
 

• | Lowered LDL-C and total cholesterol, and raised high-density-lipoprotein (HDL-C),
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decreased triglycerides and free fatty acids,
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Decreases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of inflammation, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant reductions in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In February 2019, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted seladelpar Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of early stage PBC, and in October 2016, seladelpar received the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation for the treatment of PBC. In November 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to seladelpar for the treatment of PBC. In September 2017, EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) granted orphan drug designation to seladelpar for the treatment of PBC. 
 To date, we have completed six-month and twelve-month toxicity studies of seladelpar in rats and monkeys, respectively, as well as two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats. In addition, we have completed multiple Phase 1 clinical studies and three Phase 2 and one Phase 3 clinical study (ENHANCE) of seladelpar in PBC. In addition, we are in the process of commencing a second Phase 3 study (RESPONSE) with seladelpar. We believe that the data from the Phase 2 studies and the ENHANCE Phase 3 study established seladelpar’s anti-cholestatic and anti-inflammatory effects and identified a dose that has the potential to offer patients improved efficacy and better tolerability over the only approved second-line treatment available today. Those studies showed reductions in markers of cholestasis including ALP and GGT, and showed that seladelpar also improved inflammatory and metabolic markers with patients experiencing decreases in levels of transaminases, hs-CRP, and LDL-C. Many PBC patients suffer from pruritus, or itching, which can significantly impact their quality of life. Based on data from our Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, and unlike the only approved second-line treatment currently available, we believe that seladelpar may reduce the incidence of pruritus in PBC patients. 
 Target Indications for Seladelpar 
 We are actively pursuing PBC as our initial launch indication for seladelpar. Other indications, such as NASH, will be pursued opportunistically. Following is a review of PBC and NASH and our development progress in each indication. 
Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) 
 Summary 
 PBC is a rare, chronic progressive autoimmune liver disease that predominantly affects middle-aged women. A T-cell mediated immune response is thought to damage, and ultimately destroy, the interlobular and septal bile ducts. The loss of bile duct function leads to decreased bile secretion and retention of toxic substances, including bile acids, within the liver parenchyma. This retention may ultimately cause liver cirrhosis and liver failure in PBC patients.

Index to Financial Statements
   PBC primarily affects an estimated one in 1,000 women over the age of 40. Due to its low prevalence, PBC has been recognized as an orphan disease in the U.S. and E.U., meeting their respective FDA and EMA orphan designation criteria. Diagnosis of PBC is confirmed by elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) presence and/or magnitude of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA presence), and liver biopsies, although biopsies are no longer required for diagnosis in most patients. 
 The most common clinical symptoms of PBC include fatigue and pruritus, or itching (up to 70% occurrence), which adversely affects many patients’ quality of life. PBC patients are also frequently affected by conditions including jaundice, hyperlipidemia (notably hypercholesterolemia), hypothyroidism, osteopenia and osteoporosis, and coexisting autoimmune diseases. Late complications of PBC include portal hypertension, malabsorption, deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, and steatorrhea (excess fat in feces). Left untreated, PBC disease progression can lead to the need for liver transplantation and liver-related mortality. Despite being a rare disease, PBC is one of the top six indications for liver transplantation in the U.S. and E.U. Recurrence of PBC following liver transplantation is reported in 11-46% of transplantations, with an estimated prevalence of 30% at 10 years following transplantation, further demonstrating a need for effective therapies. 
 Retrospective analyses of PBC clinical outcomes data have shown that elevated levels of ALP and bilirubin are associated with worsened clinical outcomes including liver transplantation and death associated with PBC. These analyses supported the use of ALP and bilirubin as elements of a clinical surrogate reasonably likely to predict outcomes that was used for the approval of obeticholic acid as a second line therapy for PBC. 
 Competition/Industry 
 We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The FDA-approved treatments for PBC are ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also known as ursodiol, a generic drug, and obeticholic acid (Ocaliva®, marketed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc). UDCA is a natural bile acid that decreases serum levels of ALP, bilirubin, alanine transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, cholesterol, and immunoglobulin M, which are all elevated in patients with PBC and can serve as biochemical markers of disease. Ocaliva® is a synthetic bile acid analog that binds to and activates the farnesoid X receptor, or FXR, and received orphan designations in the U.S. and the E.U. Elafibranor (Genfit S.A.) is a mixed PPARa/d agonist in development for patients with PBC. In April 2019, Genfit announced elafibranor had been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of PBC. In December 2018, Genfit announced Phase 2 results from a Phase 2 study of elafibranor in PBC and in September 2020, announced the commencement of a Phase 3 study of elafibranor in PBC. Saroglitazar (Zydus Cadila) is a dual PPARa/g agonist in development for patients with PBC. In November 2020, Zydus presented data from a Phase 2 study evaluating saroglitazar in patients with PBC at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and in December 2020, Zydus announced saroglitazar had received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of PBC and in January 2021 it received Orphan Drug Designation for PBC from the FDA. Phase 2 study data in patients with PBC has been reported for the selective NOX inhibitor GKT137831 (Calliditas) along with the announced intention to conduct a Phase 2/3 study in the second half of 2021. 
 Studies of Seladelpar in PBC 
 RESPONSE (Phase 3) 
 We are currently in the process of commencing enrollment in a global, Phase 3 registration study (RESPONSE) to evaluate seladelpar in patients with PBC. The Phase 3 study is a 52-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, global, registration study evaluating the safety and efficacy of seladelpar in patients with PBC. The study is intended to enroll 180 patients, who have an inadequate response to, or intolerance to, ursodeoxycholic acid, in a 2:1 randomization to oral, once daily seladelpar 10 mg or placebo. The primary outcome measure will be the composite biochemical responder rate at 52 weeks. A responder is defined as a patient who achieves an ALP level less than 1.67 times the upper limit of normal with at least a 15%

   decrease from baseline and has a normal level of total bilirubin. Additional key outcomes of efficacy will compare the rate of normalization of ALP at 52 weeks and the change from baseline in level of pruritus at six months for patients with moderate to severe pruritus at baseline assessed by a numerical rating scale (NRS) recorded with an electronic diary. 
 ENHANCE (Phase 3) 
 In October 2018 we commenced a global, Phase 3 registration study (ENHANCE) to evaluate seladelpar in patients with PBC. The Phase 3 study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 52-week study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 5 mg and 10 mg of seladelpar versus placebo in patients with PBC who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to first-line treatment with UDCA. 
 Approximately 265 patients were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg of seladelpar, or 10 mg of seladelpar. Patients on 5 mg could potentially increase their dose, in a double-blinded manner, to 10 mg after 6 months if they have not yet met the composite biochemical response criteria. The primary endpoint was a composite response defined as a patient achieving an ALP level below 1.67 times the upper limit of normal, with at least a 15% reduction from baseline, and a normal total bilirubin at 52 weeks. The primary efficacy analysis was to compare response rates of treatment groups to those of the placebo group. Key secondary endpoints were to be ALP normalization rate and changes from baseline in pruritus, as measured by the numerical rating scale, or NRS in patients with moderate to severe pruritus at baseline. 
 In December 2019 we terminated ENHANCE early based on initial histological observations obtained in our Phase 2b study of seladelpar in NASH. In May 2020, we announced completion of an independent expert panel review into the NASH findings that concluded the data, in aggregate, did not support liver injury related to seladelpar. In June 2020, we discussed the data, the panel’s conclusions, and other matters with the FDA. In July 2020, the FDA lifted the clinical hold on the program and we made the decision to reinstate clinical development of seladelpar in PBC. 
 In August 2020 we announced positive results from ENHANCE, which we believe demonstrated seladelpar to be safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious in patients with PBC. Although the study was terminated prior to the completion of the 52-week treatment period, the statistical analysis plan was amended while the study remained blinded to adjust for evaluation of the primary and two key secondary endpoints at Week 12 rather than Week 52. Topline data for patients through 12 and to 26 weeks showed what we believe to be robust anti-cholestatic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic activity of seladelpar. Specifically, 78.2% of patients on 10 mg of seladelpar compared with 12.5% on placebo achieved the primary composite outcome after 3 months (p<0.0001), and 27.3% of patients on 10 mg of seladelpar compared with 0% on placebo normalized ALP by 3 months (p<0.0001). In addition, the study revealed statistically significant improvement in change from baseline in pruritus at 3 months (p<0.05) for patients with moderate-to-severe itch treated with seladelpar 10 mg versus placebo. 
 Safety Studies 
 Prior to the decision to terminate in December 2019, we were conducting a long-term safety study of seladelpar, which was open to patients who had participated in other company-sponsored PBC studies. Patients completing the Phase 2 open label study discussed immediately below, as well as ENHANCE, were able to transfer into the long-term safety study. As of the time of termination, 106 patients had received seladelpar for at least 12 months and 51 patients had received seladelpar for at least 24 months. The safety study was discontinued due to the histological observations in the Phase 2b NASH study. 
 With the reinstatement of the clinical development of seladelpar we recently commenced a long-term safety study (ASSURE), which is open to patients who were eligible for the prior long-term extension study, including those from our Phase 2 open label study and our Phase 3 ENHANCE study, as well as patients completing treatment in RESPONSE.

   Phase 2 Open Label Study 
 In December 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 study of seladelpar in patients with PBC. The study was an open label, randomized, dose-ranging study evaluating 2 mg, 5 mg and 10mg doses of seladelpar and the primary efficacy endpoint was percent change in ALP from baseline. The study had an initial twelve-week period in which starting doses were maintained, but after which doses could be increased to as high as 10 mg for those patients in which a greater biochemical response was deemed appropriate, these being described as titration groups. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate other markers of cholestasis, inflammation, and lipid parameters, as well as clinical symptoms such as pruritus and quality of life. 
 In November 2018 we announced data that we believe showed that seladelpar treatment led to sustained anti-cholestatic and anti-inflammatory effects with no worsening of pruritus through 52 weeks. Specifically, at 52 weeks the mean decreases in ALP were -47% and -46% in the 5/10 titration and 10 mg groups, respectively. A key secondary outcome was the composite response measured at week 52 where a responder was defined as a patient with ALP <1.67 x ULN, ³15% decrease in ALP, and total bilirubin £ULN. At 52 weeks 59% and 71% of patients met the composite endpoint in the 5/10 titration and 10 mg groups, respectively. The anti-cholestatic effect of seladelpar was further substantiated with normalization of ALP levels at 52 weeks in 24% and 29% of patients in the 5/10 titration and 10 mg groups, respectively. Treatment with seladelpar also demonstrated a robust anti-inflammatory activity with median transaminase decreases of -31% and -33% in the 5/10 titration and 10 mg groups, respectively. 
 A 52-week analysis from the study was also shared on the effect of seladelpar on pruritus, or itching, which is a common clinical symptom of PBC that adversely effects a patient’s quality of life. Patient self-reported experiences were collected using the pruritus visual analogue scale (VAS) in 101 PBC patients in the 5/10 titration or 10 mg groups. In patients with moderate to severe pruritus (VAS ³ 40), substantial improvement in pruritus (VAS ³ 20-point decrease) was seen in 58% and 93% of patients in the 5/10 titration and 10 mg groups, respectively. These data suggest that seladelpar is not associated with drug-induced pruritus and support further evaluation of seladelpar’s potential benefit on pruritus. 
 Of the 119 patients that received at least one dose of seladelpar (2, 5 or 10 mg), 11 serious adverse events were documented, and none were considered related to seladelpar. Three patients discontinued seladelpar, of which only one discontinuation, for a grade 1 gastroesophageal reflux, was deemed related to seladelpar. There was no transaminase safety signal, and importantly, there was no indication that seladelpar was associated with drug-induced pruritus. 
 Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) 
 Summary 
 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and encompasses a spectrum of conditions that arise from fat accumulation in the liver of individuals that cannot otherwise be attributed to alcohol consumption. The prevalence of NAFLD has increased and is reported to account for approximately 25% of the general population worldwide. It is widely believed that the increase in NAFLD prevalence is a consequence of the obesity epidemic, and studies associate NAFLD with visceral obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. 
 The accumulation of fat in combination with hepatic inflammation can cause chronic liver injury leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of NAFLD and increases patient risk of developing advanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, the need for liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and/or death. Serum markers that are often elevated in NASH patients include the transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Liver biopsies are performed to confirm a NASH diagnosis. Approximately 10-20% of individuals with NAFLD progress to NASH.

   Competition/Industry 
 There are currently no drugs approved in the U.S. or E.U. for the treatment of NASH. In September 2019, Intercept Pharmaceuticals filed a New Drug Application with the FDA for obeticholic acid (Ocaliva®), an FXR-agonist, in patients with fibrosis due to NASH. Several clinical studies have been completed or are underway with drug candidates that may affect disease outcomes in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH, including Phase 3 studies with Ocaliva®, cenicriviroc, a CCR2/5 receptor antagonist (Abbvie), and Resmitiron, a THRb agonist (Madrigal). Novo Nordisk is also planning to start a Phase 3 study in NASH in 2021 with semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. In addition, over two dozen other compounds are currently in Phase 2 development in NASH. 
 Studies of Seladelpar in NASH 
 Phase 2b NASH Study 
 In May 2018, we initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-ranging Phase 2b study to evaluate seladelpar in patients with NASH. In February 2019, we announced full enrollment of 181 patients with liver biopsy proven NASH at specialized U.S. investigational centers. Seladelpar at doses of 10, 20, and 50 mg per day were studied versus placebo in a 2:2:2:1 randomization. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline in liver fat content at 12 weeks as measured by magnetic resonance imaging using the proton density fat fraction method (MRI-PDFF). In June 2019, we announced results from the primary efficacy outcome, which were that treatment with seladelpar resulted in significant reductions in liver fat but that these changes were not significant when compared to placebo, which also had significant reductions. Treatment with seladelpar did, however, result in robust and clinically meaningful reductions in markers associated with liver injury. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) declined up to 37.5% or 32 U/L in 12 weeks. These reductions in ALT are significantly greater than the 17 U/L threshold that has been correlated with histologic improvement in NASH. Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) also decreased significantly, suggesting a reduction in hepatocellular oxidative stress. Significant reductions in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 12 weeks were observed, supportive of a decrease in hepatocellular bile acids. The marked changes in these liver enzymes collectively suggested the potential to impact ballooning and lobular inflammation, the two key components of NASH resolution. In November 2019, we announced that this trial was terminated based on initial histological observations. Although these patients had stable or improving biochemical markers of liver disease, we halted dosing of patients with seladelpar due to the lack of understanding the significance of the observations, and possible impact on patients. 
 In March 2020, we announced additional preliminary data from the terminated Phase 2b study of seladelpar in patients with NASH. For liver tests at 52 weeks, there were 19, 35, 41 and 40 evaluable patients in the placebo, 10, 20 and 50 mg groups, respectively. The corresponding percent changes from baseline at week 52 in ALT were +1.1%, -29.1%, -41.9% and -41.3%. Similarly for AST, relative changes at week 52 were -0.5%, -19.7%, -25.0%, and -16.6% percent for placebo, 10, 20 and 50 mg, respectively. Finally, corresponding changes in GGT were -0.6%, -29.0%, -46.1% and -35.0%. Out of 181 patients enrolled in the study, there were 152 with paired biopsies at entry and end-of-treatment. The number of patients with paired biopsies in the placebo, 10, 20 and 50 mg seladelpar groups were 25, 39, 42 and 46, respectively. The proportion of responders with resolution of NASH with no worsening in fibrosis were 8.0%, 10.3%, 19.0% and 26.1% in the placebo, 10, 20 and 50 mg seladelpar groups, respectively. The corresponding responder rates for at least a one stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening in NASH were 20.0%, 23.1%, 23.8% and 37.0%. The proportion of patients meeting both endpoints were 8.0%, 5.1%, 11.9% and 19.6% for the placebo, 10, 20 and 50 mg seladelpar groups, respectively. 
 Pre-clinical Studies 
 The mode of action for seladelpar in NASH was established in a diabetic and dyslipidemic obese mouse model (the foz/foz mouse model; Haczeyni et al., 2017). These mice develop liver pathology similar to humans with NASH consisting of steatohepatitis complicated by pericellular fibrosis (Van Rooyen et al., 2011; Haczeyni et al., 2015). The pathogenic progression of NASH and seladelpar’s actions in this model are broadly 
 
10 

Index to Financial Statements
   summarized as follows: (1) The accumulation of fat with an accompanying development of insulin resistance: seladelpar reduced hepatic steatosis by increasing expression of genes associated with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, which was accompanied by restoration of full insulin sensitivity; (2) Cell stress and injury response: seladelpar reduced hepatocellular toxic species, including lipotoxic lipids and free cholesterol, with strong reductions in apoptosis and cell regeneration response to injury. There was a complete abrogation of cellular ballooning (necroinflammation), which is a defining characteristic of NASH; (3) Initiation and perpetuation of inflammation: seladelpar treatment led to strong reductions in liver macrophages, which was accompanied by reductions in inflammatory mediators; (4) Extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling: seladelpar reduced collagen deposition and characteristic fibrogenic transcripts that accompany stellate cell activation and fibrosis. 
 We have also confirmed many of the features of the mechanism of seladelpar for NASH in a second mouse model, a diet-induced biopsy-confirmed NASH model in obese mice (Choi et al., 2018). This independent model employed feeding mice a diet with high levels of trans-fat, fructose and cholesterol to create a more aggressive NASH with fibrosis. Reduction in hepatic fat and improvement in NASH pathology, including abrogation of ballooning, were also observed. Fibrosis was reduced as measured by total collagen content in the liver. 
NASH Histology Review 
 In November 2019, we announced the termination of our Phase 2b study of seladelpar in subjects with NASH. In addition, we placed on hold all studies of seladelpar in subjects with PBC. The decision to halt development of seladelpar was based on initial histological observations in the Phase 2b study of seladelpar in NASH that were observed in the first blinded tranche of liver biopsies in the trial. These observations were characterized by an interface hepatitis presentation, with or without biliary injury, and sometimes with the presence of numerous immune cells. Although these patients had stable or improving biochemical markers of liver disease, the decision to halt development was based on a need to understand the significance of the observations, and possible impact on patients, before dosing additional patients with seladelpar. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreed with this decision and subsequently placed a formal clinical hold on seladelpar in December 2019. Thereafter, we terminated all our ongoing clinical studies of seladelpar pending further investigation of the histological observations. 
 With the receipt of additional requests from the FDA, we initiated a series of investigative actions to better understand the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in our Phase 2b NASH study and the histological observations identified by our study pathologists at the end of treatment. The investigation included three activities intended to confirm and subsequently understand the significance of the observations. The first was a comprehensive collection and review of data including patient demographics, medical history, concomitant medications and additional biochemical markers. The second was a blinded, independent review of baseline and end of treatment biopsies by several experienced liver pathologists. Finally, the third, was a formal pathology and clinical hepatology review panel meeting during which experts reviewed all information gathered to provide a consensus independent determination of the role of seladelpar in these findings. These activities were essential to our follow-up with the FDA and to determine if there was a path forward for seladelpar. 
 In May 2020, we announced completion of an independent expert panel review into the findings from our NASH Phase 2b study. The eight-person panel included three hepatopathologists and five hepatologists with expertise in drug-induced liver injury, NASH and PBC. The expert panel found no clinical, biochemical or histological evidence of seladelpar-related liver injury in the study. The panel also unanimously supported lifting of the clinical hold and the re-initiation of clinical development. In June 2020, we discussed the data, the panel’s conclusions, and other matters with the FDA and submitted a complete response letter to answer outstanding FDA questions and seek approval from the FDA to lift the clinical hold. In July 2020, we received a response from the FDA lifting the clinical hold, thereby permitting us to reinstate clinical development of seladelpar.

   MBX-2982
MBX-2982 targets G protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119), a receptor that interacts with bioactive lipids known to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Preclinical data indicate that MBX-2982 is a potent selective orally-active GPR119 agonist that functions through a unique dual mechanism of action that acts directly on the beta cell to increase insulin secretion and stimulates release of the incretin GLP-1 from the gut. We have previously conducted clinical studies for MBX-2982 as a potential treatment for diabetes, demonstrating MBX-2982 was, we believe, safe and well tolerated. 
 We believe MBX-2982 may also have utility in various diseases impacting the gut, liver or gut-liver axis and are currently exploring potential opportunities to advance development. 
 In November 2020, we announced a study to evaluate the potential for MBX-2982 to stimulate the release of the hormone glucagon in response to hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Glucagon is a regulatory hormone that elevates blood sugar levels in response to below normal glucose levels (hypoglycemia). Insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetes is a significant limiting factor in achieving the desired glucose control and is the cause of significant morbidity. In recent preclinical studies, GPR119 agonists were shown to enhance glucagon secretion in response to low glucose levels and were able to prevent hypoglycemia in animal models. The Phase 2a proof-of-pharmacology study will assess whether MBX-2982 can enhance glucagon secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in subjects with T1D. If successful, studies to evaluate MBX-2982 as a potential preventive therapy for hypoglycemia in patients with T1D may be warranted. The study is being led by the AdventHealth Translational Research Institute in Orlando, Florida and is fully funded by The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. CymaBay retains full commercial rights to MBX-2982.
CB-0406
In 2020, we began to evaluate CB-0406, the active metabolite of the pro-drug arhalofenate that had previously been studied for chronic metabolic diseases. We initiated a single and multiple ascending dose study of CB-0406 in healthy subjects to establish its pharmacokinetics, safety and maximum tolerated dose. CB-0406 is a PPARg non-agonist ligand that attenuates the expression of inflammatory genes. It has been shown to block innate immune responses to inflammatory triggers in macrophages, and to attenuate gouty inflammation when dosed as the pro-drug in mouse animal models and in a Phase 2 clinical study in gout patients. Based on pharmacokinetic studies in monkeys, we believe that CB-0406 may have greater exposure and potentially greater efficacy than does the pro-drug arhalofenate. Decisions on any future development are contingent on it achieving a favorable profile with respect to safety and exposure. The innate immune system plays a pivotal role in many diseases besides gout and thus we believe CB-0406 may have utility in various inflammatory diseases and are currently exploring potential opportunities to advance its development pending the results of the ongoing Phase 1 study. 
 CB-001 (GPR120) 
 CB-001 targets G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), a receptor for omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Pharmacodynamic effects include insulin sensitization, stimulation of GLP-1 release, glucose sensitive insulin secretion (GSIS), improvement in hepatic steatosis and lipid profile, and anti-inflammatory activity. Preclinical target validation has been achieved. 
 We believe CB-001 may have utility in various diseases impacting the gut, liver or gut-liver axis and are currently exploring potential opportunities to advance development. 
 Restructuring Plan 
 Following the announcement of the histological observations obtained in our NASH Phase 2 study in November 2019 and the subsequent termination of our ongoing seladelpar clinical trials in November and

Index to Financial Statements
   December 2019, we announced a restructuring plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 60% to control our operating costs, and we commenced a process to evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. Following the FDA’s decision in July 2020 to lift the clinical hold on the seladelpar program, we subsequently concluded our formal review of strategic options, having made the determination to restart clinical development of seladelpar in PBC and to conduct other drug development activities. Specifically, we made the strategic decision to refocus our strategy primarily on clinical development of seladelpar in PBC and to explore the potential to partner seladelpar in NASH in a combination study with other complimentary agents. In addition, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities to develop other internal programs and possibly acquire or in-license new compounds or programs. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the global novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. Through the date of filing of this Annual Report, our operations, financial condition and liquidity have not been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience future disruptions that could impact aspects of our business, including our progress towards the completion of our clinical studies, and other associated drug development activities. Possible disruptions are currently difficult to foresee. We continue to monitor areas of potential risk which include but are not limited to the following: 

• | Remote workforce operations. To date, our workforce has adapted to remotely working to maintain operations. Our reliance on personnel working from home could potentially negatively impact future productivity, or disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, remote operations could increase our cyber-security and data privacy risks, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations, or delay necessary interactions with regulators, contract manufacturers, contract research organizations, clinical trial sites, and other important agencies and contractors, which may result in increased costs to us.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical trial and drug manufacturing operations. In collaboration with our clinical research organization partners, we sponsor clinical trials that take place at investigator sites in the United States and internationally. We also partner with contract manufacturing organizations to develop, manufacture, and distribute our product candidate drug supplies. To date, these collective research and development personnel and vendors are adapting to COVID-19 related travel restrictions and reduced access to work facilities through the use of remote working technologies and other measures as they continue to progress toward enrollment and completion of our existing clinical trials. However, in the future, as we look to enroll and complete the clinical development of seladelpar and initiate other programs, our research and development employees and contractors may not be able to sufficiently access their applicable work facilities as a result of continued facility closure orders and the possibility that governmental authorities might further modify such restrictions. Furthermore, patients we expect to enroll in our clinical trials may also be impacted by any ongoing travel and facility access restrictions. Although we and our contractors continue to plan for and develop pandemic-related risk mitigation strategies, it is uncertain whether these plans will continue to be sufficient to fully offset the potential impact that travel and facility access restrictions (or other unanticipated impediments) may have on our ability to execute our research and development activities in a timely and cost effective manner.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug regulator interactions. The FDA, comparable foreign regulatory agencies, and ethics boards may experience operational interruptions or delays, which could impact timelines for regulatory meetings, submissions, trial initiations, and regulatory approvals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial reporting and compliance. To date, there has been no adverse impact on our ability to maintain our established financial reporting functions and internal controls over financial reporting. However, our ability to prepare our financial results timely and accurately is partially dependent upon
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the availability of third-party information systems and other cloud-based services. Any degradation in the quality or timeliness of critical third-party information or cloud-based services could adversely impact our financial reporting capabilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Overall, we cannot at this time predict the specific extent, duration, or full impact that the COVID-19 outbreak will have on our financial condition and operations. The impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak on our consolidated financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related governmental advisories and restrictions. These developments and the impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets and the overall economy are highly uncertain. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy are impacted for an extended period, our results may be adversely affected. 
 License Agreements and Intellectual Property 
 General 
 We actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including compounds, compositions and formulations, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture both in the United States and other countries. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to exclude others from infringing our proprietary rights. However, patent protection may not afford us complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. 
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management, research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely, and will in the future rely, on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
Collaborations and Licensing Agreements 
 We have entered into various arrangements with licensors and licensees. Our current significant collaborations are summarized below: 
 Johnson & Johnson: In June 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutical NV (Janssen NV), an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson, in which we received an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to seladelpar and certain other PPARd compounds (the PPARd Products) with the right to grant sublicenses to third parties to make, use and sell such PPARd Products. Under the terms of the agreement, we have full control and responsibility over the research, development and registration of any PPARd Products and are required to use diligent efforts to conduct all such activities. Janssen NV has the sole responsibility for the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance of, and defense of certain patents related to the PPARd Products. Janssen NV has a right of first negotiation under the agreement to license PPARd Products from us in the event that we elect to seek a third-party corporate partner for the research, development, promotion, and/or commercialization of such PPARd Product. Under the terms of the agreement Janssen NV is entitled to receive up to an 8% royalty on net sales of PPARd Products. Under the terms of the agreement, if we do not expend more than a de minimis amount of effort and resources on the research and/or development of at least one PPARd Product, such action would constitute a default under the agreement. In addition, if we fail to use diligent efforts to promote, market and sell any PPARd Product under the agreement, such action would constitute a 
 
14 

Index to Financial Statements
   default under the agreement. In the event of such default, or upon our termination of the agreement, we are obligated to grant Janssen NV a worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable license under the agreement in all information that is controlled, developed or acquired by us that relates to a PPARd compound or PPARd Product and in all patents that are filed during the term of the agreement with a priority date after the effective date of the agreement and relate to a PPARd compound or PPARd Product. 
 In June 2010, we entered into two development and license agreements with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen), an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson, under which Janssen obtained the right to further develop undisclosed metabolic disease target agonists for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and other disorders, and we received a one-time nonrefundable technology access fee related to the agreements. These development and licensing agreements were terminated as of April 2015. In December 2015, we exercised an option pursuant to the terms of one of the original agreements to continue work to research, develop and commercialize compounds with activity against an undisclosed metabolic disease target. Janssen granted us an exclusive, worldwide license (with rights to sublicense) under the Janssen know-how and patents to research, develop, make, have made, import, use, offer for sale and sell such compounds. We have full control and responsibility over the research, development and registration of any products developed and/or discovered from the metabolic disease target and are required to use diligent efforts to conduct all such activities. 
 DiaTex: On June 30, 1998, we entered into a License and Development Agreement with DiaTex, Inc. Under the agreement, DiaTex granted us an exclusive license to develop and commercialize therapeutic products containing halofenate, its enantiomers, derivatives, and analogs (the licensed products) for the treatment of diseases. CB-0406 is a derivative of halofenate. 
 The license agreement contains a $2,000 per month license fee as well as a requirement to make additional payments for development achievements and royalty payments on any sales of licensed products. DiaTex is entitled to up to $0.8 million for the future development of CB-0406, as well as a 2% royalty payment on any net sales of products containing CB-0406. Under the terms of the agreement, if we fail to use diligent efforts to conduct preclinical and clinical testing of halofenate and its enantiomers to determine its efficacy for use in the treatment or prevention of human diseases or conditions, fail to make any payment called for under the agreement, or disclose non-exempt confidential information under the agreement, such action would constitute a material breach under the agreement. In addition, if we fail to execute all instruments and assignments or fail to take any action to effect joint ownership of any enantiomer patent with DiaTex, such action would constitute a material breach under the agreement. We may terminate the agreement at any time if we determine we are no longer interested in DiaTex’s license grant, provided we provide sufficient written notice within a specified time period. 
 Research and Development 
 We do not currently own or operate research and development facilities. We rely on contract service providers (CSPs) including clinical research organizations, clinical trial sites, central laboratories and other service providers to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. We have relied and plan to continue to rely upon CSPs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing clinical programs for our product candidates, as well as the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our CSPs’ activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CSPs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us, which could also adversely affect the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.

   Intellectual Property 
 We own or co-own approximately 40 United States patents and 200 foreign patents, as well as approximately 20 United States patent applications and 50 foreign and Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that are counterparts to certain United States patents and patent applications. In addition, we license from third parties approximately 20 United States patents and 1 United States patent application, 330 foreign patents and 20 foreign and Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that are counterparts to certain United States patents and patent applications. These patents and patent applications include claims covering various aspects of our product pipeline and research and development strategies, including certain PPARd agonists (including seladelpar), their compositions and uses both alone and in combination with other drugs, CB-0406 methods of use and methods of manufacture, and certain GPR119 and GPR120 agonist compositions and uses. 
 The seladelpar portfolio consists of approximately 480 issued patents and 60 pending patent applications related to composition and method of use that expire between 2025 and 2038, before accounting for any potential patent term extension or orphan disease exclusivity. Patent and trade secret protection is critical to our business. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce patents and other intellectual property, to extend the life of patents covering our product candidates, to preserve trade secrets and proprietary know-how, and to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production or testing of seladelpar or other product candidates that we develop, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We presently depend on third party contract manufacturers to obtain all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished products for our clinical studies for seladelpar. We also expect to use third party contract manufacturers to obtain our commercial supplies of seladelpar. We have executed manufacturing agreements for our API and clinical supplies of seladelpar with established manufacturing firms that are responsible for sourcing and obtaining the raw materials necessary for the finished products. The raw materials necessary to manufacture the API for seladelpar are available from more than one source. 
Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant innovation. Although we believe that our development expertise and scientific knowledge provide us with advantages over our competitors, particularly in the therapeutic areas in which we are focused, other biopharmaceutical companies in the industry may be able to develop therapeutics that are able to achieve better results. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. 
 We have been developing seladelpar for the treatment of patients with PBC and NASH; competition in these indications is discussed further below. 
 PBC Competition 
 Currently, the only FDA-approved treatments for PBC are ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), also known as ursodiol, an isomer of chenodeoxycholic acid and the synthetic bile acid analog obeticholic acid (Ocaliva®, Intercept Pharmaceuticals). Ursodiol decreases serum levels of ALP, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, cholesterol, and immunoglobulin M, all of which are elevated in patients with PBC and can serve as biochemical markers of the disease. In a study that combined data from three controlled trials with a total of 548 patients, ursodiol significantly reduced the likelihood of liver transplantation or death after 
 
16 

Index to Financial Statements
   four years. Ursodiol also delayed the progression of hepatic fibrosis in early-stage PBC, but was not effective in advanced disease. It is also known that up to 50% of PBC patients fail to respond adequately to ursodiol therapy. Ursodiol is available as a generic and is priced at a discount to typical branded therapies. 
 Ocaliva was approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency in 2016 for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. Ocaliva also received orphan designations in the U.S. and the E.U. A Phase 3 study was completed with a primary composite endpoint defined as a responder rate comprised of the percentage of patients with ALP < 1.67 times upper limit of normal with a decrease in ALP of at least 15% and total bilirubin less than or equal to upper limit of normal. This study met its goals and Ocaliva was granted accelerated approval based on meeting this primary composite endpoint. 
 Although not approved for use in PBC, off-label use of fibrate drugs has been reported, though many fibrates are specifically contraindicated for use in PBC due to potential concerns over acute and long-term safety in this patient population. Nevertheless, off-label use of fibrates is mentioned in several published treatment guidelines. Other therapies, such as colchicine, methotrexate, prednisone and multiple immunosuppressive regimens have been attempted. However, their efficacy is limited or unproven, and they are associated with multiple side-effects impacting tolerance and safety. Liver transplantation improves survival in patients with PBC, and it is the only effective treatment for those with liver failure. Liver transplantation however is problematic because of its costs, the limited availability of donor organs, and by the fact that the disease may recur after an initially successful transplantation. As a result, despite the previously mentioned therapeutic interventions, it is recognized that PBC continues to progress in many patients and additional medical treatment is needed to address this disease. 
 Elafibranor (Genfit S.A.) is a mixed PPARa/d agonist in development for patients with PBC. In April 2019, Genfit announced elafibranor had been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of PBC. In December 2018, Genfit announced positive Phase 2 results from a Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor (80 mg and 120 mg once-daily) in adult patients with PBC who had an inadequate response to UDCA. In September 2020, Genfit announced the commencement of a Phase 3 study of elafibranor in patients with PBC who had an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. Another potential therapy in clinical development for PBC is the dual PPARa/g agonist saroglitazar (Zydus Cadila). In November 2020, Phase 2 results were presented at the Liver Meeting hosted by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease. In December 2020, Zydus announced saroglitizar had been granted Fast Track Designation for PBC and in January 2021 it received Orphan Drug Designation for PBC by the FDA. The selective NOX inhibitor GKT137831 (Calliditas) has also reported Phase 2 study data for PBC and announced its intention to conduct a Phase 2/3 study in PBC commencing in the second half of 2021. In cholestatic pruritus, GSK2330672 (GlaxoSmithKline) is an inhibitor of the Intestinal Bile Acid Transporter (IBAT), which is undergoing evaluation for decreasing symptoms of pruritus, including in PBC. 
 NASH Competition 
 There are currently no drugs approved in the U.S. or E.U. for the treatment of NASH. In September 2019, Intercept Pharmaceuticals filed a New Drug Application to the U.S. FDA for obeticholic acid in patients with fibrosis due to NASH. Several clinical studies have been completed or are underway with drug candidates that may affect disease outcomes in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH, including Phase 3 studies with OCA, an FXR-agonist (Intercept Pharmaceuticals), cenicriviroc, a CCR2/5 receptor antagonist (Abbvie), and Resmitiron, a THR-beta agonist (Madrigal). Novo Nordisk is also planning to start a Phase 3 study in NASH in 2021 with semaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist. In addition, over two dozen other compounds are currently in Phase 2 development in NASH.

   Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical drug product candidates that we develop must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they may be legally marketed in the United States. 
United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and implements regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practices (GCP), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) for a new pharmaceutical product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice standards (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of selected preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain. 
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the 
 
18 

Index to Financial Statements
   FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor by way of a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin and, once begun, issues may arise that lead to suspension or termination of such clinical study. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of a Phase 2 trial and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug candidate. 
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, who are generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. 
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

• | Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well-controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are required by the FDA for an NDA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on 
 
19 

Index to Financial Statements
   various grounds, including, but not limited to, a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 United States Review and Approval Processes 
 Pre-Approval Requirements 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the pharmaceutical product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any pharmaceutical product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has 10 months from filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from filing for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the pharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the pharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. 
 
20 

Index to Financial Statements
   Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to assure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling. 
 The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. The NDA may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. 
 EMA’s recently established PRIME regulatory initiative similarly provides early enhanced regulatory support to facilitate regulatory applications and accelerate the review of medicines that address a high unmet need. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before

   submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective. A comparable orphan drug program is provided under EU law. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the United States Department of Justice and/or United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses. 
 Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.

   U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits certain individuals and entities, including us, from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, have increased their enforcement efforts with respect to the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA may result in large civil and criminal penalties and could result in an adverse effect on a company’s reputation, operations, and financial condition. A company may also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges. 
 Federal and State HealthCare Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare laws have been applied to restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exemptions or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The intent standard of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below). 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

   The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives. 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 These federal and state laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate its business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates are ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our pharmaceutical product candidates, some of our patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman 
 
24 

Index to Financial Statements
   Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending upon the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. Currently seven years of reference product exclusivity are available to pharmaceutical products designated as orphan drugs, during which the FDA may not approve generic products relying upon the reference product’s data. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. While commercial payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our pharmaceutical product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, in the United States there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payors and by government agencies. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payors may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products and/or reimburse our products at a lower rate. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 
25 

Index to Financial Statements
   The marketability of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010 the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following: 
 

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new transparency reporting requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Section 6002 of the PPACA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to 
 
26 

Index to Financial Statements
   delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the PPACA and it is unclear how these laws and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the PPACA, but it is unclear when a decision will be made. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the PPACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the PPACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, or joint committee, to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The joint committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 More recently, there have been several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product

   pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 International Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our future product candidates. Whether or not FDA approval is obtained for a product, approval of a product must be obtained by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before clinical studies or marketing of the product can commence in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In addition, certain regulatory authorities in select countries may require us to repeat previously conducted preclinical and/or clinical studies under specific criteria for approval in their respective country which may delay and/or greatly increase the cost of approval in certain markets targeted for approval by us. 
Environment, Health and Safety 
 Various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board is in the process of drafting regulations to meet state emissions targets. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. However, because we are not an energy-intensive business, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would likely be material to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. 
 We are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, and various compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Certain misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties. We have implemented proactive programs to reduce and minimize the risk of hazardous materials incidents.
