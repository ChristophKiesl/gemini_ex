Item 1.       Business
 
Track Group, Inc., (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”), a Delaware corporation since 2016 and previously incorporated in 1995 as a Utah corporation, has its principal place of business at 200 E. 5th Avenue Suite 100, Naperville, Illinois 60563. Our telephone number is (877) 260-2010. We maintain a corporate website at www.trackgrp.com. Our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), is currently listed for quotation on the OTCQX Premier Marketplace (“OTCQX”) under the symbol “TRCK”. Unless specified otherwise, as used in this Annual Report, references to Track Group, Inc. include the Company and its subsidiaries: Track Group Americas, Inc., a Utah corporation; Track Group – Puerto Rico, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation; Emerge Monitoring, Inc., a Florida corporation; Emerge Monitoring II LLC, a Florida limited liability company; Integrated Monitoring Systems, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company; Track Group Chile S.p.A, a corporation formed under the laws of the Republic of Chile; Track Group Analytics Limited, a corporation formed under the laws of Canada; and, Track Group International Ltd., a company formed under the laws of Israel (collectively, the “Subsidiaries”).
 
Company Background
 
The Company designs, manufactures, and markets location tracking devices and develops and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions, and monitoring applications. Our products and services include a full-range of one-piece GPS tracking devices, a device-agnostic operating system, a portfolio of software applications including smartphone, alcohol and predictive analytics, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. Our products and services are currently available worldwide and are sold through our direct sales force, as well as through value-added resellers. The Company sells to government customers on federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and to members of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) internationally. Track Group’s device-agnostic platform and expanded portfolio of integrated and complimentary monitoring-related services help reduce risk and make the administration of justice better, faster, and less expensive for taxpayers.
Business Strategy
 
We are committed to helping our customers improve offender rehabilitation and re-socialization outcomes through our innovative hardware, software, and services. We treat our business as a service business. Although we still manufacture patented tracking technology, we see the physical goods as only a small part of the integrated offender monitoring solutions we provide. Accordingly, rather than receiving a payment just for a piece of manufactured equipment, the Company receives a recurring stream of revenue for ongoing device agnostic subscription contracts. As part of our strategy, we continue to expand our device-agnostic platform to not only collect, but also store, analyze, assess and correlate location data for both accountability and auditing reasons, as well as to use for predictive analytics and assessment of effective and emerging techniques in criminal behavior and rehabilitation. We believe a high-quality customer experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of our products and services greatly enhances our ability to attract and retain customers. Therefore, our strategy also includes building and expanding our own direct sales force and our third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a world-class sales and post-sales support experience. In addition, we are developing related-service offerings to address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors. We believe continual investment in research and development (“R&D”), including smartphone applications and other monitoring services is critical to the development and sale of innovative technologies and integrated solutions today and in the future.
 
Recent Developments
 
COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted both the Company’s revenue and costs by disrupting its operations in Chile, causing shortages within the supply chain and postponing sales opportunities as some government agencies delay new RFP (Request for Proposal) processes. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors). Notwithstanding the challenges, the monitoring being performed by the Company’s significant customers across the globe have remained operational as have key business partners providing manufacturing and call center services. Furthermore, at this time, the Company has not experienced unusual payment interruptions from any large customers and the majority of Company employees have effectively worked from home to mitigate the challenges created by COVID-19. As the conditions have improved with respect to COVID-19, both our Chile office and the corporate headquarters in the greater-Chicago area have recently reopened. However, the Company is operating in a rapidly changing environment so the extent to which COVID-19 impacts its business, operations and financial results from this point forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that the Company cannot accurately predict. Those factors include the following: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the widespread availability and acceptance of COVID vaccines; the ability of our supply chain to meet the Company’s need for equipment; the ability to sell and provide services and solutions if shelter in place restrictions and people working from home are extended to ensure employee safety; the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates and the subsequent effect on international transactions; any closures of clients’ offices or the courts on which they rely and any requirements imposed by customers regarding the vaccination status of those Company employees, contractors or partners who are assisting those customers in running their programs.

Chilean Prison System
 
The Company previously disclosed on May 7, 2020 that the Chilean Prison System (“GENCHI”), which has been our customer since 2014, had notified the Company of its decision to award a new contract to a competitor of the Company. Subsequently, since the competitor did not proceed to sign the contract in due time, GENCHI rescinded the prior award to the competitor and re-awarded the Company with a new contract for forty-one months. The Company signed the new contract on July 30, 2020 and the Contraloria General de la Republica de Chile approved the new contract on October 1, 2020. As a result, the Company completed construction of a new monitoring center in Santiago, Chile and expects a back-up monitoring center in Southern Chile required by the new contract to be completed in December 2021. GENCHI will commence implementation of the new contract shortly after the completion of the back-up center.
Conrent Facility Agreement
 
On October 21, 2020, the Company requested, in writing, an additional extension to the maturity date of that certain facility agreement between the Company and Conrent Invest, S.A. (Conrent"), dated December 30, 2013, as amended on February 24, 2019, and further amended on January 7, 2020 (the "Amended Facility Agreement"), which previously provided for a $30.4 million unsecured debt facility. On November 25, 2020, the investors who owned the securities from Conrent used to finance the facility (the "Noteholders") held a meeting to address the Company’s request and approved a new maturity date of July 1, 2024. On December 21, 2020, Conrent and the Company signed an amendment to the Amended Facility Agreement (the "Amended Facility") which extends the maturity date of the agreement to July 1, 2024, capitalizes the accrued and unpaid interest increasing the outstanding principal amount and reduces the interest rate of the Amended Facility from 8% to 4%. On June 28, 2021, the Company restarted interest payments to Conrent under the Amended Facility which will be made semi-annually going forward. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Product Support and Services
 
Monitoring Centers
 Our monitoring centers provide live 24/7/365 monitoring of all alarms generated from our devices, as well as customer and technical support. Our monitoring center operators play a vital role, and as such, are staffed with highly trained, bi-lingual individuals. These operators act as an extension of agency resources receiving alarms, communicating and intervening with offenders regarding violations, and interacting with supervision staff, all pursuant to agency-established protocols. The facilities have redundant power source, battery backup and triple redundancy in voice, data, and IP. We have assisted in the establishment of monitoring centers for customers and local partners in the United States, Chile and other global locations.
Customer Care
 We offer a range of support options for our customers. These include assistance that is built into software products, printed and electronic product manuals, in-person training, online support including comprehensive product information, as well as technical assistance.
Research and Development Program
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we incurred research and development expense of $1,548,527, as compared to $1,182,542 recognized during fiscal year 2020. The $365,985 increase in research and development cost reflects higher wages and payroll taxes of $363,537 as a result of the completion of our new technology platform and higher dues and subscriptions of $18,240, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment of $24,651. The Company completed its new technology platform during fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, which has been rolled out to the majority of its U.S. customers. The Company has now significantly enhanced its technology platform to improve the efficiency of its software, firmware, user interface, and automation. As a result of these improvements, $1,349,550 was capitalized as developed technology during the year ended September 30, 2021. A portion of this expense would have been recognized as research and development expense, absent the significant enhancements to the technology. This represented a decrease of $164,932 compared to the $1,514,482 capitalized as developed technology during the year ended September 30, 2020.
Competition
 
The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and we are confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of our business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and technological advances. Our competitors selling tracking devices have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. Our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to us include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong software ecosystem, service and support, and corporate reputation.
 
Our specific competitors vary from market to market and we compete against other international, national and regional companies, some of whom use local partners that may have more knowledge of the local markets and the government decision making process. Some of our competitors are owned by large public companies with broader resources, while others are backed by private equity firms with large funds, or in some cases, work as part of a consortium with extensive international experience. We expect competition in these markets to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of our products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with third-party providers to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Relationships with High-Quality Government Customers. We have developed strong relationships with federal, state and county customers within the United States and with Ministries of Justice internationally and managed to bring in new, sizable customers in the past year.
 
Industry Leading Analytics Software. Our software remains a leader with fully functioning, revenue-generating analytics on the market today, specifically designed for the offender monitoring market. State departments of corrections, county probation agencies and Sheriff’s offices have utilized this solution for multiple years.

Device Agnostic Software Platform. Our software platform is device agnostic and currently accommodates offender monitoring of new products that we introduce, integrates with case management software utilized by sheriff, probation and pre-trial departments, and adds devices manufactured by competitors.
Smartphone Monitoring Pioneers in Criminal Justice. Today’s prison system incarcerates too many individuals who pose little threat to public safety, at far too great a cost. They serve their sentences in overcrowded, outdated institutions that expose them to hardened criminals. Upon release, their opportunities and lives have changed forever. Now, low-risk offender populations can serve their sentences virtually, holding jobs and taking care of family members, yet still feeling the weight of their punishment while seeing a clear path to avoiding trouble in the future. Further, taxpayers gain a clear cost advantage. To date, we have developed apps targeting alcohol monitoring, domestic violence and our core monitoring platform.
Experienced Senior Management Team. Our top executives have extensive experience in both the offender monitoring marketplace and their specific fields of expertise, whether that be sales, customer care and/or technology. We also benefit from a diverse and experienced Board of Directors.
Recurring Revenue. Our revenue is generated in large part by long-term customer contracts based on the size of the offender monitoring program throughout each month, which creates a predictable, recurring revenue stream.
Extensive Product Suite. We have a large variety of products that appeal to a broad range of government customers and greatly enhance our ability to attract and retain clients. These products include different GPS devices, alcohol monitoring devices and applications, and new smartphone applications including those that address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors and analytics software.
National Footprint with International Presence. We operate in approximately 37 states as well as select international locations, including Chile, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia and Bahamas. Our presence both within the United States and abroad better positions us to compete for new and expiring government contracts.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of our product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and quality within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the risk of loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
 
The industry in which the Company operates, as well as many other industries (automotive, consumer products and medical devices), have been impacted by the global semiconductor shortage initially caused by the slowdown of many chip makers and logistics companies due to COVID-19. See Item 1A Risk Factors.
 
Dependence on Major Customers
 
We had sales to two entities that each represent 10% or more of our gross revenue, as follows for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively:
 

 | 2021 | | % | | 2020 | | % 
-----------+------+-----------+---+----+------+---+----------
Customer A | $ | 6,155,718 | | 16 | % | $ | 6,374,742 | 19 | %
Customer B | $ | 6,119,965 | | 15 | % | $ | 452,904 | 1 | %
Customer C | $ | 2,845,655 | | 7 | % | $ | 3,710,759 | 11 | %
Customer D | $ | 2,833,972 | | 7 | % | $ | 2,561,537 | 8 | %

 
No other customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 or 2020.

Concentration of credit risk associated with our total and outstanding accounts receivable as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are shown in the table below: 
 

 | 2021 | | % | | 2020 | | % 
-----------+------+-----------+---+----+------+---+--------
Customer A | $ | 1,150,046 | | 16 | % | $ | 536,587 | 10 | %
Customer B | $ | 1,052,538 | | 15 | % | $ | 410,933 | 7 | %
Customer C | $ | 375,526 | | 5 | % | $ | 374,809 | 7 | %
Customer D | $ | 753,618 | | 11 | % | $ | 494,237 | 9 | %

Dependence on Major Suppliers
 
We purchase cellular services from several major suppliers. The cost to us for these services during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was $1,943,956 and $2,033,487, respectively. The 4% decrease in cellular service expense in 2021 compared to 2020 resulted largely due to lower negotiated communication costs.
 
During the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we also purchased a significant portion of our inventory and monitoring equipment from certain suppliers. The cost of these purchases during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was $2,898,266 and $1,275,839, respectively. The increase in monitoring equipment was largely due to purchases in fiscal 2021 related to our newest 4G LTE device, which was introduced to customers in the first fiscal quarter of 2021.
 
Intellectual Property

We currently hold rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of our hardware devices, accessories, software and services. We have registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although we believe the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
 
We file patent applications as needed to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design, and are currently pursuing numerous patent applications around the world. Over time, we have accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. We hold copyrights relating to certain aspects of our products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting our products. We believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.
 
Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, processes and services. Although we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses can be obtained in the future on reasonable terms, or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which we compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. 
 
Trademarks. We have developed and use trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own nine trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, plus one trademark registered in Mexico and one in Canada. In addition, we have the Track Group trademark and design registered in various countries around the world.
 
We will file additional applications for the registration of our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions as our business expands under current and planned distribution arrangements. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration in the United States.

Trade Secrets. We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.
 
We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations.
 
Currently, we are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations.
Seasonality
 
Given the consistency in recurring domestic monitoring revenue by customers throughout fiscal 2021, we detected no apparent seasonality in our business. However, as in previous years, incremental domestic device deployment opportunities typically slow down in the months of July and August. We believe this is due to the unavailability of judicial and corrections officials who observe a traditional vacation season during this period. In addition, the operation in Chile generally lowers around Christmas time due to the courts willingness to permit offenders being monitored to visit family.
Employees
 
As of December 1, 2021, we had 149 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage and management believes that relations with employees are good.
Additional Available Information
 
We make available, free of charge, at our corporate website (www.trackgrp.com) copies of our annual reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We also provide copies of our Forms 8-K, 10-K, 10-Q, and proxy statements at no charge to investors upon request.
 
All reports filed by us with the SEC are available free of charge via EDGAR through the SEC website at www.sec.gov.
