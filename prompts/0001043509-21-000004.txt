Item 1.  Business.
Sonic Automotive, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1997. References to “Sonic,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Sonic Automotive, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States (the “U.S.”) (as measured by total revenue). As a result of the way we manage our business, we had two reportable segments as of December 31, 2020: (1) the Franchised Dealerships Segment and (2) the EchoPark Segment. For management and operational reporting purposes, we group certain businesses together that share management and inventory (principally used vehicles) into “stores.” As of December 31, 2020, we operated 84 stores in the Franchised Dealerships Segment and 16 stores in the EchoPark Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment consists of 96 new vehicle franchises (representing 21 different brands of cars and light trucks) and 14 collision repair centers in 12 states. 
The Franchised Dealerships Segment provides comprehensive services, including (1) sales of both new and used cars and light trucks; (2) sales of replacement parts and performance of vehicle maintenance, manufacturer warranty repairs, and paint and collision repair services (collectively, “Fixed Operations”); and (3) arrangement of extended warranties, service contracts, financing, insurance and other aftermarket products (collectively, “finance and insurance” or “F&I”) for our guests. The EchoPark Segment sells used cars and light trucks and arranges F&I product sales for our guests in pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations. Our EchoPark business generally operates independently from our franchised dealerships business (except for certain shared back-office functions and corporate overhead costs). We believe that the continued expansion of our EchoPark business will provide long-term benefits to the Company, our stockholders and our guests. 
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global economy beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continued throughout the remainder of 2020. The impact on the economy affected both consumer demand and supply of manufactured goods as many countries around the world and states and municipalities in the U.S. mandated restrictions on citizen movements (i.e., shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders) or on in-person retail trade or manufacturing activities at physical locations. As a result, many businesses curtailed operations and furloughed or terminated employees. In the U.S., the federal government passed several relief measures, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, in an attempt to provide short-term relief to families and businesses as a result of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This broader economic backdrop resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic had a direct impact on our business and operations in 2020. As a result of the pandemic and related shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, we transitioned many of our teammates to remote work arrangements. In situations where a teammate’s role did not permit remote work (e.g., service repair technicians), we implemented staggered work hours, social distancing and other safety measures to promote the health and safety of our teammates and guests. As a result of the systems and infrastructure we had in place prior to the pandemic, we were largely able to maintain our back-office operations, financial reporting and internal control processes with minimal disruption or changes in the effectiveness of such processes.
All of our store operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to varying degrees. During the end of the first quarter of 2020 and the first two months of the second quarter of 2020, the majority of our stores were not permitted to conduct retail sales of new and used vehicles at our physical locations. Those locations could offer virtual sales transactions with “contactless” delivery to customers but experienced lower consumer demand as a result of the initial onset of the pandemic and state and local governmental restrictions on business and consumer activities. Due to the critical nature of automotive repair, our fixed operations were deemed “essential” by governmental agencies and have largely been able to continue to conduct business so far, while adjusting operations to comply with state and local standards for safety and social distancing to promote the health and safety of our teammates and guests. As a result, in the first quarter and second quarter of 2020, we experienced a decrease in total revenues of 3% and 19%, respectively, as compared to the applicable prior year quarter. Beginning in the latter part of the second quarter of 2020, vehicle sales and fixed operations repair activity began to improve as state and local jurisdictions relaxed their shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders and consumer activity began to recover into the third quarter of 2020. For the third quarter of 2020, total revenues decreased 6% compared to the prior year quarter. As of December 31, 2020, most of such restrictions had been relaxed; however, our stores remain subject to certain health and safety policies and practices that may affect the way we sell vehicles and interact with our guests. For the fourth quarter of 2020, total revenues increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter. 
The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve. While we currently expect to see continued economic recovery in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, the ongoing pandemic may cause changes in consumer behaviors, including a potential reduction in consumer spending for vehicles and automotive repairs, especially if the pandemic worsens or the regulatory environment changes in response to the pandemic. This may lead to increased asset recovery and

valuation risks, such as impairment of additional indefinite lived intangible assets. In addition, uncertainties in the global economy may negatively impact our suppliers and other business partners, which may interrupt our vehicle and parts inventory supply chain and require other changes to our operations. These and other factors may adversely impact our revenues, operating income and earnings per share financial measures.
Based on the events and circumstances at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the first quarter of 2020, we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. This evaluation included reviews of fixed assets and related right-of-use assets, franchise assets and goodwill. As a result of this evaluation, we determined the carrying values of all indefinite lived intangible assets to be recoverable at March 31, 2020 with the exception of goodwill related to our franchised dealership reporting unit, resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $268.0 million. One of the primary factors which contributed to the conclusion that goodwill was impaired was the decline in the market value of Sonic’s stock between the announcement date of the pandemic on March 11, 2020 and March 31, 2020. Based on the improvement in our business operations and market value during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, our future forecast expectations, and the results of our qualitative test, it was determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value. See Note 5, “Intangible Assets and Goodwill,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
The following charts depict the multiple sources of continuing operations revenue and gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020: 
SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.

As of December 31, 2020, we operated in the following states:

Market | Number of Franchised Stores | Number of EchoPark Stores | | Percent of2020 TotalRevenue

Total | 84 | | 16 | | 100.0 | %

In the future, we may acquire dealerships or open new stores that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and divest dealerships or close stores that we believe will not yield acceptable returns over the long term. The retail automotive industry remains highly fragmented, and we believe that further consolidation may occur. We believe that attractive acquisition opportunities continue to exist for dealership groups with the capital and experience to identify, acquire and professionally manage dealerships. Our ability to complete acquisitions and open new stores in the future will depend on many factors, including the availability of financing and the existence of any contractual provisions that may restrict our acquisition activity.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of our plans for the use of capital generated from operations.
Reportable Segments
As of December 31, 2020, we had two reportable segments: (1) the Franchised Dealerships Segment and (2) the EchoPark Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles and buy and sell used vehicles, sell replacement parts, perform vehicle maintenance, warranty and repair services, and arrange finance and insurance products. The EchoPark Segment is comprised of pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations that provide guests an opportunity to search our nationwide inventory, purchase a pre-owned vehicle, select finance and insurance products and sell their current vehicle to us.
For 2020, EchoPark Segment revenue represented approximately 14.5% of total revenue, up from 11.1% in 2019. See Note 14, “Segment Information,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our two reportable segments.
Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion of our business is presented on a consolidated basis.
Business Strategy
Execute Our EchoPark Expansion Plan. We have developed a diversified business model by augmenting our manufacturer-franchised dealership operations with our EchoPark pre-owned vehicle specialty retail business. Our EchoPark business generally operates independently from our franchised dealerships business (except for certain shared back-office functions and corporate overhead costs) and offers consumers a modern guest experience and a wide selection of quality pre-owned vehicle inventory at low prices. Sales operations for EchoPark began in the fourth quarter of 2014, and, as of December 31, 2020, we operated 16 EchoPark stores in eight states. During 2020, we announced an accelerated EchoPark growth plan in which we hope to open 25 additional EchoPark stores annually from 2021 to 2025 as we build out an expected 140-plus point nationwide EchoPark distribution network by 2025.
Expand Our Omni-Channel Capabilities. Automotive consumers have become increasingly more comfortable using technology to research their vehicle buying alternatives, communicate with store personnel, and complete a portion or all of a vehicle purchase online. The internet presents a marketing, advertising and sales channel that we will continue to utilize to drive 
SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.

value for our stores and enhance the guest experience. Our existing platforms give us the ability to leverage new technology to integrate systems, customize our dealership websites and use our data to improve the effectiveness of our advertising and interaction with our guests. These platforms also allow us to market all of our products and services to a national audience and, at the same time, support the local market penetration of our individual stores. We believe that the ongoing development of our e-commerce platform will drive incremental revenues and an improved guest experience in the future.
Focus on the Guest Experience. We focus on providing a high-quality guest experience and maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. Our personalized sales process is designed to appeal to our guests by providing high-quality vehicles and service through a positive, “guest-centric” experience. Several manufacturers offer specific financial incentives on a per vehicle basis if certain Customer Satisfaction Index (“CSI”) levels (which vary by manufacturer) are achieved by a dealership. In addition, all manufacturers consider CSI scores in approving acquisitions or awarding new dealership open points. To keep dealership and executive management focused on customer satisfaction, we include CSI results as a component of our incentive-based compensation programs for certain groups of associates and executive management.
Train, Develop and Retain Our Teammates. We believe our teammates are the cornerstone of our business and crucial to our financial success. Our goal is to develop our teammates and foster an environment where our teammates can contribute and grow with the Company. Teammate satisfaction is very important to us, and we believe a high level of teammate satisfaction reduces turnover and enhances our guests’ experience at our stores by pairing our guests with well-trained support personnel. We believe that our comprehensive training of our teammates provides us with an advantage over other competitors in providing a high-quality guest experience.
Optimize Our Capital Structure. As we generate cash through operations, we may opportunistically repurchase our Class A Common Stock or our outstanding debt in open-market or structured transactions to maintain our targeted capital structure.
Maximize Asset Returns Through Process Execution. We have developed standardized operating processes that are documented in operating playbooks for our stores. Through the continued implementation of our operating playbooks, we believe organic growth opportunities exist by offering a more favorable buying experience to our guests and creating efficiencies in our business processes. We believe the development, refinement and implementation of these operating processes will enhance the guest experience, make us more competitive in the markets we serve and drive profit growth across each of our revenue streams.
Maintain Diverse Revenue Streams. We have multiple diverse revenue streams among our two operating segments. In addition to new vehicle sales, our revenue sources include used vehicle sales (including through our EchoPark segment), which we believe are less sensitive to economic cycles and seasonal influences that affect new vehicle sales. Our Fixed Operations sales carry a higher gross margin than new and used vehicle sales and, in the past, have not been as sensitive to economic conditions as new vehicle sales. We also offer guests assistance in obtaining financing and a range of automobile-related warranty, aftermarket and insurance products.
Manage Portfolio. Our long-term growth and acquisition strategy is primarily focused on large metropolitan markets that meet certain strategic criteria for population growth and vehicle registration rates, among other considerations. A majority of our franchised dealerships are either luxury or mid-line import brands. For 2020, approximately 88.2% of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by luxury and mid-line import dealerships, which usually have higher operating margins, more stable Fixed Operations departments, lower associate turnover and lower inventory levels.

Increase Sales of Higher-Margin Products and Services. We continue to pursue opportunities to increase our sales of higher-margin products and services by expanding the following:
Finance, Insurance and Other Aftermarket Products. Each sale of a new or used vehicle gives us an opportunity to provide our guests with financing and insurance options and earn financing fees and insurance and other aftermarket product commissions. We also offer our guests the opportunity to purchase extended warranties, service contracts and other aftermarket products from third-party providers whereby we earn a commission for arranging the contract sale. We currently offer a wide range of non-recourse financing, leasing, other aftermarket products, extended warranties, service contracts and insurance products to our guests. We emphasize menu-selling techniques and other best practices to increase our sales of F&I products at our franchised dealerships and EchoPark stores.
Parts, Service and Collision Repair. Each of our franchised dealerships offers a fully integrated service and parts department. Manufacturers permit warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships such as ours. As a result, our franchised dealerships are uniquely qualified and positioned to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly complex vehicles. We believe we can continue to grow our profitable parts and service business over the long term by increasing service capacity, investing in sophisticated equipment and well-trained technicians, using competitive variable-rate pricing structures, focusing on the guest experience, and efficiently managing our parts inventory. In addition, we believe our emphasis on selling extended service contracts and maintenance contracts associated with retail new and used vehicle sales will drive further service and parts business in our franchised dealerships as we increase the potential to retain current service and parts guests beyond the term of the standard manufacturer warranty period.
Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles. Various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to sell certified pre-owned (“CPO”) vehicles. This certification process extends the standard manufacturer warranty on the CPO vehicle, which we 
SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.

believe increases our potential to retain the pre-owned purchaser as a future parts and service customer. As CPO vehicles can only be sold by franchised dealerships and CPO warranty work can only be performed at franchised dealerships, we believe CPO vehicles add additional sales volume and will increase our Fixed Operations business over the long term.
Relationships with Manufacturers
Each of our franchised dealerships operates under a separate franchise or dealer agreement that governs the relationship between the dealership and the manufacturer. Each franchise or dealer agreement specifies the location of the dealership for the sale of vehicles and for the performance of certain approved services in a specified market area. The designation of such areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory. In addition, most manufacturers allocate vehicles on a “turn and earn” basis that rewards high unit sales volume. A franchise or dealer agreement incentivizes the dealer to meet specified standards regarding showrooms, facilities and equipment for servicing vehicles, inventories, minimum net working capital, personnel training and other aspects of the business. Each franchise or dealer agreement also gives the related manufacturer the right to approve the dealer operator and any material change in management or ownership of the dealership. Each manufacturer may terminate a franchise or dealer agreement under certain circumstances, such as a change in control of the dealership without manufacturer approval, the impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership, the death, removal or withdrawal of the dealer operator, the conviction of the dealership or the dealership’s owner or dealer operator of certain crimes, the failure to adequately operate the dealership or maintain new vehicle inventory or financing arrangements, insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership or a material breach of other provisions of the applicable franchise or dealer agreement.
Many automobile manufacturers have developed and implemented policies regarding public ownership of dealerships, which include the ability to force the sale of their respective franchises:
•upon a change in control of the Company or a material change in the composition of our Board of Directors;
•if an automobile manufacturer or distributor acquires more than 5% of the voting power of our securities; or
•if an individual or entity (other than an automobile manufacturer or distributor) acquires more than 20% of the voting power of our securities, and the manufacturer disapproves of such individual’s or entity’s ownership interest.
To the extent that new or amended manufacturer policies restrict the number of dealerships that may be owned by a dealership group or the transferability of our common stock, such policies could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we will be able to renew at expiration all of our existing franchise and dealer agreements.
Many states have placed limitations upon manufacturers’ and distributors’ ability to sell new motor vehicles directly to customers in their respective states in an effort to protect dealers from practices they believe constitute unfair competition. In general, these statutes make it unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to compete with a new motor vehicle dealer in the same brand operating under an agreement or franchise from the manufacturer or distributor in the relevant market area. Certain states, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, limit the amount of time that a manufacturer or distributor may temporarily operate a dealership. These statutes have been increasingly challenged by new entrants into the retail automotive industry and, to the extent that these statutes are repealed or weakened, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, all of the states in which our dealerships currently do business require manufacturers or distributors to show “good cause” for terminating or failing to renew a dealer’s franchise or dealer agreement. Further, each of these states provides some method for dealers to challenge manufacturer attempts to establish dealerships of the same brand in their relevant market area.
While in any individual period conditions may vary, over the past 10 fiscal years, we have acquired a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process, in addition to vehicle auctions. We also acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners, such as leasing companies and rental companies. The used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market. The supply of late-model used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors, including the total number of vehicles in operation; the volume of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate used car trade-ins; and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels, wholesale transactions and automotive auctions. According to industry sources, there were approximately 280 million light vehicles in operation in the U.S. as of December 31, 2020. During calendar year 2020, it is estimated that approximately 14.5 million new cars and 37 million used cars were sold at retail, many of which were accompanied by trade-ins. Based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year, consumer acceptance of our appraisal 
SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.

process, our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources, and the large size of the U.S. auction market relative to our needs, we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs.
Competition
The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. Depending on the geographic market, we compete both with dealers offering the same brands and product lines as ours and dealers offering other manufacturers’ vehicles. We also compete for vehicle sales with auto brokers, leasing companies and services offered on the internet that provide referrals to other dealerships, broker vehicle sales between customers and other dealerships or sell vehicles directly to customers via online purchase transactions and delivery. We compete with small, local dealerships and with large multi-franchise and pre-owned automotive dealership groups.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in vehicle sales are the location of stores, the ability of stores to offer an attractive selection of the most popular vehicles at competitive market pricing (including the effect of applicable manufacturer rebates, below-market financing from manufacturers or their captive finance subsidiaries, and other special offers), the successful interplay between the virtual and physical aspects of car buying, and the marketing campaigns conducted by manufacturers and the quality of services and guest experience at our stores. In particular, pricing has become more important as a result of well-informed customers using a variety of sources available on the internet to determine current retail market prices. Other competitive factors include customer preference for makes of automobiles and coverage under manufacturer warranties.
In addition to competition for vehicle sales, we also compete with other auto dealers, service and repair centers, auto parts retailers and independent mechanics in providing vehicle parts and service work. We believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are price, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, factory-trained technicians, the familiarity with a manufacturer’s makes and models and the quality of the guest experience. A number of regional and national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices.
In arranging or providing financing for our guests’ vehicle purchases, we compete with a broad range of financial institutions. In addition, certain financial institutions are now offering financing and other F&I products directly to consumers through the internet. We believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience, interest rates and contract terms.
Our success depends, in part, on national and regional automobile-buying trends, local and regional economic factors and other regional competitive pressures. Conditions and competitive pressures affecting the markets in which we operate, such as price-cutting by dealers in these areas, or in any new markets we enter, could adversely affect us, even though the retail automotive industry as a whole might not be affected.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
Numerous federal, state and local regulations govern our business of marketing, selling, financing and servicing automobiles. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to business corporations.
Under the laws of the states in which we currently operate, as well as the laws of other states into which we may expand, we must obtain a license in order to establish, operate or relocate a franchised dealership or EchoPark store or to operate an automotive service and repair center. These laws also regulate our conduct of business, including our sales, operating, advertising, financing and employment practices, including federal and state wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws.
Our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer privacy, consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, usury laws and other installment sales laws. Some states regulate finance fees that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales.
Federal, state and local environmental regulations, including regulations governing air and water quality, the clean-up of contaminated property and the use, storage, handling, recycling and disposal of gasoline, oil and other materials, also apply to us and our franchised dealership and EchoPark properties.
As with automobile dealerships generally, and service, parts and collision repair operations in particular, our business involves the use, storage, handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes and other environmentally sensitive materials. Our business also involves the past and current operation and/or removal of above 
SONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.

ground and underground storage tanks containing such substances, wastes or materials. Accordingly, we are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities that establish health and environmental quality standards, provide for liability related to those standards and provide penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws, ordinances and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities we own or operate or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes and other environmentally sensitive materials for treatment, recycling or disposal.
We do not have any known material environmental liabilities, and we believe that compliance with governmental regulations, including environmental laws and regulations will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. However, soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist at certain properties owned and used by us. Further, environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change. In addition, in connection with our past or future acquisitions, it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities, some of which may be material.
In 2020, the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions to travel and economic activity, including the retail automotive industry. Governmental orders were issued in response to the pandemic and have varied by locality and severity through the duration of the pandemic. Certain state and local governments have mandated restrictions on citizen movements (i.e., shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders) or on retail trade at physical locations which limited the conduct of retail sales of vehicles at our physical locations. Several measures were implemented by various governmental entities in response to the pandemic and our stores remain subject to certain health and safety policies and practices that may affect the way our business operates and how we interact with guests. Due to the critical nature of automotive repair, our parts and service repair operations were deemed “essential” by governmental agencies and have been able to continue to conduct business throughout the pandemic to date, but must maintain state and local standards for social distancing to promote the health and safety of our teammates and guests.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 8,100 associates, or teammates with whom we strive to maintain good relationships, which benefit both our company and our teammates. Approximately 200 of our associates, primarily service technicians in northern California, are represented by a labor union. Although only a small percentage of our associates is represented by a labor union, we may be affected by labor strikes, work slowdowns and walkouts at automobile manufacturers’ manufacturing facilities.
We believe our teammates are key to achieving our business objectives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced restrictions on permitted occupancy or brief closures at many of our locations. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented, and we continue to maintain, protocols designed to protect the health and safety of our teammates and guests. These protocols, which remain in place, meet or exceed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and, where applicable, state mandates. Prior to, or upon returning to work, our teammates were trained on the protocols designed to protect the health and safety of our teammates and guests.
As we manage our workforce, we focus on associate satisfaction, turnover, and training. We benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable companies and in the geographic areas where our operations are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled and unskilled labor throughout our organization. Our notable health, welfare, retirement and training benefits include:
•Company-subsidized health insurance;
•401(k) plan with Company matching contributions;
•paid vacation, sick and bereavement leave;
•paid community service and volunteer leave; and
•tuition assistance programs and Company-paid training opportunities.
We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including in our hiring practices and daily operations. Our teammates have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline. Our policies require all reports of inappropriate behavior to be taken seriously and promptly investigated with appropriate action taken to address and prevent such behavior.
