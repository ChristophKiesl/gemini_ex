ITEM 1. | Business

Overview 
We are a commercial stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering medicines that provide a better life for patients with cancer. We currently market FOTIVDA® (tivozanib) in the United States. FOTIVDA is our first commercial product and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for marketing and sale in the United States on March 10, 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, following two or more prior systemic therapies. We continue to develop tivozanib in immuno-oncology combinations in RCC and other indications, and we have other investigational programs in clinical development.
FOTIVDA is an oral, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or VEGFR, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. The FDA approval of FOTIVDA is based on our pivotal Phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label clinical trial comparing tivozanib to an approved therapy, Nexavar® (sorafenib), in RCC patients whose disease had relapsed or become refractory to two or three prior systemic therapies, which we refer to as the TIVO-3 trial. The approval is also supported by three additional trials in RCC and includes safety data from over 1,000 clinical trial subjects. 
FOTIVDA became commercially available in the United States on March 22, 2021 and is available to patients through a network of specialty pharmacies and distributors. We commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States through the support of approximately 65 field-based employees, which includes approximately 50 oncology sales professionals. The field sales force is supported by the AVEO ACE Patient Support program, which is an extensive patient and healthcare provider support program designed to optimize patient access and help patients navigate their treatment journey. To date, we believe we have been very successful in securing payor coverage. Furthermore, the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, or the NCCN Guidelines®, recommend FOTIVDA as a subsequent therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC with clear cell histology who received two or more prior systemic therapies.
Restrictions related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have posed challenges for gaining in-person access to customers, prescribers and other healthcare professionals and certain institutions remain closed to industry representatives. Notwithstanding these challenges, as of December 31, 2021, prescriptions for FOTIVDA and product revenues have increased quarter over quarter since the beginning of our commercial launch. We aim to continue to deliver quarter over quarter net revenue and underlying prescription demand growth as we continue to execute on our commercial strategy to support the adoption of FOTIVDA in appropriate patients. 
We believe there is significant commercial opportunity for FOTIVDA in RCC in the United States. We estimate that the current U.S. market for relapsed or refractory advanced RCC therapy is more than $1.7 billion, including $1.3 billion in the second line and $480.0 million in the third and fourth lines. As the TIVO-3 trial is the first positive Phase 3 clinical trial in RCC patients whose disease had relapsed or become refractory to two or three prior systemic therapies as well as the first Phase 3 clinical trial in RCC to investigate a predefined subpopulation of patients who received prior immunotherapy, a predominant standard of care for earlier lines of therapy, we believe that FOTIVDA could become a standard of care in the United States in the third and fourth line relapsed or refractory advanced setting. Further, we intend to pursue opportunities in the second line relapsed or refractory advanced RCC setting. We and our collaboration partners are developing tivozanib with immune checkpoint inhibitors, or ICIs, and in combination with a hypoxia inducible factor 2α, or HIF2α, inhibitor to support tivozanib's potential utility in this earlier line of RCC therapy. 
Based on FOTIVDA’s demonstrated anti-tumor activity, tolerability profile and reduction of regulatory T-cell production, we and our collaboration partners are developing tivozanib in additional cancer indications with significant unmet medical needs including, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, and tumors that are resistant to immunotherapy, or immunologically cold tumors, in combination with ICIs. In addition, we are evaluating tivozanib as a monotherapy in ovarian cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, or CCA. We and our collaboration partners or independent investigators sponsor the development of tivozanib through preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted under collaboration agreements and investigator sponsored trial, or IST, agreements or our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute’s Surgical Oncology Program, or NCI-SOP. 
We are also seeking to advance our pipeline of four wholly owned immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody product candidates, ficlatuzumab, AV-380, AV-203 and AV-353. We aim to leverage our existing collaborations and partnerships and enter into new strategic collaborations and partnerships to continue to advance each of our product candidates.
Business Update Regarding COVID-19 
The pandemic caused by an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus and its related variants, or the COVID-19 pandemic, that is affecting the U.S. and global economy and financial markets, is also impacting our employees, patients, communities and business operations to varying degrees. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the duration and extent of travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures and business disruptions, its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets, the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, periodic and seasonal spikes in infection rates, new strains of the virus that cause outbreaks of COVID-19 and the broad availability of effective vaccines and antiviral treatments. In March 2020, we transitioned essentially all of our business operations to be conducted remotely in response to COVID-19. Although senior management has returned to the office, as of February 2022, the majority of our workforce continues to work remotely. Management is actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, commercialization, suppliers, manufacturers, industry and workforce. 
Impact on Commercialization of FOTIVDA. COVID-19 related restrictions have posed challenges for gaining in-person access to customers, prescribers and other healthcare professionals and certain institutions remain closed to industry representatives. We believe these access challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of SARs-CoV-2 variants have potentially slowed the commercial launch trajectory of FOTIVDA delaying our ability to achieve our anticipated market penetration at this stage of our commercial launch. While we have designed our strategic commercial approach to be optimized for remote as well as in-person customer engagement capabilities and expanded our digital marketing strategies in light of the restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to standard sales and marketing practices, including the shift from in-person to video and virtual interactions with healthcare professionals, have caused, and may continue to cause, challenges for the commercialization of FOTIVDA.
Impact on Trial Enrollment and Site Initiations. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the initiation, enrollment and completion of certain of our ongoing and planned clinical trials. For instance, the pandemic partially slowed the enrollment of our open-label, multi-center, randomized Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in combination with AstraZeneca PLC’s, or AstraZeneca, IMFINZI (durvalumab), which we refer to as the DEDUCTIVE trial, in that it hindered patients' ability to attend routine physical medical assessments with their clinicians resulting in delays in diagnosis and, at times, treatment of cancer in patients. This is a phenomenon supported by recent studies finding a decline in cancer screening during the pandemic. In addition, our contract research organization, or CRO, for our Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in RCC patients who have progressed following one or two lines of prior immunotherapy, which we refer to as our TiNivo-2 trial, informed us that it has been impacted by cancer research staffing shortages related to COVID-19 infections and competition for staff, among other things, at clinical trial sites resulting in delays to trial site activation, contracting and enrollment. Currently, certain academic institutions have frozen enrollment on all trials or refused to take on additional clinical trials due to these staffing shortages and these staffing shortages have adversely impacted the DEDUCTIVE trial and the TiNivo-2 trial.
Impact on Manufacturing. The COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, cause delays in the manufacturing of our product candidates ficlatuzumab and AV-380. In 2020, we contracted with a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to manufacture the clinical supply for our potential registrational clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with cetuximab in patients with human papillomavirus, or HPV, negative recurrent or metastatic, or R/M, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, patients. However, in the middle of 2021, our CMO notified us of a shortage of required key raw materials and manufacturing supplies also used in the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing process which would delay the delivery of the clinical supply of ficlatuzumab. We have since secured the required raw materials and manufacturing supplies needed and now plan to manufacture ficlatuzumab Phase 3 clinical supply in the second quarter of 2022.
More recently, another of our CMOs has experienced employee shortages, supply chain issues and other disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic which have delayed and may continue to delay that manufacture of AV-380 preclinical supply. 
To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our commercial and clinical supply of FOTIVDA (tivozanib) or our clinical supply of AV-203. We currently have a sufficient commercial and clinical supply of FOTIVDA (tivozanib) and clinical supply of AV-203 that we believe will meet our ongoing needs for more than twelve months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, there can be no assurance that future developments do not impact the availability of our commercial and clinical supply of FOTIVDA (tivozanib) or our clinical supply of AV-203. For additional information on the risks posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic and our reliance on CMOs, 
please see “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors Dependence on Third Parties” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The key elements of this corporate strategy include:
◦successfully commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies;
◦advance life-cycle development for tivozanib to support its potential utility in immuno-oncology and other novel targeted combinations in RCC and other potential indications; 
◦advance the development of our pipeline of four IgG1 monoclonal antibody product candidates, ficlatuzumab, AV-380, AV-203 and AV-353; and
◦leverage existing collaborations and partnerships and enter into new strategic collaborations and partnerships that can contribute to our ability to efficiently develop our product candidates to provide a better life for patients with cancer.
Our Marketed Product
FOTIVDA
FOTIVDA is an oral, next-generation VEGFR TKI. FOTIVDA was approved by the FDA for marketing and sale in the United States in March 2021 and is sold for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. FOTIVDA was approved in August 2017 by the European Commission, or EC, and other countries in the territory of our partner EUSA Pharma (UK) Limited, or EUSA, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC.
FOTIVDA is a potent, selective inhibitor of VEGFRs 1, 2 and 3 with a long half-life. In addition to the inhibition of VEGFR, FOTIVDA has demonstrated the ability to down regulate regulatory T-cell production in preclinical models. This unique combination of properties is designed to improve efficacy and tolerability of FOTIVDA as a monotherapy or in combination with ICIs and other emerging cancer targets such as HIF2α relative to earlier generations of VEGFR TKIs.
U.S. Commercialization of FOTIVDA in Relapsed or Refractory Advanced RCC
FOTIVDA became commercially available in the United States on March 22, 2021 and is available to patients through a network of specialty pharmacies and distributors. We commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States through the support of approximately 65 field-based employees, which includes approximately 50 oncology sales professionals. The field sales force is supported by the AVEO ACE Patient Support program, which is an extensive patient and healthcare provider support program designed to optimize patient access and help patients navigate their treatment journey. To date, we believe we have been very successful in securing payor coverage. Furthermore, the NCCN Guidelines® recommend FOTIVDA as a subsequent therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC with clear cell histology who received two or more prior systemic therapies.
We believe there is significant commercial opportunity for FOTIVDA in RCC in the United States and that FOTIVDA could become a standard of care in the United States in the third and fourth line relapsed or refractory advanced setting.
 Commercialization of FOTIVDA in RCC Outside the United States
FOTIVDA, through EUSA, is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the European Union, or the EU, New Zealand and South Africa and is reimbursed in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and certain other countries in EUSA’s territory. FOTIVDA is approved in the EU for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC. FOTIVDA has been commercially available in the EU since 2017. EUSA is working to secure reimbursement approval in and commercially launch FOTIVDA in additional countries in the EUSA territory. However, there is significant competition in the first-line RCC setting in the EU 
due to the approval of several immunotherapy combinations which have become a standard of care and impacted the market opportunity for monotherapy treatments.
We are entitled to receive milestone payments upon reimbursement approval for RCC, if any, in each of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, or, collectively, the EU5. EUSA has received reimbursement approval for and commercially launched FOTIVDA in Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain and has also received reimbursement approval for and commercially launched FOTIVDA in additional non-EU5 countries. EUSA is working to secure reimbursement approval in and commercially launch FOTIVDA in additional countries in its licensed territories. We are eligible to receive milestone payments based upon EUSA obtaining marketing approval for up to three additional indications. We may also receive payments for sales milestones based on the aggregate global net sales reached in a particular calendar year.
EUSA has reported to us that, to date, it has not experienced any material decrease in sales trends or interruptions in supply or distribution of FOTIVDA during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FOTIVDA sales in the EUSA territory is difficult to predict. In December 2021, EUSA announced that it had signed an agreement with Recordati, S.p.A. to be acquired and has indicated that the acquisition is anticipated to close in the first half of 2022.
Our Product Candidates
Tivozanib
Our pipeline includes our lead product tivozanib. We are evaluating tivozanib, both as a monotherapy and in combination with ICIs and other emerging cancer targets such as HIF2α, for the treatment of RCC, HCC, immunologically cold tumors and CCA. We and our collaboration partners or independent investigators sponsor the development of tivozanib through preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted under collaboration agreements and IST agreements or our CRADA with NCI-SOP.
We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize tivozanib in oncology indications in all countries outside of Asia and the Middle East under a license from Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (formerly Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd.), or KKC. We have sublicensed to EUSA the right to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our licensed territories outside of North America, including Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa and Australasia. The EUSA sublicense excludes non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. 
Clinical Development of Tivozanib in RCC
Third-Line and Fourth-Line Phase 3 Clinical Trial (TIVO-3): In May 2016, we initiated enrollment in the TIVO-3 trial. The TIVO-3 trial is the first positive Phase 3 clinical trial in the third- and fourth-line treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC as well as the first Phase 3 trial in RCC to investigate a predefined subpopulation of patients who received prior immunotherapy, a predominant standard of care for earlier lines of therapy. Patients were stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk category (favorable, intermediate or poor) and type of prior therapy (two prior VEGFR TKIs, VEGFR TKI plus checkpoint inhibitor or VEGFR TKI plus any other systemic agent) then randomized 1:1 to receive tivozanib or sorafenib. 
In November 2018, we announced that the TIVO-3 trial met its primary endpoint of improving progression free survival, or PFS, with a median PFS in the tivozanib arm of 5.6 months compared with 3.9 months in the sorafenib arm. Tivozanib demonstrated a 44% improvement in median PFS and 27% reduction in risk of progression or death compared to sorafenib (HR=0.73, p=0.02). Approximately 26% of patients received checkpoint inhibitor therapy in earlier lines of treatment. Patients who received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy had exhibited a 45% reduction in risk of progression or death. The secondary endpoint of objective response rate, or ORR, for patients receiving tivozanib was 18% compared to 8% for patients receiving sorafenib (p=0.02). Median duration of response in patients receiving tivozanib was not reached and in patients receiving sorafenib was 5.7 months. Tivozanib was generally better tolerated than sorafenib, as indicated by fewer dose reductions and interruptions. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were consistent with those observed in previous tivozanib trials. Infrequent but severe adverse events reported in greater number in the tivozanib arm were thrombotic events similar to those observed in previous tivozanib studies. The most common adverse events in patients receiving tivozanib was fatigue and asthenia, adverse events known to reflect effective VEGF pathway inhibition. 
In June 2021, additional analyses and long-term follow up results from the TIVO-3 trial were presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting. In February 2022, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary, or ASCO GU, Cancers Symposium, additional long term follow up was presented demonstrating long term PFS benefit and an improving trend in overall survival, or OS, from the TIVO-3 trial (HR 0.89). 
These landmark long-term PFS rates up to 48-months were higher among patients treated with tivozanib as compared to patients treated with sorafenib (12% vs. 2% and 7.6% vs. 0% at three and four years, respectively). 
RCC PD-1 Phase 3 Combination Clinical Trial with OPDIVO® (TiNivo-2): Based on data from our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in combination with OPDIVO (nivolumab), or the TiNivo trial, including data showing few tivozanib dose reductions and additive or synergistic activity for ORR and PFS, we opened enrollment for a Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as the TiNivo-2 trial, in the third quarter of 2021. We are the sponsor of the trial and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, is supplying OPDIVO (nivolumab), BMS’s antibody directed against programmed death-1, or PD-1, therapy for the trial. The TiNivo-2 trial is a randomized, open-label, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab as compared to tivozanib as a monotherapy, in RCC patients who have progressed following one or two lines of prior immunotherapy, one of which must include an ICI. The TiNivo-2 trial is expected to enroll approximately 326 patients from sites in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either tivozanib (0.89 mg/QD for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment) in combination with nivolumab (480 mg every 4 weeks) or tivozanib as a monotherapy (1.34 mg/QD for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment). In February 2022, we amended the protocol to reduce the combination dose of tivozanib to 0.89 mg. The protocol was amended based on (i) emerging evidence that the lower 0.89 mg dose was effective in combination with an ICI, (ii) that the lower dose may optimize the risk/benefit profile and result in better tolerability for the combination and (iii) the FDA’s recommendation to investigate an optimal dose of tivozanib in the combination setting under its Project Optimus initiative. We expect TiNivo-2 trial enrollment to be completed in the first half of 2023. The TiNivo-2 trial’s primary endpoint will assess PFS, with secondary endpoints to include OS, ORR, duration of response and safety. The TiNivo-2 trial will seek to further understand the activity and tolerability of this combination following prior immunotherapy.
RCC HIF2α Phase 2 Clinical Trial with NKT2152: In January 2022, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with NiKang Therapeutics Inc., or NiKang, to evaluate tivozanib in combination with NKT2152, NiKang’s small molecule that inhibits HIF2α. The Phase 2 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of tivozanib and NKT2152 in clear cell RCC, or ccRCC, patients who have not responded to or relapsed from prior therapies. NiKang will sponsor the trial. We are supplying tivozanib at no cost and will co-fund the trial. We expect the Phase 2 clinical trial to commence in 2022.
Clinical Development of Tivozanib in HCC
HCC PD-L1 Combination Trial with IMFINZI® (DEDUCTIVE): We are conducting the DEDUCTIVE trial through a drug supply and cost sharing collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC. The DEDUCTIVE trial is an open-label, multi-center, randomized Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in combination with AstraZeneca's IMFINZI (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1. Enrollment for the first cohort of the trial, which includes patients with advanced, unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease, or cohort A, of the DEDUCTIVE trial is complete and topline results were recently presented at the ASCO Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancers Symposium. Topline efficacy and safety data for cohort A demonstrated that the combination was well tolerated, with three patients showing Grade 3 treatment related adverse events, or TRAEs, and no Grade 4 TRAEs or treatment-related deaths. Further, the combination demonstrated a 27.8% partial response, or PR, rate and a disease control rate (PR plus stable disease) of 67.8%, with a median PFS of 7.3 months and a 1-year OS of 76%, which we believe positions the tivozanib/durvalumab combination well relative to other anti-VEGF ICI combinations in this indication.
The DEDUCTIVE trial was amended in the third quarter of 2021 to include second-line treatment of patients with advanced, unresectable HCC who have progressed after first-line bevacizumab and atezolizumab treatment, or cohort B. The cohort B Phase 2 portion of the trial is designed to enroll 20 patients and enrollment is now expected to be completed in the second half of 2022, a delay from our previous guidance of the first half of 2022. The DEDUCTIVE trial enrollment has been delayed due to several developments including: developments in the HCC standard of care that have led to longer treatment in first line therapies and reduced the presence of a sufficient patient pool suitable for the DEDUCTIVE trial; site staffing shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other competitive factors that have led to enrollment delays at trial sites; and the COVID-19 pandemic hindering patients' ability to attend routine physical medical assessments with their clinicians that resulted in delays in diagnosis and, at times, treatment of cancer in patients. 
Clinical Development of Tivozanib in Ovarian Cancer
In June 2019, Dr. Wendy Swetzig at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine presented data at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting from an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of tivozanib in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, including fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. The trial was one of several studies funded by a grant we provided to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. The trial was designed to measure the safety and activity of tivozanib in ovarian cancer and enrolled a total of 31 patients, 30 of which were treated with tivozanib. With four patients showing a partial response and twelve patients with stable disease, the clinical benefit rate 
(partial response plus stable disease) was reported to be 53.3%. The trial data suggests that tivozanib is active in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, without substantial toxicity.
Clinical Development of Tivozanib in Immunologically Cold Tumors
In September 2021, we entered into an IST Agreement with the University of Florida, or UF, to conduct a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tivozanib in combination with atezolizumab in immunologically cold tumors. Immunologically cold tumors are solid tumors that lack or have few tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and remain a clinical challenge. 
Clinical Development of Tivozanib in Cholangiocarcinoma
In September 2021, we entered into a CRADA with NCI-SOP to conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tivozanib in CCA. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is an open-label, single-center, non-randomized study which enrolled its first patient in March 2022. CCA is an aggressive biliary tract malignancy that remains a clinical challenge with limited treatment options and poor survival rates.
Ficlatuzumab
Ficlatuzumab is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF. The HGF/cMET pathway is implicated as an escape mechanism for epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, blockade. Ficlatuzumab has demonstrated differentiated inhibition of HGF/cMET downstream signaling and demonstrated a strong additive anti-tumor effect in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. 
We have previously reported Phase 1/2 clinical data on ficlatuzumab in HNSCC, pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. We continue to evaluate opportunities for the further clinical development of ficlatuzumab in these and other cancers. 
Clinical Development of Ficlatuzumab in HNSCC
We announced results from the randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab, or the Phase 2 HNSCC Trial, in combination with ERBITUX® (cetuximab), an EGFR, targeted antibody, in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who relapsed or were refractory to prior immunotherapy, chemotherapy and cetuximab (pan-refractory) at the 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting. Based on the Phase 1b and Phase 2 clinical trial results, ficlatuzumab was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the evaluation of ficlatuzumab in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or recurrent HNSCC in September 2021.
In support of the proposed Phase 3 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab and cetuximab in patients with HPV negative HNSCC, in January 2022, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, or Merck, to evaluate ficlatuzumab in combination with cetuximab in patients with HPV negative R/M HNSCC. Merck will provide cetuximab clinical drug supply in all countries outside of the U.S. and Canada for the registrational clinical trial. We expect to continue to discuss potential registrational clinical trial designs with the FDA and with potential partners. Assuming the timely manufacturing of ficlatuzumab, the availability of financial resources or a strategic partner with adequate funding and the ability to finalize the trial design with the FDA under the Fast Track designation, we expect to initiate a potential registrational clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with cetuximab in patients with HPV negative HNSCC patients in the first half of 2023.
In 2020, we contracted with a CMO to manufacture the clinical supply for our potential Phase 3 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with cetuximab in patients with HPV negative R/M HNSCC patients. However, a shortage of required raw materials and manufacturing supplies also used in the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing process delayed the delivery of the clinical supply of ficlatuzumab. We have secured the required raw materials and manufacturing supplies and now plan to manufacture clinical supply for our potential Phase 3 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in the second quarter of 2022.
We continue to evaluate additional opportunities for the further clinical development of ficlatuzumab including in pancreatic cancer, AML and in tumors where EGFR inhibitors are used. The expansion of the ficlatuzumab clinical program, beyond what we are currently committed to, will require additional manufacturing efforts and costs. 
Clinical Development of Ficlatuzumab in Pancreatic Cancer
Kimberly Perez, M.D. at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute conducted an investigator-sponsored Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. The trial was initiated in December 2017 to test the safety and tolerability of ficlatuzumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer, or PDAC. In January 2020, results from the Phase 
1b portion of the trial were presented at the 2020 ASCO GI Cancers Symposium. The trial, which was based on preclinical findings demonstrating a synergistic effect of the combination in a preclinical model of PDAC, was designed to determine maximum tolerated dose of ficlatuzumab when combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Secondary outcome measures included ORR and PFS. A total of 24 patients enrolled in the trial. The average number of 28-day treatment cycles received was 7.5 (range 1-15), with three patients remaining on active treatment at the end of the trial. The combination showed a 29% partial response rate and a 92% disease control rate (partial response plus stable disease), which was promising relative to data observed for gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. Treatment with this regimen was associated with significant hypoalbuminemia and edema, and therefore a follow-up safety study is under consideration to evaluate ficlatuzumab in combination with an alternate cytotoxic regimen.
Clinical Development of Ficlatuzumab in AML
We conducted an investigator-sponsored Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with cytarabine in patients with AML, which we refer to as the CyFi-1 trial, which showed a complete response rate of 50% in the 18 primary refractory AML patients enrolled in the trial and an acceptable tolerability profile. Based on the promising findings from the CyFi-1 trial, we designed a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ficlatuzumab in combination with high-dose cytarabine versus high-dose cytarabine as a monotherapy in patients with AML, which we referred to as the CyFi-2 trial. However, in March 2020, we discontinued the CyFi-2 trial prior to the initiation of patient enrollment due to the urgent shift in priorities among clinical trial sites toward efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which had impacted the trial enrollment timeline and the feasibility of completing the clinical trial within the shelf-life of the ficlatuzumab clinical trial drug supply that was available. We are currently considering further clinical development of ficlatuzumab in AML, but have not made any final determinations at this time.
AV-380
AV-380 is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets growth differentiation factor 15, or GDF15, which is often associated with poor patient prognosis, the onset and worsening of cachexia and has been linked to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. We are developing AV-380 for the potential treatment and/or prevention of cancer cachexia. Cachexia is defined as a multi-factorial syndrome of involuntary weight loss characterized by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment. It is estimated that cachexia affects approximately 9 million individuals in North America, Europe and Japan. Cachexia is associated with various cancers, and it is estimated that 50% to 80% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia and up to 20% of all cancer patients die due to cachexia. We believe AV-380 has the potential to address a significant unmet medical need. Cachexia also affects patients with chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anorexia nervosa, AIDS and other diseases. 
In December 2020, the FDA approved our investigational new drug, or IND, application for AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia. In October 2021, we completed enrollment for a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects. Initial data observed a reduction of GDF15 in subjects and no drug related adverse events were identified. However, operational errors at the trial site have caused data integrity concerns and we have notified the FDA. We plan to discuss with the FDA the suitability of the data for regulatory purposes and our ability to publish the data from this trial. We do not expect the data quality issues in the Phase 1 clinical trial to impact our plans to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial in cancer patients in the second half of 2022.
We believe that AV-380 represents a unique approach to treating cachexia because, in preclinical studies, it has demonstrated the ability to address key mechanisms underlying the syndrome. Our preclinical research suggests that greater than 70% of cancer patients have increased GDF15 expression, starting at the pre-cachectic stage. If GDF15 inhibitors, such as AV-380, can demonstrate a clinically meaningful impact on cachexia, we believe there is a significant market opportunity with potential application in multiple tumor types in combination with current standards of care for oncology. In addition to our patents and patent applications covering our proprietary AV-380 antibody program, we have in-licensed certain patents and patent applications from St. Vincent’s Hospital Sydney Limited in Sydney, Australia, which we refer to as St. Vincent’s. We have milestone and royalty payment obligations under our license agreement with St. Vincent’s.
AV-203
AV-203 is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3 (also known as HER3). AV-203 inhibits ErbB3 inducing the internalization and degradation of the surface receptor and demonstrates a high degree of activity in NRG1+ tumors. AV-203 has also demonstrated a high degree of anti-tumor activity in preclinical models.
In March 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge Life Sciences Ltd., or CANbridge, which we refer to as the CANbridge Agreement, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203 in all countries outside of North America.
In September 2021, we regained worldwide rights to the AV-203 program following CANbridge's' termination of the CANbridge Agreement for convenience. As part of the termination for convenience, CANbridge transferred to us all of its know-how in the development of AV-203 as well as all manufacturing material. We are exploring AV-203 as a potential oncology treatment and we expect to reactivate the IND application in the second quarter of 2022.
ErbB3 Antibody Radio-Conjugate
In February 2022, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Actinium, to develop and study a first-in-class antibody radio-conjugate, or ARC, targeting ErbB3, also known as HER3. Actinium plans to utilize its Antibody Warhead Enabling, or AWE, technology platform to conjugate AVEO’s ErbB3 targeted antibody with the potent alpha-emitting radioisotope Actinium-225, or Ac-225, to form a novel Ac-225 ErbB3 targeted radiotherapy.
AV-353
AV-353 is a preclinical selective and potent IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the Notch 3 pathway. The Notch 3 pathway is important in cell-to-cell communication involving gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple cell differentiation processes during the entire life cycle. Scientific literature has implicated the Notch 3 receptor pathway in multiple diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, and neurodegenerative conditions. We are exploring AV-353 as a potential oncology treatment. AV-353 is being studied by our collaborators at the Mayo Clinic in preclinical studies of triple negative breast cancer.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage with respect to our product candidates.
Our core competitors include pharmaceutical and biotech organizations, as well as academic research institutions, clinical research laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities in the same therapeutic areas as us. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Additionally, many competitors have greater experience in oncology commercialization, product discovery and development and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, which may provide them with a competitive advantage.
We believe that our ability to compete will depend on our ability to execute on the following objectives:
•commercialize products that provide certain advantages over other products in the market in terms of, among other things, safety, efficacy and/or convenience;
•obtain favorable reimbursement, formulary and guideline status;
•design and develop products that are superior to other products in the market in terms of, among other things, safety, efficacy and/or convenience;
•obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates;
•obtain required regulatory approvals; and 
•collaborate with others in the design, development and commercialization of our products and product candidates.
Established competitors may invest heavily to discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product or our product candidates obsolete. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and/or safety in order to obtain approval, to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.
Tivozanib 
The competitive landscape and treatment regimens for RCC and HCC continue to rapidly evolve, particularly given the entrance of ICI combination therapies as well as other novel targets. The utilization of such regimens may affect sequencing of certain drugs and combinations across different lines of therapy. As such, it is difficult to predict how these developments will impact the tivozanib competitive landscape in RCC in the future.
To date, we believe the key competitors for FOTIVDA in relapsed or refractory advanced RCC include the following FDA-approved treatments: Cabometyx (cabozantinib), marketed by Exelixis, Inc.; Afinitor (everolimus), marketed by Novartis International Pharmaceutical, Ltd., or Novartis; Inlyta (axitinib), marketed by Pfizer Inc.; Opdivo (nivolumab), marketed by BMS, all as single-agent therapies; along with the combination of Lenvima (lenvatinib), marketed by Eisai Co., Ltd. and Novartis’ Afinitor (everolimus).
The kidney cancer market is very competitive with multiple mechanisms and combinations evolving at a rapid rate. However, we believe we are differentiated among competitors based on FOTIVDA's product properties and our clinical data set which positions us well in the relapsed or refractory advanced RCC market and supports our belief that FOTIVDA could become a standard of care in the United States in the third and fourth line relapsed or refractory advanced RCC setting. We are seeking to leverage tivozanib's differentiated product profile in combination with immunotherapy ICIs and other emerging targets, such as HIF2α, to further our market opportunities in RCC and other indications. 
Ficlatuzumab
We believe the products that currently compete with ficlatuzumab are primarily those that are approved and in development that target the HGF/cMET pathway. In particular, we are focused on targeting the HGF/CMET pathway in the HNSCC setting. To our knowledge, we are the only HNSCC therapy that targets the HGF/CMET pathway focused exclusively on the HPV negative HNSCC population. 
AV-380 
We believe the products that currently compete with our AV-380 program are primarily those that target the GDF15/GDNF Family Receptor Alpha Like, or GFRAL, pathway. A number of agents with unique mechanisms of action are in various stages of clinical development in cancer cachexia or wasting syndrome. We believe the key competitors for our AV-380 program are other companies pursuing the GDF15/GFRAL pathway for cancer cachexia and/or as an anti-cancer therapeutic, including NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer and CatalYm GmbH’s clinical GDF15 program.
AV-203
We believe the products that currently compete with our AV-203 program are monoclonal antibodies that specifically target the ErbB3 receptor. The clinical stage agents that are known to target ErbB3 receptors include Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.’s and Amgen Inc.’s patritumab (AMG-888), Elevation Oncology’s seribantumab, Merus N.V.’s MCLA-128, AstraZeneca’s sapitinib, Celldex Therapeutics Inc.’s CDX-3379, Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd.’s pirotinib and Roche’s duligotuzumab. 
AV-353
Currently, we are not aware of any ongoing clinical trials of Notch 3-specific inhibitors, nor any approved Notch 3-specific inhibitors in oncology; however, a number of agents for applications in oncology are being explored that target the Notch 3 receptor and may inhibit other Notch receptors.
Collaboration Agreements
We have established collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies for the further development of tivozanib and ficlatuzumab. As part of our corporate strategy, our collaborations advance life-cycle development for FOTIVDA (tivozanib) to support its potential utility in immuno-oncology and other combinations in RCC and other indications. We expect to continue to leverage our existing and enter into new strategic collaborations and partnerships that can contribute to our ability to efficiently develop our product candidates to provide a better life for patients with cancer. 
Tivozanib
BMS
In January 2021, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement, or the BMS Agreement, with BMS. Under the terms of the BMS Agreement, BMS is supplying OPDIVO® (nivolumab), its anti-PD-1 therapy, for the TiNivo-2 trial with FOTIVDA® (tivozanib) in RCC patients who have progressed following one or two lines of prior immunotherapy, one of which must include an ICI. Pursuant to the terms of the BMS Agreement, BMS granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide (other than within certain territories specified therein), non-transferable, royalty-free license under certain BMS patent rights, technology and regulatory documentation to use nivolumab in research and development, solely to the extent necessary to conduct the TiNivo-2 trial. Additionally, BMS granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide (other than 
within certain territories specified therein), non-transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free license under certain patent rights, technology and regulatory documentation, to seek regulatory approval of tivozanib for use in a combined therapy in the field, and, upon any such regulatory approval, to market and promote tivozanib solely for use in a combined therapy in the field in any manner that is consistent with the regulatory approval for tivozanib. Finally, BMS granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide (other than within certain territories specified therein), non-transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the field under certain inventions and patent rights relating to nivolumab for all purposes in the field except to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell offer for sale, export or import nivolumab or any biosimilar version. We and BMS shall jointly own all inventions, or the Combined Therapy Inventions, and patent rights, or the Combined Therapy Patent Rights, relating to the combined therapy used in the TiNivo-2 trial. We and BMS each may freely exploit the Combined Therapy Inventions and Combined Therapy Patent Rights, and the parties will share equally in costs relating to maintaining and prosecuting the Combined Therapy Patent Rights.
Pursuant to the terms of the BMS Agreement, each party is responsible for expenses relating to the manufacturing and supply of its respective products. For expenses related to conduct of the TiNivo-2 trial: (i) we will be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs associated with the performance of the TiNivo-2 trial, and (ii) each party will be responsible for its own internal costs associated with the TiNivo-2 trial. If the conduct of the TiNivo-2 trial requires a third-party license payment, then the party required to make such payment shall be determined in accordance with the prior sentence.
The term of the BMS Agreement will continue, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the BMS Agreement, until completion of the TiNivo-2 trial by all centers participating in the TiNivo-2 trial, delivery of all study data, including all completed case report forms, all final analyses and all final clinical study reports contemplated by the TiNivo-2 trial to both parties, and the completion of any statistical analyses and bioanalyses contemplated by the protocol or otherwise agreed to by the Parties to be conducted under the BMS Agreement.
AstraZeneca
In December 2018, we entered into a clinical supply agreement, the AstraZeneca Agreement, with a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1, in combination with tivozanib, in the DEDUCTIVE trial to treat HCC. Under the terms of the clinical supply agreement, we are the study sponsor and each party contributes the clinical supply of its study drug. Key decisions are made by both parties by consensus and external study costs are otherwise shared equally.
Ficlatuzumab
Biodesix
In April 2014, we entered into a worldwide co-development and collaboration agreement, or the Biodesix Agreement, with Biodesix to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab. Under the terms of the Biodesix Agreement, each party contributed 50% of all clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other costs to develop ficlatuzumab and to share equally in any future revenue and development or commercialization. Under the Biodesix Agreement, prior to the first commercial sale of ficlatuzumab, each party had the right to elect to discontinue its funding obligation for further development or commercialization efforts with respect to ficlatuzumab in exchange for reduced economics in the program, which is referred to as an “Opt-Out.” In September 2020, Biodesix exercised its "Opt-Out" rights under the Biodesix Agreement and, in December 2020, we regained full global rights to ficlatuzumab.
Pursuant to the terms of the Biodesix Agreement, as a result of Biodesix’s election to Opt-Out, Biodesix will (i) continue to be responsible for reimbursement of development costs with respect to the ongoing phase 2 investigator-sponsored clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with ERBITUX® (cetuximab) in HNSCC, or the Phase 2 HNSCC Trial, (ii) cease to be entitled to 50% sharing of profits resulting from commercialization of ficlatuzumab, (iii) be entitled to a low double digit royalty on future product sales and 25% of future licensing revenue (excluding contributions to research and development expenses), less approximately $2.5 million that Biodesix would be required to pay to us pursuant to the October 2016 amendment to the Biodesix Agreement and (iv) remain responsible for development obligations under the Biodesix Agreement with respect to VeriStrat®.
We and Biodesix also remain obligated to negotiate a commercialization agreement to delineate our respective rights and obligations in the event of any commercialization of VeriStrat® with ficlatuzumab. As a result of Biodesix’s decision to Opt-Out, we now have worldwide licensing rights and sole decision-making authority with respect to further development and commercialization of ficlatuzumab. The payment obligations between the parties under the Biodesix Agreement are in effect until completion of the Phase 2 HNSCC Trial.
License Agreements
As part of our corporate strategy, we have entered into license agreements to develop the programs in our portfolio and commercialize FOTIVDA in the EUSA territory. Under each of our license agreements, we are entitled to receive or required to pay upfront, milestone payments and/or royalties. 
Tivozanib 
Kyowa Kirin Co.
In December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with KKC, or the KKC Agreement, under which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable license to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in all territories in the world except for Asia and the Middle East, where KKC retained the rights to tivozanib. Under the KKC Agreement, we obtained exclusive rights to tivozanib in our territory under certain KKC patents, patent applications and know-how for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of all human diseases and conditions. In August 2019, we entered into an amendment to the KKC Agreement pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement. We have upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to KKC under the KKC Agreement, and following the amendment, KKC also has upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to us related to non-oncology development by KKC in our territory. Pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC was required to make a non-refundable upfront payment to us in the amount of $25.0 million that we received in September 2019 and KKC waived a one-time milestone payment of $18.0 million otherwise payable by us in March 2021 upon our obtaining marketing approval for tivozanib in the United States. 
If we sublicense any of our rights to tivozanib to a third-party, as we have done with EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, we are required to pay KKC a fixed 30% of the amounts we receive from our sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts we receive in respect of research and development reimbursement payments or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. 
Certain research and development reimbursement payments by EUSA are not subject to sublicense revenue payments to KKC. For example, if EUSA elects to opt-in to the TIVO-3 trial, the additional research and development reimbursement payment from EUSA of 50% of the total trial costs, up to $20.0 million, would also not be subject to a sublicense revenue payment to KKC, subject to certain limitations. We would, however, owe KKC 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, including reimbursement approvals for RCC in up to five specified EU countries, marketing approvals for RCC in three specified non-EU licensed territories, EU marketing approval filings and corresponding marketing approvals by the EMA for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, and sales-based milestones and royalties. The $2.0 million milestone payments we earned in each of February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019 upon EUSA’s reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA as a first-line treatment for RCC in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, respectively, were subject to the 30% KKC sublicense fee, or $0.6 million each.
We are also required to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales we make of FOTIVDA in our North American territory, which range from the low to mid-teens as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing FOTIVDA sales. Our royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of FOTIVDA in that country, and end on the later of 12 years after the date of the first commercial sale of FOTIVDA in that country or the date of the last to expire of the patents covering tivozanib that have been issued in that country. 
Pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC is also required to make milestone payments to us of up to an aggregate of $390.7 million upon the successful achievement of certain development and sales milestones of tivozanib in non-oncology indications. In August 2020, KKC paid us a $2.8 million development milestone upon acceptance by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan of KKC’s IND for a non-oncology formulation of tivozanib. In September 2020, KKC initiated clinical development of KHK4951, the reformulated tivozanib, in healthy volunteers and patients with Wet AMD. 
In addition, KKC is required to make tiered royalty payments to us on net sales of tivozanib in non-oncology indications in our territory, which range from high single digit to low double digits as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing tivozanib sales, subject to certain adjustments. KKC’s royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country, and end on the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim of a patent application or patent owned by KKC covering tivozanib or 10 years after the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in non-oncology indications in that country.
If KKC sublicenses any of its non-oncology rights to tivozanib to a third-party, KKC is required to pay us a percentage of amounts received from the respective sublicensees related to our territory, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts received in respect of research and development reimbursement payments or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. 
We and KKC each have access to and can benefit from the other party’s clinical data and regulatory filings with respect to tivozanib and biomarkers identified in the conduct of activities under the KKC Agreement, as related to oncology development. Under the KKC Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our territory.
The KKC Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless terminated earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the KKC Agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, KKC can terminate the KKC Agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to tivozanib and an obligation to assign or license to KKC any intellectual property or other rights we may have in tivozanib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for tivozanib. 
EUSA
In December 2015, we entered into the EUSA Agreement under which we granted to EUSA the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa and Australasia for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. EUSA is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize tivozanib throughout its licensed territories for RCC. EUSA has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories. In December 2021, EUSA announced that it had signed an agreement with Recordati, S.p.A. to be acquired and has indicated that the acquisition is anticipated to close in the first half of 2022.
We are also eligible to receive a research and development reimbursement payment from EUSA of $20 million of our total TIVO-3 trial costs if EUSA chooses to opt-in to use the TIVO-3 dataset to seek an expanded RCC indication in the EU, or for other regulatory or commercialization purposes. The leadership of EUSA has informed us that it is interested in exercising its opt-in right with respect to our TIVO-3 data and seeking an expanded label under the EUSA Agreement, but has requested we delay the negotiations regarding the structuring of this payment stream until the acquisition by Recordati, S.p.A. closes. We cannot be certain that we will arrive at mutually acceptable terms, or that EUSA will ultimately exercise the opt-in.
We are entitled to receive milestone payments of $2.0 million per country upon reimbursement approval, if any, for RCC in each of countries in the EU5 and, to date, we have received payments upon reimbursement approval for RCC in the UK (February 2018), Germany (November 2018) and Spain (February 2019). We are also entitled to receive $2.0 million for the grant of marketing approval for RCC, if any, in three of the licensed countries outside of the EU, as mutually agreed by the parties, the first two of which were obtained in New Zealand in July 2019 and in South Africa in September 2020. 
We are also eligible to receive a payment of $2.0 million per indication in connection with a filing by EUSA with the EMA for marketing approval, if any, for tivozanib for the treatment of each of up to three additional indications and $5.0 million per indication in connection with the EMA’s grant of marketing approval for each of up to three additional indications, as well as up to $335.0 million upon EUSA’s achievement of certain sales thresholds. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales, if any, of licensed products in its licensed territories ranging from a low double digit up to mid-twenty percent depending on the level of annual net sales. In November 2017, we began earning sales royalties upon EUSA’s commencement of the first commercial launch of FOTIVDA (tivozanib) with the initiation of product sales in Germany. EUSA has received reimbursement approval for and commercially launched FOTIVDA in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain as well as in additional non-EU5 countries. 
The research and development reimbursement payments under the EUSA Agreement are not subject to the 30% sublicensing payment payable to KKC, subject to certain limitations. We would, however, owe KKC 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, including any reimbursement approvals for RCC in the EU5, marketing approvals for RCC in three specified non-EU licensed territories, EU marketing approval filings and corresponding marketing approvals by the EMA for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, and sales-based milestones and royalties, as set forth above. The $2.0 million milestone payments we earned in each of February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019 upon EUSA’s reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, respectively, were subject to the 30% KKC sublicense fee, or $0.6 million, each.
The term of the EUSA Agreement continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the last to occur of (a) the expiration of the last valid patent claim for such product in such country, (b) the expiration of market or regulatory data exclusivity for such product in such country or (c) the tenth anniversary of the effective date. Either party may terminate the EUSA Agreement in the event of the bankruptcy of the other party or a material breach by the other party that remains uncured, following receipt of written notice of such breach, for a period of (a) thirty (30) days in the case of breach for nonpayment of any amount due under the EUSA Agreement, and (b) ninety (90) days in the case of any other material breach. EUSA may terminate the EUSA Agreement at any time upon one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice. In addition, we may terminate the EUSA Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice if EUSA challenges any of the patent rights licensed under the EUSA Agreement. EUSA has reported to us that, to date, it has not experienced any material decrease in sales trends or interruptions in supply or distribution of FOTIVDA during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FOTIVDA sales is difficult to predict.
AV-380
St. Vincent’s Hospital 
In July 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Vincent’s, or the St. Vincent’s Agreement, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize products for therapeutic applications that benefit from inhibition or decreased expression or activity of MIC-1, which is also known as GDF15. Under the St. Vincent’s Agreement, we have non-exclusive rights to certain related diagnostic products and research tools and also have a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to certain improvements that St. Vincent’s or third parties may make to licensed therapeutic products. We are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct research and clinical development and commercially launch at least one licensed therapeutic product.
As of December 31, 2021, we are required to make future milestone payments, up to an aggregate total of $14.4 million, upon the earlier of the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double digit percentage rate for milestone payments made after we grant any sublicense, depending on the sublicensed territory. In February 2022, the Company paid a $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation that became due to St. Vincent’s in January 2022. 
The St. Vincent’s Agreement remains in effect until the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of licensed therapeutic products in the last country in which a commercial sale is made, or expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents, unless we elect, or St. Vincent’s elects, to terminate the St. Vincent’s Agreement earlier. We have the right to terminate the St. Vincent’s Agreement on six months’ notice if we terminate our GDF15 research and development programs as a result of the failure of a licensed therapeutic product in preclinical or clinical development, or if we form the reasonable view that further GDF15 research and development is not commercially viable, and we are not then in breach of any of our obligations under the St. Vincent’s Agreement. 
AV-203
CANbridge
In March 2016, we entered into the CANbridge Agreement under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203, a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3 (also known as HER3), for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in all countries outside of North America. In December 2017, CANbridge filed an IND application with the National Medical Products Administration (formerly, the China Food and Drug Administration), or NMPA, for a clinical study of AV-203 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, or ESCC. In August 2018, CANbridge obtained regulatory approval of its IND application from the NMPA for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC. In March 2021, CANbridge exercised its right to terminate the CANbridge Agreement for convenience. Under the terms of the CANbridge Agreement, the transfer of the AV-203 program was completed in September 2021 and we regained worldwide rights to the AV-203 program. As part of the transfer, CANbridge transferred to us all of its know-how in the development of AV-203 as well as any remaining manufacturing material. We expect to reactivate the IND in the second quarter of 2022.

A percentage of any milestone and royalty payments received by us under future partnership agreements related to the AV-203 program, excluding upfront and reimbursement payments, are due to Biogen Idec International GmbH, or Biogen, as a sublicensing fee under our option and license agreement with Biogen dated March 18, 2009, as amended.
Biogen Idec International GmbH
In March 2009, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Biogen regarding the development and commercialization of our discovery-stage ErbB3-targeted antibodies, including AV-203, for the potential treatment and diagnosis of cancer and other diseases outside of North America, or the Biogen Agreement. Under the Biogen Agreement, we are responsible for developing ErbB3 antibodies through completion of the first Phase 2 clinical trial designed in a manner that, if successful, would generate data sufficient to support advancement to a Phase 3 clinical trial.
In March 2014, we and Biogen amended the Biogen Agreement, or the Biogen Amendment. Pursuant to the Biogen Amendment, Biogen agreed to the termination of its rights and obligations under the Biogen Agreement, including Biogen’s option to (i) obtain a co-exclusive (with us) worldwide license to develop and manufacture ErbB3 targeted antibodies and (ii) obtain exclusive commercialization rights to ErbB3 products in countries in the world other than North America. As a result, we have worldwide rights to AV-203. Pursuant to the Biogen Amendment, we are obligated to use reasonable efforts to seek a collaboration partner for the purpose of funding further development and commercialization of ErbB3 targeted antibodies. We are also obligated to pay Biogen a percentage of milestone payments received by us from future partnerships after March 28, 2016 and single digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of ErbB3 products, if any, up to a cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million.
Intellectual Property Rights 
Patent Rights
We continue to build a strong intellectual property portfolio, and, whenever possible, we seek to have multiple tiers of patent protection for our product candidates.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. A U.S. patent term may be shortened, if a patent is terminally disclaimed by its owner, over another patent.
The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for a patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We have applied for patent term extensions on patents covering tivozanib and expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering any of our product candidates that may obtain FDA approval in the future.
We rely on, and in the future expect to rely on, a combination of both patent protection and regulatory exclusivities to protect our approved products from generic or biosimilar competition. With the exception of pediatric exclusivities (a regulatory exclusivity), patent and regulatory exclusivities typically run concurrently with one another. Patents covering our approved products and product candidates are discussed below. Regulatory exclusivities relating to our approved products are discussed in the following section entitled “Government Regulation and Product Approval – Generic Drugs.” 
Tivozanib
With respect to tivozanib, we have exclusively licensed from KKC its patents that cover the molecule and its therapeutic use for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of any and all oncologic diseases and conditions in humans and a crystal form of the molecule. As discussed in “—Strategic Partnerships—Tivozanib–Kyowa Kirin Co. (KKC)” above, pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement in August 2019, KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights of tivozanib in our licensed territories, excluding the rights which are currently sublicensed to EUSA.
With respect to tivozanib, we have the following in-licensed patents:
•U.S.: 2 granted patents expiring in 2023
•Europe: 2 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2022 to 2023
•Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2022
•Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2022
With respect to the U.S. patents, the first patent covers the tivozanib molecule and its therapeutic use and was originally scheduled to expire in April 2022. On January 22, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted a one-year interim patent term extension of this patent until April 2023. If our application for patent term extension is granted, this one year interim extension will be included in the maximum patent term extension granted for this patent. The second patent covers a crystalline form of tivozanib that is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our tivozanib product 
candidate and is expected to expire in November 2023. In view of the length of time that tivozanib has been under regulatory review at the FDA, a patent term extension of up to five years may be available under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Although we have applied for patent term extensions on each patent, only one patent may be extended, and, when appropriate, we will have to elect which patent is to be extended. If a five year term extension were to be granted, if applied to the first patent, the term could be extended to April 2027, and if applied to the second patent, the term could be extended to November 2028. 
With respect to the European patents, Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, have been granted for the European patent covering the tivozanib molecule in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom extending the term of the patents in each of these countries up to April 2027. An SPC application is pending in Denmark for the corresponding Danish patent that covers the tivozanib molecule, which, if granted, could extend the term of the patent up to 2027. An SPC has been granted for the patent covering the crystalline form of tivozanib in Ireland extending the term of that patent to October 2028. 
Additionally, we have filed patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions including Australia, Canada and Europe directed to our clinical protocol for using tivozanib to treat refractory cancers, including, following therapy with checkpoint inhibitors, which, if granted, would each expire in 2039. 
Ficlatuzumab
With respect to our anti-HGF platform, including ficlatuzumab, we have six U.S. patents covering our anti-HGF antibodies, nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the antibodies, host cells, methods of making the antibodies, and methods of treatment using the antibodies. In addition, we have filed an international (PCT) application directed to treating head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with ficlatuzumab. If nationalized, we expect that a patent granted on a patent application in this family would expire in 2041. With respect to our anti-HGF platform we have:
•U.S.: 6 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2027 to 2028
•Europe: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
•Japan: 2 granted patents expiring in 2027
•Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
•Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
•PCT: 1 pending PCT application, which if nationalized and granted would expire in 2041
AV-380 Platform
With respect to our anti-GDF15 platform, including AV-380, we have exclusively licensed certain patent rights from St. Vincent’s, which include a granted U.S. patent directed to a method of increasing appetite and/or body weight upon administering an effective amount of an anti-GDF15 antibody, which is expected to expire in 2029.
With respect to the licensed patent rights, we have:
•U.S.: 1 granted patent, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2025 to 2029
•Europe: 2 granted patents expiring in 2025
•Japan: 2 granted patents expiring in 2025
•Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2025
•Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2025
Additionally, we own three issued U.S. patents and a pending U.S. patent application covering our anti-GDF15 antibodies and methods of treating cachexia and inhibiting loss of muscle mass associated with cachexia using our anti-GDF15 antibodies. These patents and patent application, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2033. 
We also have three pending U.S. patent applications directed to methods of treating or preventing congestive heart failure or chronic kidney disease using an anti-GDF15 antibody, and methods of treating a subject with cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome with an anti-cancer agent and an anti-GDF15 antibody. These patent applications, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2035.
With respect to our anti-GDF15 platform, we have:
•U.S.: 3 granted patents, and 4 pending patent applications, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2035
•Europe: 4 granted patents, and 4 pending patent applications, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2035; one of the granted patents has been opposed in the European Patent Office
•Japan: 3 granted patents, and 2 pending patent applications, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2035
•Canada: 2 pending patent applications, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2035
•Australia: 2 granted patents, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2035
AV-203 Platform
With respect to our anti-ErbB3 platform, including AV-203, we have five issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application covering our anti-ErbB3 antibodies, nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the antibodies, host cells, methods of making the antibodies and methods of treatment using our anti-ErbB3 antibodies, which are expected to expire from 2031 to 2032.

•U.S.: 5 granted patents, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
•Europe: 2 granted patents, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
•Japan: 3 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
•Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2031
•Australia: 3 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
AV-353 Platform
With respect to our AV-353 platform, we own three issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications covering our anti-Notch3 antibodies, nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the antibodies, host cells, methods of making the antibodies and methods of treatment using the antibodies. The three issued U.S. patents and the two non-provisional U.S. patent applications, if granted, would be expected to have expirations ranging from 2033 to 2037. 
With respect to our AV-353 platform, we have:
•U.S.: 3 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2037, and 2 pending patent applications, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2037
•Europe: 1 granted patent expiring in 2033, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, expiring in 2037
Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of oncology and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. With regard to ficlatuzumab, we are aware of one United States patent and its foreign counterparts that contain broad claims related to anti-HGF antibodies having certain binding properties and their use. In the event that the owner of these patents were to bring an infringement action against us, we may have to argue that our product, its manufacture or use does not infringe a valid claim of the patent in question. Furthermore, if we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent. This means that in, order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent’s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity.
Over the years, we have found it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders. Where licenses are readily available at reasonable cost, such licenses are considered a normal cost of doing business. In other instances, however, we may have used the results of freedom-to-operate studies to guide our research away from areas where we believed we were likely to encounter obstacles in the form of third-party intellectual property. For example, where a third-party holds relevant intellectual property and is a direct competitor, a license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or available at all.
In spite of our efforts to avoid obstacles and disruptions arising from third-party intellectual property, it is impossible to establish with certainty that our technology platform or our product programs will be free of claims by third-party intellectual property holders. Even with modern databases and on-line search engines, literature searches are imperfect and may fail to identify relevant patents and published applications. Even when a third-party patent is identified, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, patent litigation may be initiated against us. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be quantified in advance, for example, the credibility of expert witnesses who may disagree on technical interpretation of scientific data. Ultimately, in the case of an adverse outcome in litigation, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or using certain aspects of our technology platform as a result of patent infringement claims asserted against us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business.
To protect our competitive position, it may be necessary to enforce our patent rights through litigation against infringing third parties. Litigation to enforce our own patent rights is subject to the same uncertainties discussed above. In addition, however, litigation involving our patents carries the risk that one or more of our patents will be held invalid (in whole or in part, on a claim-by-claim basis) or held unenforceable. Such an adverse court ruling could allow third parties to commercialize our products or our platform technology, and then compete directly with us, without making any payments to us.
Trademarks
We seek trademark protection in the United States and other jurisdictions where available and when appropriate. We have filed applications and obtained registrations for several trademarks intended for use in the marketing of tivozanib, including the trademark FOTIVDA, which we have registered in the United States and over 35 other jurisdictions, and for which we have filed applications in additional countries. We own U.S. and EU registrations for a logo containing FOTIVDA in combination with a flame design. We own U.S. registrations for AVEO and AVEO (in stylized letters) trademarks that we use in connection with our business in general. We have also registered AVEO as a trademark in over 20 other jurisdictions.
Manufacturing
We or our partners currently contract with and rely on third parties for the manufacture of our commercial product and product candidates and intend to do so in the future for both commercial and clinical needs. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial or clinical quantities of our commercial product or product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own commercial scale or clinical manufacturing capabilities. Although we rely on third-party contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers. All manufacturing occurs at facilities that are required to comply with FDA requirements and the requirements of regulatory agencies from the other jurisdictions where we have obtained approval.

FOTIVDA (tivozanib). One of our contract manufacturers has manufactured what we believe to be sufficient quantities of tivozanib drug product (capsules) to support our ongoing and planned commercialization and clinical trials. A separate contract manufacturer, using our proprietary manufacturing process, has manufactured what we believe to be sufficient lots of drug substance. This drug substance may be used to manufacture tivozanib drug product (capsules) for any future commercial and clinical needs. 

We engage a separate contract manufacturer to bottle, package, label and serialize commercial supply of FOTIVDA on an as-needed basis and we rely on a separate third-party to distribute commercial supply of FOTIVDA in the United States. 

Ficlatuzumab. Through a separate third-party contract manufacturer, we have initiated the clinical manufacture of ficlatuzumab to supply a potential registrational clinical trial in HNSCC and to enable additional potential development in pancreatic cancer and AML. However, a shortage of required key raw materials and manufacturing supplies also used in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing process has delayed the delivery of the clinical supply of ficlatuzumab. We have secured the key required raw materials and manufacturing supplies and now plan to manufacture ficlatuzumab Phase 3 clinical supply in the second quarter of 2022.
AV-380. We currently have sufficient clinical trial drug supply for AV-380 to support our planned clinical trials. The same contract manufacturer we engaged to initiate clinical manufacturing of ficlatuzumab will be manufacturing any future clinical supply needs for AV-380. Our CMO for AV-380 has experienced employee shortages, supply chain issues and disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic which has delayed and may continue to delay manufacturing of AV-380.

Despite the delays to ficlatuzumab and AV-380 manufacturing based on COVID-19 related issues, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our commercial and clinical supply of FOTIVDA (tivozanib) or our clinical supply of AV-203 to date. We currently have a sufficient supply of FOTIVDA (tivozanib) and AV-203 that we believe will meet our ongoing commercial and clinical needs for more than twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe there are alternate manufacturers with the capability to supply for current clinical or potential future commercial needs, contracting with additional contract manufacturers would require significant lead-times and result in additional costs and is not the solution we expect to follow. 
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, sales, pricing, reimbursement, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. 
The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs and Biologics in the United States

In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Biological products are licensed for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and subject to regulation under the FDCA and related regulations.
A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products, and their regulatory approval, is typically referred to as a sponsor. A sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug or biological product in the United States must typically complete each of the following steps:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards; 
•design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA for a drug candidate product and a biological licensing application, or BLA, for a biological product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
•review of the request for approval by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
•completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or similar foreign standards, which we refer to as cGMPs,to assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
•payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
Preclinical Studies
Before a sponsor begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the product candidate for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug or biologic that is not the subject of an approved NDA or BLA. In support of a request for an IND, a sponsor must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day 
waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available for expanded access. However, if a sponsor has a policy regarding how it responds to expanded access requests with respect to product candidates in development to treat serious diseases or conditions, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to 
make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study for a covered investigational product; or 15 days after the investigational product receives designation from the FDA as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA or BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. The FDA has issued regulations authorizing a sponsor to transfer certain responsibilities for the conduct of a clinical study to a CRO.
The clinical investigation of an investigational drug or biological product is generally divided into four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The four phases of an investigation are as follows:
•Phase 1. Phase 1 studies include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug or biological product into humans. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug or biological product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
•Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug or biological product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under trial, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug or biological product. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population.
•Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug or biological product has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug or biological product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
•Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
Further, in August 2018, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology biological product development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to product development and reduce developmental costs and time. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the 
following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Finally, sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. The NIH’s Final Rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017, and both NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues. 
Manufacturing and Other Regulatory Requirements
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
In addition, the FDA’s regulations require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and they are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. The FDA’s regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product. 
Pediatric Studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, applications and certain types of supplements to applications must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The sponsor and the FDA must reach agreement on a final plan. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
For investigational products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of a sponsor, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-Phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs 
to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. The law now requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. It further requires the FDA to publicly post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. The FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population.
Submission and Filing of an NDA or BLA with the FDA
In order to obtain approval to market a drug or biological product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for the proposed indication, and the safety, purity and potency of the biological product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product and the safety, purity and potency of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
The application is the vehicle through which sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA or BLA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is $3,117,218 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is $369,413. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. If an application is withdrawn prior to the FDA acceptance for filing, 75% of these fees may be refunded to the sponsor. If an application is withdrawn after filing, a lower portion of these fees may be refunded in certain circumstances.
Following submission of an NDA or BLA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor at that time or before whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing and the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs and BLAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the sponsor to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
In connection with its review of an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA or BLA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The scheduling and execution of such pre-approval inspections may be impacted or delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA
The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and whether it is effective for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. The FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to establish effectiveness of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional confirmatory information may satisfy this standard. The FDA will ultimately seek to determine whether the expected benefits of the product outweigh its potential risks to patients. This “benefit-risk” assessment is informed by the extensive body of evidence about the product’s safety and efficacy in the NDA or BLA.
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or an approval letter. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the sponsor an additional six month extension to respond.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. None of these programs changes the standards for approval but each may help expedite the development or approval process governing product candidates.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after 
preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
Finally, with passage of the Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Post-Approval Regulation
Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. The FDA's regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the sponsor to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the sponsor for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
Section 505(b)(2) thus authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Generic Drugs
In 1984, with the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, a sponsor must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. This interpretation of the FDCA by the FDA was confirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the sponsor may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the sponsor and are essential to the approval of the application.
As part of the submission of an NDA or certain supplemental applications, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the sponsor’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of a new drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. The FDA’s regulations governing patent listings were largely codified into law with enactment of the Orange Book Modernization Act in January 2021. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to make a certification to the FDA in connection with any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book. Specifically, the ANDA applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. Moreover, to the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant also is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the NDA-approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
If the generic drug or follow-on drug applicant does not challenge the innovator’s listed patents, FDA will not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new generic product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA owner and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA owner and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of seven and a half years from the date of approval of the NDA, expiration of the patent and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.
Biosimilars
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. Since enactment of the BPCIA, the FDA has approved numerous biosimilar products for use in the United States. In addition, the FDA approved the first interchangeable biosimilar product on July 30, 2021 and a second product previously approved as a biosimilar was designated as interchangeable in October 2021. The FDA has also issued numerous guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilar products.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA or BLA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications. If a drug or biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drug products that received orphan drug designation before enactment of amendments to the FDCA in 2017 but have not yet been approved by FDA.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity. For drug products, the six month exclusivity period may be attached to the term of any existing patent term or regulatory exclusivity. For biologic products, the six month period may only be attached to any existing regulatory exclusivities but not to any patent terms. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; 
rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND and the submission date of a NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. 
In April 2020, the FDA issued additional guidance which describes considerations for the development and labeling of companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products, when appropriate. The 2020 guidance expands on the policy statement in the 2014 guidance by recommending that companion diagnostic developers consider a number of factors when determining whether their test could be developed, or the labeling for approved companion diagnostics could be revised through a supplement, to support a broader labeling claim such as use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic products (rather than listing an individual therapeutic product(s)).
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 

The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the sponsor must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2022, the standard fee is $374,858 and the small business fee is $93,714.
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the EU
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. 
Clinical Trial Approval in the EU

On January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 became effective in the EU and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the EU, or EU Member State, will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the EMA and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public.
The new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the EU at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.

PRIME Designation in the EU
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level.
Marketing Authorization in the EU
In the EU, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the sponsor in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, a sponsor submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
A marketing authorization may be granted only to a sponsor established in the EU. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, a sponsor must demonstrate compliance with all 
measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
Regulatory Data Protection in the EU
In the EU, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the EU
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the sponsor must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for trial protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
Regulatory Requirements After Marketing Authorization in the EU
Following marketing authorization of a medicinal product in the EU, the holder of the authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting, as well as rules potentially requiring post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU took place on January 31, 2020. The EU and the U.K. reached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on January 1, 2021 and which entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the EU and the U.K. will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become inevitable as a consequence that the U.K. is no longer part of the single market. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU.
Furthermore, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for a transitional period during which the United Kingdom will be treated like an EU member state in relation to processing and transfers of personal data for four months from January 1, 2021. This may be extended by two further months. After such period, the United Kingdom will be a “third country” under the GDPR unless the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has already determined that it considers all of the EU 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. 
General Data Protection Regulation
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals who are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include: 

•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or the FCA, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

•Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; 

•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;

•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;

•the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;

•the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the ACA, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; and

•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by third-party payors, including private insurers.
Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and transfers of value to other health care providers and health care entities, or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and, on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have 
standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On January 28, 2021, however, President Biden rescinded those orders and issued a new executive order that directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit access to healthcare, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID‑19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and under the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.
In addition, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
There have been, and likely will continue to be, additional legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal, and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 114 full-time employees, which increased to 115 full-time employees as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of these employees, approximately half are members of our sales team. Our next largest functions after sales are our technical operations, medical affairs and commercial operations
