 Item 1. Business
About Korn Ferry 
 Korn/Ferry International (referred to herein as the Company, Korn Ferry, or in the first person notations we, our, and us) is the preeminent global people and organizational advisory firm. We opened our first office in Los Angeles in 1969 and currently operate in 114 offices in 53 countries. We have the ability to deliver our solutions on a global basis, wherever our clients do business. As of April 30, 2017, we had 7,232 full-time employees, including 1,330 consultants (517 Executive Search, 557 Hay Group (formerly known as Leadership & Talent Consulting (Legacy LTC) which was combined with HG (Luxembourg) S.à.r.l (Legacy Hay) in December 2015), and 256 Futurestep) who are primarily responsible for client services. Our clients include many of the worlds largest and most prestigious public and private companies, middle market and emerging growth companies, as well as government and nonprofit organizations. We have built strong client loyalty with 82% of our assignments performed during fiscal 2017 on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted assignments in the previous three fiscal years. We have made significant investments in our business with the acquisitions of PDI Ninth House and Global Novations in fiscal 2013, Pivot Leadership in fiscal 2015, and Legacy Hay in fiscal 2016. These acquisitions have strengthened our intellectual property, enhanced our geographical presence, added complimentary capabilities to further leverage search relationships and broadened the capabilities for assessment and development. They also improved our ability to support the global business community not only in attracting top talent and designing compensation and reward incentives, but also with an integrated approach to the entire leadership and people continuum. 
 We were originally formed as a California corporation in November 1969 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in fiscal 2000. 
 The Korn Ferry Opportunity 
 Historically, the Human Resources (HR) industry has offered piecemeal views of people based on inconsistent processes, technologies and measurement. Korn Ferry has assembled intellectual property which we bring to market through a holistic framework that sits at the intersection of an organizations strategy and its people. 
 Superior performance happens when an organization establishes the conditions for success and when the right people are enabled and engaged, sitting in the right seats and are developed and rewarded. We can help a client operationalize its business strategy through our six solution sets: 
 

Strategy Execution & Organization Design | We establish the conditions for success by clarifying strategy; designing an operating model and organization structure that aligns to it; and defining a high performance culture. We enable strategic change by engaging and motivating people to perform.
Talent Strategy and Work Design | We map talent strategy to business strategy and help organizations put their plan into action. We make sure they have the right people, in the right roles, engaged and enabled to do the right things. 
Rewards and Benefits | We help organizations align reward with strategy. We help them pay their people fairly for doing the right things  with rewards they value  at a cost the organization can afford. 
Assessment and Succession | We provide actionable, research-backed insights that allow organizations to understand the true capabilities of their people so they can make decisions that ensure the right leaders are ready  when and where they are needed  in the future.

Executive Search and Recruitment | We integrate scientific research with our practical experience and industry-specific expertise to recruit professionals of all levels and functions at organizations across every industry. 
Leadership Development | We activate purpose, vision, and strategy through leaders at all levels and organizations. We combine expertise, science, and proven techniques with forward thinking and creativity to build leadership experiences that help entry to senior-level leaders grow and deliver superior results.

About Our Intellectual Property and Technology 
 Korn Ferry is a knowledge-based company with deep intellectual property (IP) and research that allow us to deliver meaningful outcomes for our clients. 
 The Korn Ferry Institute, our research and analytics arm, unites the following areas: talent and organizational analytics, research and thought leadership, and assessment and IP development. These teams work together to leverage data and build IP in ways that give Korn Ferry a competitive advantage and a privileged understanding of how people and organizations can best achieve superior performance. 
 We do research that underpins our products and consulting services across Korn Ferrys three business lines, and supports our six solution sets in the service of solving our clients most complex business issues, from creating growth to becoming digitally sustainable to navigating mergers and acquisitions. Our vast library of proprietary tools and techniques has been acquired or developed through research by our social scientists, statisticians and IP development specialists. We have unique insight into what makes great leaders and how strategic talent decisions help contribute to competitive advantage and success. 
 Our talent data includes five million assessments, profiles of eight million candidates, reward data on twenty million professionals and engagement data on six million professionals. This database provides the insight and intelligence for Korn Ferrys team of social scientists and consultants to determine the true drivers of leadership, performance and value in the market and how any individual or organization measures up. Solutions leveraging this IP help to deliver on Korn Ferrys holistic framework that sits at the intersection of an organizations strategy and its people. 
 In fiscal 2017, the Korn Ferry Institute, in partnership with thought leaders across our business, established the Korn Ferry Superior Performance Model. This is a foundational framework that captures the key success factors that drive organizational performance. Divided into organizational enablers and people enablers, our research shows the relationship between the different levers that drive discretionary energy and financial performance. 
 In the fiscal year ahead, our IP strategy will be to: 
 

§ | Embed our Superior Performance Model framework into our consulting methodology with clients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Develop a compelling, research-based framework that brings together the vast people and organizational IP from the legacy firms and clearly describes what drives superior performance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Simplify and integrate our portfolio of products, solutions and data assets around this framework and;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Focus our innovation efforts on the areas within this framework to build differentiated offerings, leverage the vast amounts of data we have, and promote thought leadership that builds the brand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Leadership Assessment, Succession and Development will be core solution areas, where we have industry-leading capabilities and IP and significant competitive advantages including recognition as a market leader in leadership agility. The next frontier of agility will extend beyond individuals to the collective agility of teams and organizations. Given our newly acquired expertise from Legacy Hay in the area of Strategy Execution and Organization Design, we are now positioned to bring together the people and organizational aspects of agility, establish differentiated thought leadership and develop a distinctive solution. 
 In the area of Strategy Execution and Organization Design, we will fine-tune a new organizational diagnostic based on drivers of superior business performance that can be applied to the C-suite and cascaded down through an organization.

Within Rewards, we believe the market for total rewards strategies and approaches will remain strong, especially given the increased demand for pay parity. We are developing solutions, growing our rewards database and providing research-based thought leadership to assist organizations optimize the biggest expense item on their operating ledger. 
 Within Executive Search, we will continue to add more discipline and scientific research into the recruitment process, with emphasis shifting from candidate identification to candidate assessment, fit, attraction, engagement and rewards. Driving this focus is our enhanced technology as the power of the Internet, big data and online talent communities make it possible to efficiently identify greater numbers of qualified candidates. We will continue making enhancements to Korn Ferrys Four Dimensions of Leadership & Talent (KF4D), our talent assessment and analytics engine, including integrating new pay and work measurement IP from Legacy Hay. 
 Finally, we will further embed our IP into new and existing tools commercialized through Korn Ferrys Products Group, creating unique value for this growing business line that provides data, analytics and insight products that aid in recruiting, assessing, developing, engaging and rewarding talent. Examples of this include enhanced blended assessments that can be used in recruitment and talent management scenarios, and development targeted to success profiles for roles. 
 About Our Business Segments 
 Korn Ferry solutions and intellectual property are delivered through the following business segments: 
 Executive Search: Korn Ferry Executive Search helps clients attract the best executive talent for moving their companies in the right direction. The business is managed by geographical region leaders with a focus on recruiting board-level, chief executive and other senior executive positions for clients predominantly in the consumer, financial services, industrial, life sciences/healthcare provider, technology and educational/not-for-profit industries. We also have centers of functional expertise; our Board & CEO Services group, for example, focuses exclusively on placing CEOs and board of directors in organizations around the world. The relationships that we develop through this business allow us to add incremental value to our clients through the delivery of our other people and organizational advisory solutions. 
 Our executive search services concentrate on searches for positions with annual cash compensation of $300,000 or more, or comparable compensation in foreign locations, which may involve board-level, chief executive and other senior executive positions. The industry is comprised of retained and contingency recruitment firms. Retained firms, such as Korn Ferry, typically charge a fee for their services equal to approximately one-third of the first-year annual cash compensation for the position being filled regardless of whether the position is filled. Contingency firms generally work on a non-exclusive basis and are compensated only upon successfully placing a recommended candidate. 
 Hay Group: Korn Ferry Hay Group helps an organization to align its people to their strategy  developing, engaging, and rewarding them to reach new heights. We deliver this through a combination of solutions consulting and product services that addresses how people work, and how to nurture them so that strategies succeed. We capitalize on the breadth of our intellectual property, service offerings and expertise to do what is right for the client. Services are delivered by an experienced team of consultants and includes one of the richest and most comprehensive people data sets. 
 Futurestep: Korn Ferry Futurestep draws from Korn Ferrys four decades of recruitment experience to offer fully scalable, flexible services that help organizations attract top people while reducing costs and time to hire. Our portfolio of services includes Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), Project Recruitment, Professional Search, Talent Consulting and Employer Branding.

 Industry Trends 
 In this competitive global economic environment, our clients are seeking new pathways to drive sustainable profitable growth. CEOs are increasingly demanding an agile workforce that can innovate and drive growth across borders. We believe Korn Ferry is uniquely positioned to help leaders and organizations succeed by releasing the full power and potential of people. 
 Consolidation of Talent Management Solution Providers  In choosing recruitment and human resource service providers, we believe: 
 

§ | Companies are actively in search of preferred providers in order to create efficiencies and consolidate vendor relationships;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Companies that can offer a full suite of talent management solutions are becoming increasingly attractive; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Clients seek trusted advisors who understand their business and unique organizational culture in order to manage the multiple needs of their business on a global scale.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Skills Gaps  There are not enough highly skilled people coming into the labor market to fill open jobs. Particularly at the senior management levels, the available talent pool is inadequate. New leaders must step into bigger, more complex, and more global roles faster  and with less experience  than their predecessors. Given this, learning agility  ones ability to solve complex problems, easily adapt in a constantly changing world and drive change  is more important than ever. We believe employers will increasingly seek service providers who can help them find, develop and retain highly qualified, learning agile talent that secures a competitive advantage.
Human Capital is One of the Top CEO Challenges  The people, the minds, the alliances and the culture that can create and then nurture innovative ideas  are seen as central to CEOs. In fact, according to The Conference Board, human capital  how best to develop, engage, manage and retain talent  is the single biggest challenge facing CEOs in 2017.
Talent Analytics  Companies are increasingly leveraging big data and predictive analytics to measure the influence of activities across all aspects of their business, including HR. They expect their service providers to deliver superior metrics and better ways of communicating results. Korn Ferrys go-to-market approach is increasingly focused on talent analytics. Leveraging a large set of data on talent accumulated over decades of research, we have cataloged the elements of talent and isolated the most potent facets. The result, Korn Ferrys Four Dimensions of Leadership & Talent, is the talent intelligence engine that powers many of our solutions and products. Within our Hay Group segment, we also possess several of the richest HR databases in the world, so our clients can benchmark salaries, leadership potential, employee engagement, organizational culture and other HR data by industry at a global and country level. 
 Increased Outsourcing of Recruitment Functions  More companies are focusing on core competencies and outsourcing non-core, back-office functions to providers who can provide efficient, high-quality services. Third-party providers can apply immediate and long-term approaches for improving all aspects of talent acquisition. Advantages to outsourcing part or all of the recruitment function include:

§ | Access to a diverse and highly qualified pool of candidates, which is refreshed on a regular basis;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

§ | Reduction or elimination of the costs required to maintain and train an in-house recruiting department in a rapidly changing industry;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Ability to use the workflow methodologies we have developed over tens of thousands of assignments, which allows clients to fulfill positions on a streamlined basis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Ability to quickly review millions of resumes and provide the right fit for the client;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Access to the most updated industry and geographic market information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Access to cutting-edge search technology software and proprietary intellectual property; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Ability to maintain management focus on core strategic business issues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other Industry Trends  In addition to the industry trends mentioned above, we believe the following factors will have a long-term positive impact on the talent management industry:


§ | Increasing demand for professionals with not just the right technical skills, but also the right leadership style, values and motivation to meet the specific requirements of the position and organizational culture;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Decreasing executive management tenure and more frequent job changes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Retiring baby boomers, creating a skills gap in the workforce;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Shifting balance of power towards the employee as more people take charge of their own careers, and the new norm of employee-driven development;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Increasing importance of talent mobility in engaging and developing people within an organization;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Increased attention on succession planning due to heightened scrutiny on CEOs, pressure to generate growth, shorter CEO tenures and the emphasis being placed on making succession planning a systemic governance process within global organizations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Executive pay and governance practices under more scrutiny than ever; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | The high turnover rate and varying high volume hiring needs commonly associated with the new shared economy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy 
 Our objective is to expand our position as the preeminent global people and organizational advisory firm. In order to meet this objective, we will continue to pursue five strategic initiatives: 
 1.    Drive an Integrated, Solutions-Based Go-to-Market Strategy 
 Differentiating Client Value Proposition  Korn Ferry offers its clients a total approach to talent. Historically, the HR industry has offered piecemeal views of people based on inconsistent processes, technologies and measurement. Korn Ferry seeks to disrupt the traditional approach and has assembled intellectual property that we bring to market through a holistic framework that sits at the intersection of an organizations strategy and its people. 
In analyzing talent management across the entire value chain, Korn Ferry has developed a robust suite of offerings and leverages our market-leading position in executive search to extend the value we bring our clients through our diversified capabilities along the rest of the talent lifecycle through our Hay Group and Futurestep businesses. 
 Our synergistic go-to-market strategy, utilizing all three of our business segments, is driving more integrated, scalable client relationships, while accelerating our evolution to a consultative solutions-based organization. This is evidenced by the fact that approximately 61% of our revenues come from clients that utilize multiple lines of business. 
 We are an increasingly diversified enterprise in the world of human capital services and products, an industry that represents an estimated $600 billion global market opportunity. Korn Ferry seeks to position itself as the preeminent global provider of solutions that represents a subset of the human capital services and products industry. 
 In an effort to gain operational efficiencies and drive superior performance, we expect that multinational clients increasingly will turn to strategic partners who can manage their people and organizational advisory needs on a centralized basis. This will require vendors with a global network of offices and technological support systems to manage engagements across geographical regions. We established our Marquee Accounts program to act as a catalyst for change as we transform our Company from individual operators to an integrated talent solutions provider, in an effort to drive major global and regional strategic account development as well as to provide a framework for all of our client development activities. Today, the program consists of global colleagues from every 
 
5 
 


 line of business and geography, and is centrally coordinated by global account leaders who have deep expertise in serving the evolving needs of large global clients. We are cascading this methodology throughout every market, country and office. 
 2.    Deliver Unparalleled Client Excellence 
 World-class Intellectual Property  Korn Ferry continues to scale and more deeply embed our industry-leading intellectual property within the talent management processes of our global clients.
Our IP-driven tools and services are being utilized by our clients for everything from organizational development and job profiling to selection, training, individual and team development, succession planning and more. Our subscription services that are delivered on-line are products that help us generate long-term relationships with our clients through large scale and technology-based HR programs on an annuity basis. We continue to seek ways to scale our product offering to our global clients. 
 Global organizations utilizing our Companys validated assessment capability are realizing the power and benefits of Korn Ferry IP in their people processes. Our assessment capability is currently utilized by more than 60% of our Executive Search clients. We have observed that candidates who utilize our online assessment tools stay longer with an organization and are promoted more frequently. 
 Our IP orientation is further expanded by our acquisitions of Legacy Hay, Pivot Leadership, PDI Ninth House and Global Novations. By acquiring these firms, we now offer a variety of pay, leadership development, organization and talent strategy design, coaching and assessment solutions for different organizational levels, as well as technology-driven talent management solutions. We possess several of the richest HR databases in the world, spanning 114 countries  including reward data on twenty million professionals, engagement data on six million professionals and assessment data on five million professionals. 
 Technology  Information technology is a critical element of all of our businesses. In fiscal 2017, we continued to invest in enhanced tools and knowledge management to gain a competitive advantage. We further improved our technology platform to support delivery of Korn Ferrys Four Dimensions of Leadership (KF4D), our newest and most robust assessment for Executive Search, Hay Group and Futurestep. We completed the enhancements to our global SAP and Salesforce enterprise systems and the integration of Legacy Hay into Korn Ferry, providing globally consistent finance, HR, business development and operations processes. We continued to invest in our IT security infrastructure in an effort to protect the Companys assets against todays cyber-security threats.
In fiscal 2017, we further enhanced our scalable intellectual property content repository, which we are leveraging across all products and services. This enables us to continue to integrate services provided across the entire Hay Group portfolio, as well as Executive Search and Futurestep, and we have continued work on a unified talent analytics layer to support Korn Ferrys strategy to address this key industry trend. 
 Information technology is a key driver of Futuresteps growth in RPO, project recruitment and search. Database technology and the Internet have greatly improved capabilities in identifying, targeting and reaching potential candidates. In fiscal 2017, we continued the integration of advanced, Internet-based sourcing, assessment and selection technologies into the engagement workflow including the use of advanced machine learning. We introduced the Recruiter Desktop  a modern, streamlined view of the recruiting workflow across a companys disparate systems incorporating machine learning which dramatically improves the matching capabilities of a candidate to a job requisition. 
 We will continue to enhance our technology in order to strengthen our relationships with clients, expand our markets through new delivery channels and maintain a competitive advantage in offering the full range of executive talent management services. 
 3.    Extend and Elevate the Korn Ferry Brand 
 Next to our people, the Korn Ferry brand is the strongest asset of the Company. Since inception, Korn Ferry has always maintained an aggressive stance in building our global presence and supporting our vision and ongoing growth through a comprehensive marketing approach. At the highest level, we will continue to extend and elevate the Korn Ferry brand to raise awareness and drive higher market share within each of our lines of business. 
 
6 
 


Our leadership in executive search enables us to grow our business by increasing the number of recruitment assignments we handle for existing clients. We also believe that our strong relationships and well-recognized brand name will enable us to bring a broader base of solutions and services to our existing client base and to potential new clients, while allowing us to build communities of candidates to whom we can directly market our services. 
 For example, we will leverage the work our Board & CEO Services practice  recently enhanced by the addition of Legacy Hays Executive Pay and Governance capabilities  performs at the top of our clients organizations to promote awareness of our various solutions. We believe these engagements will create revenue opportunities across all of our lines of business and lead to the expansion of other high-level, consultative relationships within the board and CEO community. 
 We drive additional awareness and brand equity through a global marketing program that leverages Korn Ferry Institute-generated thought leadership (whitepapers, bylined articles, and our award-winning Briefings periodical), aggressive media relations, social media, a sophisticated demand generation platform and other vehicles that include sponsorships, speaking opportunities, advertising and events.
4.    Advance Korn Ferry as a Premier Career Destination 
 As our business strategy evolves, so should our talent strategy in order to drive the growth we need and the culture we want, at a pace we can absorb. Our talent strategy is what allows us to build and attract the best talent for ourselves (and, by extension, for our clients) to achieve our business potential. 
 Our goal is to become the premier career destination for top talent through offering a client-focused culture, promotional/developmental opportunities and compensation that aligns employee behavior to corporate strategy. 
 In fiscal 2018, we will continue our professional development program called Reimagine. Last year all colleagues were invited to take part in a series of pulse surveys, and we have used the results to further inform our internal strategic initiatives. These include the launch of an HR transformation program with a number of work streams addressing areas such as performance management, rewards, career architecture and talent acquisition. We will also expand the Korn Ferry Academy, our firms new center for enterprise-wide internal learning and development. We are committed to investing in the professional and personal development of our people throughout their career with us. 
 5.    Pursue Transformational Opportunities Along the Broad Human Resources Spectrum 
 We have an unrivaled ability to address the entire talent continuum, delivering solutions and products in the following areas: 
 

§ | Strategy Execution and Organization Design
--+-------------------------------------------


§ | Talent Strategy and Work Design
--+--------------------------------


§ | Rewards and Benefits
--+---------------------


§ | Assessment and Succession
--+--------------------------


§ | Executive Search and Recruitment
--+---------------------------------


§ | Leadership Development
--+-----------------------

 We will continue to internally develop and add new products and services that our clients demand while pursuing a disciplined acquisition strategy. We have developed a core competency in the identification, acquisition and integration of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) targets that play a significant role in the attainment of our strategic objectives and the creation of shareholder value. As we look forward, we will continue building Korn Ferry as the leading authority on driving business performance through people. Our disciplined approach to M&A will continue to play a vital role in this journey and is a critical component of our overall approach to capital deployment. 
 Our Services and Organization 
 Organization 
 The Company operates in three global business segments: Executive Search, Hay Group, and Futurestep. Our executive search business is managed on a geographic basis throughout our four regions: North America, Europe, 
 
7 
 


 the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific and Latin America. Hay Group and Futurestep are managed on a global basis with operations in North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America. 
 We address the people and organizational advisory needs of our clients through our three business segments: 
 Executive Search 
 Overview  Korn Ferry Executive Search helps clients attract the best executive talent for executing and delivering their business strategy. Our services are typically used to fill executive-level positions, such as board directors, chief executive officers, chief financial officers, chief operating officers, chief information officers, chief human resource officers and other senior executive officers. 
We utilize a standardized and differentiated approach to placing talent that integrates research based IP with our practical experience. Providing a more complete view of the candidate than is otherwise possible, we believe our proprietary tools generate better results in attracting the right person for the position, and open doors to engage with clients about their broader people and organizational needs. 
 As part of being retained by a client to conduct a search, we assemble a team comprised of consultants with appropriate geographic, industry and functional expertise. Our search consultants serve as management advisors who work closely with the client in identifying, assessing and placing qualified candidates. In fiscal 2017, we executed 5,933 new executive search assignments. 
 We emphasize a close working relationship with the client and a comprehensive understanding of the clients business issues, strategy and culture. The search team consults with its established network of resources and searches our databases containing profiles of approximately five million executives to assist in identifying individuals with the right background, cultural fit and abilities. Through this process, an original list of candidates is carefully screened through phone interviews, video conferences and in-person meetings. Clients and candidates complete Korn Ferrys Four Dimensional Executive Assessment. Launched in fiscal 2015 and powered by Korn Ferrys Four Dimensions of Leadership & Talent, this tool gives clients insights about each candidates competencies, personality traits, drivers, and past experiences that are aligned to the role. We conduct due diligence and background verification of the candidates throughout this process, at times with the assistance of an independent third party. In fiscal 2017, we integrated Hay Groups industry standard job grading, job description and salary benchmark methodologies into the executive search process.
Industry Specialization  Consultants in our five global markets and regional specialty practice groups bring an in-depth understanding of the market conditions and strategic management issues faced by clients within their specific industry and geography. We are continually looking to expand our specialized expertise through internal development and strategic hiring in targeted growth areas.

 Functional Expertise  We have organized executive search centers of functional expertise, composed of consultants who have extensive backgrounds in placing executives in certain functions, such as board directors, CEOs and other senior executive officers. Our Board & CEO Services group, for example, focuses exclusively on placing CEOs and board directors in organizations around the world. This is a dedicated team from the most senior ranks of the Company. Their work is with CEOs and in the board room, and their expertise is organizational leadership and governance. They conduct hundreds of engagements every year, tapping talent from every corner

 of the globe. This work spans all ranges of organizational scale and purpose. Members of functional groups are located throughout our regions and across our industry groups.

Regions 
 North America  We currently have 20 offices throughout the United States and Canada. In fiscal 2017, the region generated fee revenue of $356.6 million and opened 2,361 new engagements with an average of 236 consultants.
EMEA  We currently have 24 offices in 19 countries throughout the region. In fiscal 2017, the region generated fee revenue of $146.5 million and opened 1,755 new engagements with an average of 138 consultants.

Competition  Other multinational executive search firms include Egon Zehnder International, Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc., Russell Reynolds Associates and Spencer Stuart. Although these firms are our largest competitors in executive search, we also compete with smaller boutique firms that specialize in specific regional, industry or functional searches. We believe our brand name, differentiated business model, systematic approach to client service, cutting-edge technology, unique IP, global network, prestigious clientele, strong specialty practices and high-caliber colleagues are recognized worldwide. We also believe our long-term incentive compensation arrangements, as well as other executive benefits, distinguish us from most of our competitors and are important in attracting and retaining our key consultants.
Hay Group 
 Overview  Korn Ferry Hay Group helps an organization align its people to their strategy  organizing, developing, engaging, and rewarding them to reach new heights. We deliver this through a combination of solutions consulting and product services that address how people work, and how to nurture them so that business strategies succeed. We capitalize on the breadth of our intellectual property, service offerings and expertise to do what is right for the client. Services are delivered by an experienced team of consultants and includes one of the richest and most comprehensive people data sets. Solutions consulting fee revenue was $497.7 million, $351.2 million and $203.3 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Solution consulting fee revenue represented 32%, 27% and 20% of fee revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 We have made significant investments in these service areas with the acquisitions of Lominger Limited, Inc., Lominger Consulting (Lominger) and LeaderSource in fiscal 2007, Lore International in fiscal 2009, SENSA Solutions in fiscal 2010, PDI and Global Novations in fiscal 2013, Pivot Leadership in fiscal 2015, and Legacy Hay in fiscal 2016. 
 Regions  Hay Group solutions are delivered by an experienced team of consultants and the richest and most comprehensive people data and insights in the world. As of April 30, 2017, we had Hay Group operations in 22 cities in North America, 37 in EMEA, 20 in Asia Pacific, and 9 in Latin America.

Competition  Our main competitors include firms like Aon Hewitt, Willis Towers Watson, Deloitte, McKinsey, RHR International, Development Dimensions International, Center for Creative Leadership, Right Management, Mercer and SHL, a subsidiary of Corporate Executive Board. Although these firms are our largest competitors, we also compete with smaller boutique firms that specialize in specific regional, industry or functional aspects of leadership and organizational advisory services.
Futurestep 
 Overview  Korn Ferry Futurestep offers clients a portfolio of talent acquisition solutions, including RPO, Project Recruitment, Professional Search, Talent Consulting and Employer Branding. Each Futurestep engagement leverages a global recruitment process, best-in-class technology and proprietary IP to maximize and measure quality.
Futurestep combines traditional recruitment expertise with a multi-tiered portfolio of talent acquisition solutions. Futurestep consultants, based in 26 countries, have access to our databases of pre-screened, mid-level professionals. Our global candidate pool complements our international presence and multi-channel sourcing strategy to provide speed, efficiency and quality service for clients worldwide. 
 Futuresteps customizable end-to-end RPO solution combines our recruiting expertise with state-of-the-art technologies to help companies streamline recruitment processes, enhance candidate experience, and improve cost of, time to, and quality of hire. In fact, Futurestep was recognized as the number one RPO provider in HRO Today Magazines 2016 Bakers Dozen list, marking its tenth consecutive year on the list.
Significant in scope with a defined delivery period, Project Recruitment addresses a specific talent acquisition need at a certain point in time. The impetus for a project engagement is often, though not always, a change or transition within the business. 
 In the area of Professional Search, Futurestep is uniquely positioned to help identify and attract professional and specialized talent, in both single-search and multiple managed search projects. Futuresteps brand association with Korn Ferry has helped us become regarded by todays industry leaders as a trusted resource. 
 Talent Consulting services provide a proven process and deep industry expertise to help clients assess their talent acquisition strategy, identify needs, and prioritize next steps in improving their talent acquisition operations. 
 Employer Branding services apply insight and creativity to help clients attract and engage the best candidates. We use the latest research techniques to identify each clients unique Employer Value Proposition and then bring it to life across the full range of traditional and digital media. 
 Regions  We opened our first Futurestep office in Los Angeles in May 1998. In January 2000, we acquired the Executive Search & Selection business of PA Consulting with operations in Europe and Asia Pacific. As of April 30, 2017, we had Futurestep operations in 14 cities in North America, 13 in EMEA, 18 in Asia Pacific, and 5 in Latin America.
Client Base  During fiscal 2017, Futurestep partnered with 1,525 clients across the globe and 41% of Futuresteps fiscal 2017 fee revenue was referred from Korn Ferrys Executive Search and Hay Group segments.
Competition  Futurestep primarily competes for business with other RPO providers such as Cielo Talent, Alexander Mann Solutions, Hays, Kenexa, Spherion, KellyOCG and ADP, and competes for search assignments with regional contingency recruitment firms and large national retained recruitment firms.
Professional Staff and Employees 
 We have assembled a wealth of talent. Our Company brings together the best and brightest from a wide range of disciplines and professions  everything from academic research and technology development to executive recruiting, consulting, and business leadership. We are also a culturally diverse organization. Our people come from all over the world and speak a multitude of languages. For us, this diversity is a key source of strength. It means we have people who are able to challenge convention, offer unique perspectives, and generate innovative ideas. Equally important, it means we can think and act globally  just like our clients.
