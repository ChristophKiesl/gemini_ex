Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Organovo Holdings, Inc. (“Organovo Holdings,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “our Company”) is an early-stage biotechnology company that focuses on building high fidelity, 3D tissues that recapitulate key aspects of human disease. We use these models to identify gene targets capable of modulating the disease phenotype across multiple patients and intend to initiate drug discovery programs around these validated targets. We are initially targeting the intestine and have ongoing 3D tissue development efforts in Ulcerative colitis (“UC”) and Crohn’s disease (“CD”). We intend to add additional tissues/diseases/targets to our portfolio in the coming year. In line with these plans, we are building upon both our external and in-house scientific expertise, which will be essential to our drug development effort. 
 We use our proprietary technology to build functional 3D human tissues that mimic key aspects of native human tissue composition, architecture, function and disease. Our advances include cell type-specific compartments, prevalent intercellular tight junctions, and the formation of microvascular structures. We believe these attributes can enable critical complex, multicellular disease models that can be used to develop clinically effective drugs across multiple therapeutic areas.
 Our NovoGen Bioprinters® are automated devices that enable the fabrication of 3D living tissues comprised of mammalian cells. We believe that the use of our bioprinting platform as well as complementary 3D technologies will allow us to develop an understanding of disease biology that leads to validated novel drug targets and therapeutics to those targets to treat disease. 
 The majority of our current focus is on inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), including CD and UC.  We expect to create disease models, leveraging our prior work including the work found in our peer-reviewed publication on bioprinted intestinal tissues (Madden et al. Bioprinted 3D Primary Human Intestinal Tissues Model Aspects of Native Physiology and ADME/Tox Functions. iScience. 2018 Apr 27;2:156-167. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2018.03.015.)  Our current understanding of intestinal tissue models and IBD disease models leads us to believe that we can create models that provide greater insight into the biology of these diseases than are generally currently available.  Using these disease models, we intend to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets.  After finding therapeutic drug targets, we will focus on developing novel small molecule, antibody, or other therapeutic drug candidates to treat the disease, and advance these drug candidates towards an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) filing and potential future clinical trials.  
 We expect to broaden our work into additional therapeutic areas over time and are currently exploring specific tissues for development.  In our work to identify the areas of interest, we evaluate areas that might be better served with 3D disease models than currently available models as well as the commercial opportunity.
 
Historical Operations and Strategic Alternatives Process
 From early 2018 to August 2019, we focused our efforts on developing our in vivo liver tissues to treat end-stage liver disease and a select group of life-threatening, orphan diseases, for which there are limited treatment options other than organ transplantation. We also explored the development of other potential pipeline in vivo tissue constructs in-house and through collaborations with academic and government researchers. In the past, we also explored the development of in vitro tissues, including proof of concept models of diseased tissues, for use in drug discovery and development.
 In August 2019, after a rigorous assessment of our in vivo liver therapeutic tissue program, we concluded that the variability of biological performance and related duration of potential benefits no longer supported an attractive opportunity due to redevelopment challenges and lengthening timelines to compile sufficient data to support an IND filing. As a result, we suspended development of our lead program and all other related in-house pipeline development activities.
 Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) also engaged a financial advisory firm to explore our available strategic alternatives, including evaluating a range of ways to generate value from our technology platform and intellectual property, our commercial and development capabilities, our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and our remaining financial assets. These strategic alternatives included possible mergers and business combinations, sales of part or all of our assets, and licensing and partnering arrangements. We implemented various restructuring steps to manage our resources and extend our cash runway, including reducing commercial activities related to our liver tissues, except for sales of primary human cells out of inventory, negotiating an exit from our long-term facility lease, selling various assets, and reducing our workforce. Additionally, in November 2019, we sold certain inventory and equipment and related proprietary information held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Samsara Sciences, Inc. (“Samsara”), and as a result of such sale, Samsara ceased its operations and has since been dissolved.
 After conducting a diligent and extensive process of evaluating strategic alternatives and identifying and reviewing potential candidates for a strategic acquisition or other transaction, which included the receipt of more than 27 non-binding indications of interest from interested parties and careful evaluation and consideration of those proposals, and following extensive negotiations with Tarveda Therapeutics, Inc. (“Tarveda”), on December 13, 2019, we entered into a merger agreement with Tarveda (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger 
 2

Agreement, our wholly-owned merger subsidiary would merge with and into Tarveda (the “Merger”), with Tarveda becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Organovo and the surviving corporation of the Merger . The Merger Agreement included various conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including approval by our stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders that was held on April 7, 2020 (the “Special Meeting”).
 At the Special Meeting, the Merger was not approved by our stockholders. As a result, we terminated the Merger Agreement with Tarveda. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we were obligated to reimburse certain of Tarveda’s merger-related expenses not to exceed $300,000, which was offset by Tarveda’s portion of shared expenses incurred by us in fiscal 2020. 
 The Cooperation Agreement and Advisory Nominees Proposal
 Following the Special Meeting and the termination of the Merger Agreement, our Board continued to solicit stockholder feedback regarding our strategic alternatives and how to maximize stockholder value. In response to feedback from our largest stockholder regarding its desire for our Board to consider opportunities in the 3D bioprinting field and suggestion that our Board should speak with Keith Murphy, our founder, stockholder and former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, for potential business ideas, our Board initiated discussions with Mr. Murphy. Based on these discussions, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Mr. Murphy on July 14, 2020 (the “Cooperation Agreement”). Under the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, our Board appointed Mr. Murphy and Adam K. Stern to the Board as Class III directors, and two of our existing directors, Richard Maroun and David Shapiro, resigned from our Board and the committees thereof. Our Board also agreed to nominate, recommend, support and solicit proxies for the re-election of Messrs. Murphy and Stern at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “2020 Annual Meeting”). Our Board also agreed to nominate, recommend, support and solicit proxies for an advisory stockholder vote (the “Advisory Nominees Proposal”) at the 2020 Annual Meeting to appoint three individuals, Douglas Jay Cohen, David Gobel and Alison Tjosvold Milhous (collectively, the “Advisory Nominees”), to our Board. Mr. Murphy identified each of the Advisory Nominees. Our Board approved the appointment of the Advisory Nominees, to be automatically effective immediately following the final adjournment of the 2020 Annual Meeting if the final vote tabulation for the Advisory Nominees Proposal received more votes cast “FOR” than “AGAINST” its approval. In addition, each of our then-current directors (other than Messrs. Murphy and Stern) agreed to resign from our Board immediately following the appointment of the Advisory Nominees. At the 2020 Annual Meeting held on September 15, 2020, our stockholders approved the re-election of Messrs. Murphy and Stern to our Board as Class III directors to hold office until the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the final vote tabulation for the Advisory Nominees Proposal received more votes cast “FOR” than “AGAINST” its approval and, accordingly, effective upon the final adjournment of the 2020 Annual Meeting, Ms. Milhous was appointed as a Class I director to hold office until the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Messrs. Cohen and Gobel were appointed as Class II directors to hold office until the 2022 Annual Meeting (collectively, the “New Director Slate”) and Carolyn Beaver, Taylor Crouch, Mark Kessel and Kirk Malloy, Ph.D. each resigned as directors. Following the election of the New Director Slate, we have recommenced operations and are now focusing our future efforts on developing highly customized 3D human tissues as living, dynamic models of healthy and diseased human biology for drug development.
Our Platform Technology 
 Our 3D human tissue platform is multifaceted. We approach each tissue agnostic to specific technologies, and intend to apply the best 3D technology to a given disease. We are developing novel disease models using high throughput systems, bioprinted and flow/stretch capable 3D systems as appropriate. Our proprietary NovoGen Bioprinters® and related technologies for preparing bio-inks and bioprinting multicellular tissues with complex architecture are grounded in over a decade of peer-reviewed scientific publications, deriving originally from research led by Dr. Gabor Forgacs, one of our founders and a former George H. Vineyard Professor of Biological Physics at the University of Missouri-Columbia (“MU”). We have a broad portfolio of intellectual property rights covering the principles, enabling instrumentation, applications, and methods of cell-based printing, including exclusive licenses to certain patented and patent pending technologies from MU and Clemson University. We own or exclusively license more than 90 patents and pending applications worldwide covering specific tissue designs, uses, and methods of manufacture.
The NovoGen Bioprinter® Platform 
 Our NovoGen Bioprinters® are automated devices that enable the fabrication of 3D living tissues comprised of mammalian cells. A custom graphic user interface (“GUI”) facilitates the 3D design and execution of scripts that direct precision movement of multiple dispensing heads to deposit defined cellular building blocks called bio-ink. Bio-ink can be formulated as a 100% cellular composition or as a mixture of cells and other matter (hydrogels, particles). Our NovoGen Bioprinters® can also dispense pure hydrogel formulations, provided the physical properties of the hydrogel are compatible with the dispensing parameters. Most typically, hydrogels are deployed to create void spaces within specific locations in a 3D tissue or to aid in the deposition of specific cell types. We are able to employ a wide variety of proprietary cell- and hydrogel-based bio-inks in the fabrication of tissues. Our NovoGen Bioprinters® also serve as important components of our tissue prototyping and manufacturing platform, as they are able to rapidly and precisely fabricate intricate small-scale tissue models for in vitro use as well as larger-scale tissues suitable for in vivo use.

Generation of bio-ink comprising human cells is the first step in our standard bioprinting. A wide variety of cells and cell-laden hydrogels can be formulated into bio-ink and bioprinted tissues, including cell lines, primary cells, and stem/progenitor cells. The majority of tissue designs employ two or more distinct varieties of bio-ink, usually comprised of cells that represent distinct compartments within a target tissue. For example, a 3D liver tissue might consist of two to three distinct bio-inks that are each made from a single cell type, a combination of cell types, and/or a combination of primary cells and one or more bio-inert hydrogels that serve as physical supports for the bioprinted tissue during its maturation period, or to transiently occupy negative spaces in a tissue design. 
 Research Collaborations 
 We continue to collaborate with several academic institutions by providing them with access to our NovoGen Bioprinters® for research purposes, including: Yale School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University, and the University of Virginia. We believe that the use of our bioprinting platform by major research institutions may help to advance the capabilities of the platform and generate new applications for bioprinted tissues. In prior instances, an academic institution or other third party provided funding to support the academic collaborator’s access to our technology platform. This funding was typically reflected as collaboration revenues in our financial statements. Our academic research collaborations typically involve both parties contributing resources directly to projects. We are not currently generating any revenues from these collaborations.
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidential know-how, copyrights and a variety of contractual mechanisms such as confidentiality, material transfer, licenses, research collaboration, limited technology access, and invention assignment agreements, to protect our intellectual property. Our intellectual property portfolio for our core technology was initially built through licenses from MU and the Medical University of South Carolina. We subsequently expanded our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent and trademark applications worldwide and negotiating additional licenses and purchases.
 We recently completed a review and analysis of our full intellectual property portfolio to align it with our current business needs, strategies and objectives.  Based on that review, a number of patents and patent applications in various countries were abandoned or allowed to lapse.  The numbers provided herein are reflective of those changes.
 
We solely own or hold exclusive licenses to 30 issued U.S. patents and more than 40 issued international patents in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Germany, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, the Netherlands and Switzerland. We solely or jointly own or hold exclusive licenses to 8 pending U.S. patent applications and more than 14 pending international applications in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, Japan and South Korea. These patent families relate to our bioprinting technology and our engineered tissue products and services, including our various uses in areas of tissue creation, in vitro testing, utilization in drug discovery, and in vivo therapeutics.
 In-Licensed Intellectual Property
 In 2009 and 2010, we obtained world-wide exclusive licenses to intellectual property owned by MU and the Medical University of South Carolina, which now includes 6 issued U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. applications and 11 issued international patents. Dr. Gabor Forgacs, one of our founders and a former George H. Vineyard Professor of Biophysics at MU, was one of the co-inventors of all of these works (collectively, the “Forgacs Intellectual Property”). The Forgacs Intellectual Property provides us with intellectual property rights relating to cellular aggregates, the use of cellular aggregates to create engineered tissues, and the use of cellular aggregates to create engineered tissue with no scaffold present. The intellectual property rights derived from the Forgacs Intellectual Property also enables us to utilize our NovoGen Bioprinter® to create engineered tissues. 
 In 2011, we obtained an exclusive license to a U.S. patent (U.S. Pat. No. 7,051,654) owned by the Clemson University Research Foundation that provides us with intellectual property rights relating to methods of using ink-jet printer technology to dispense cells and relating to the creation of matrices of bioprinted cells on gel materials. 
 In 2015, we obtained world-wide exclusive licenses to intellectual property owned by The University of Queensland (collectively, “UniQuest Intellectual Property”) relating to technologies for producing kidney cells and kidney organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (“iPSCs”). This intellectual property has been returned to UniQuest Pty Limited.

The patent rights we obtained through these exclusive licenses are not only foundational within the field of 3D bioprinting but provide us with favorable priority dates. We are required to make ongoing royalty payments under these exclusive licenses based on net sales of products and services that rely on the intellectual property we in-licensed. For additional information regarding our royalty obligations see “Note 4. Collaborative Research, Development, and License Agreements” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
 Company Owned Intellectual Property
 In addition to the intellectual property we have in-licensed, we have historically innovated and grown our intellectual property portfolio.

These issued patents and pending patent applications carry remaining patent terms ranging from over 14 years to just over 11 years. We have additional U.S. patent applications pending in these families, as well as foreign counterpart applications in multiple countries. We currently have pending numerous patent applications in the U.S. and globally that are directed to additional tissue types, their methods of fabrication, and specific applications.
 Our U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,855,369 and 9,149,952, which relate to our bioprinter technology, are the subject of IPR proceedings filed by Cellink AB, one of our competitors. In addition, U.S. Patent Nos. 9,149,952, 9,855,369, 8,931,880, 9,227,339 and 9,315,043 (all assigned to Organovo, Inc.) and U.S. Patent Nos. 7,051,654 and 9,752,116 (assigned to Clemson University and the University of Missouri, respectively) are implicated in a declaratory judgment complaint filed against Organovo, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, by Cellink AB and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. For more information regarding these proceedings, see the section titled “Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.”
 COVID-19
 In December 2019, a respiratory illness caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019, also known as COVID-19 emerged. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China, it has since spread globally and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty. The pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, and business shutdowns. In 2020, we adapted quickly to COVID-19, instituting universal masking and distancing in the lab and in the offices. We encouraged and enabled remote work whenever possible. We instituted safety check software to monitor symptoms and have successfully maintained a robust level of progress while ensuring the safety of our employees. As the viral load and variants allow, we intend to carefully return to more typical lab and office work flow. 
 The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the rise of vaccine-resistant variants, duration of the outbreak, travel bans, restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, and business shutdowns. In particular, the continued COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact various aspects of our operations, including among others, our ability to raise additional capital, the timing and ability to pursue our strategy, given the impact the pandemic may have on the manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations of potential strategic partners, and the ability to advance our research and development activities and pursue development of our pipeline products, each of which could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results. Our employees and consultants have recently returned to working at our office and lab when necessary and we currently believe our operations have not otherwise been negatively impacted by the pandemic.
