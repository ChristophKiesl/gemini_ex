ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
----------------------------------+----------

Overview
 
Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (including our subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “Company” or “Digerati”), through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Shift8 Networks, Inc. (“Shift8”), provides a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network, which is interconnected to numerous U.S. and foreign service providers. Our services are designed to provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to small-to-medium sized businesses ("SMB") at affordable monthly rates. Our services, known as Unified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) or cloud communications, include fully hosted IP/PBX, mobile applications, Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) transport, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud™.
History
 
Digerati was formed in 2004 as the successor to a business originally commenced by Latcomm International, Inc., a Canadian company formed in 1994. We began providing communication services in 1995 along the U.S.-Mexico corridor to capitalize on the opportunities created by the deregulation of the telecommunication industries within Latin America. Through FY 2012 our principal business was providing transportation of voice traffic for other telecommunication service providers, wireless carriers and regional Internet telephony providers using VoIP technologies.
 
Until July 2014, Digerati owned a waste disposal business focused on disposing of solid and liquid wastes from drilling sites and an oilfield services business providing skid houses, telecommunication services, booster booths, portable restrooms, generators, potable water, and mess halls to drilling contractors and oil companies in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota. 
 
During FY 2016 Flagship Energy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digerati, entered into an Agreement with a Texas-based contract-for-hire oil and gas operator (“Operator”). Under the Agreement, Flagship utilized the Operator for the drilling, completion and the initial operations of a shallow oil and gas well in conjunction with the purchase of 100% of Operator’s working interest and 80% of its Net Revenue Interest. Under the Agreement, the Operator agreed to transfer all field-level operations and assign 100% of a certain oil, gas and mineral lease to Flagship upon demand, which included a tract of land located in South Texas. Additionally, Flagship entered into a Joint Operating Agreement ("JOA") with Operator, whereby the parties agreed to develop the oil and gas well or wells for the production and retrieval of oil and gas commodities as provided for in the oil, gas and mineral lease. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 the Company recognized an impairment loss of $248,000 for the total capitalized investment amount in the oil and gas properties.
 
Recent Developments
 
In May 2017, Shift8 and T3 Acquisition, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Acquisition Sub”), and newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Shift8 Technologies, Inc.(“Shift8 Tech”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with T3 Communications, Inc., a Florida corporation (“T3”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into T3, with T3 continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shift8 Tech. The Company anticipates closing the transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Merger has been approved by the Shareholders of T3 and is subject to certain customary closing conditions.
 
Between April and October 2017, we have raised $840,000 through the issuance of 1,680,000 shares of Digerati common stock and three-year warrants to purchase up to 315,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share.

On December 1, 2017, Shift8 Technologies, In., a Nevada corporation (“Shift8”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), and Synergy Telecom, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Synergy"), closed a transaction to acquire all the assets, assumed all customers, and critical vendor arrangements from Synergy. The agreed purchase price was $450,000. Shift8 paid $125,000 upon execution of the Agreement and issued 500,000 shares of common stock with an agreed market value of $200,000. In addition, Shift8 entered into a promissory note with the seller for $125,000 with an effective annual interest rate of 6%, 5 quarterly payments and a maturity date of February 28, 2019.
 
Products and Services
 
We provide a comprehensive suite of Internet-based communication services to meet the global needs of businesses that are seeking simple, flexible, and cost-effective communication solutions. Our Internet-based services include fully hosted IP/PBX services, mobile applications, SIP trunking, call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment. Our services, known as UCaaS or cloud communications, are specifically designed for the needs of the small to medium-sized business, enterprise customers, call centers with international communication requirements, and regional Internet service providers that do not have the scale necessary to acquire their own telephony infrastructure.
 
In addition, we operate a VoIP network for processing voice communication services to U.S. and foreign telecommunications companies that lack transmission facilities or require additional capacity to terminate VoIP traffic in Mexico, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
 
Voice over Internet Protocol Networks 
 
The basic technology of traditional telecommunications systems was designed for slow mechanical switches. Communications over the traditional telephone network are routed through circuits that must dedicate all circuit resources to each call from its inception until the call ends, regardless of whether anyone is actually talking on the circuit. This circuit-switching technology incurs a significant cost per call and does not efficiently support the integration of voice with data services. Data networks, however, were designed for electronic switching. They break the data stream into small, individually addressed packages of data (“packets”) that are routed independently of each other from the origin to the destination. Therefore, they do not require a fixed amount of bandwidth to be reserved between the origin and destination of each call and they do not waste bandwidth when it is not being used for actual transmission of information. This allows multiple voice or voice and data calls to be pooled, resulting in these networks being able to carry more calls with an equal amount of bandwidth. Moreover, they do not require the same complex switching methods required by traditional voice telephone networks, instead using a multiplicity of routers to direct each packet to its destination and automatically routing packets around blockages, congestion or outages.
 
Packet switching can be used within a data network or across networks, including the public Internet. The Internet itself is not a single data network owned by any single entity, but rather a loose interconnection of networks belonging to many owners that communicate using the Internet Protocol (“IP”). By converting voice signals to digital data and handling the voice signals as data, it can be transmitted through the more efficient switching networks designed for data transmissions and through the Internet using the IP. The transmission of voice signals as digitalized data streams over the Internet is known as Voice over Internet Protocol or “VoIP”. A VoIP network has the following advantages over traditional networks:
 

● | Simplification: An integrated infrastructure that supports all forms of communication allows more standardization, a smaller equipment complement, and less equipment management.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Network Efficiency: The integration of voice and data fills up the data communication channels efficiently, thus providing bandwidth consolidation and reduction of the costs associated with idle bandwidth. This combined infrastructure can support dynamic bandwidth optimization and a fault tolerant design. The differences between the traffic patterns of voice and data offer further opportunities for significant efficiency improvements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Co-existence with traditional communication mediums: IP telephony can be used in conjunction with existing public telephone system switches, leased and dial-up lines, PBXs and other customer premise equipment, enterprise LANs, and Internet connections. IP telephony applications can be implemented through dedicated gateways, which in turn can be based on open standards platforms for reliability and scalability.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Cost reduction: Under the VoIP network, the connection is directly to the Internet backbone and as a result the telephony access charges and settlement fees are avoided.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The growth of voice over the Internet was limited in the past due to poor sound quality caused by technical issues such as delays in packet transmission and by bandwidth limitations related to Internet network capacity and local access constraints. However, the continuing addition of data network infrastructure, improvements in packet switching and compression technology, new software algorithms and improved hardware have substantially reduced delays in packet transmissions and resulted in better sound quality. Nevertheless, certain VoIP routes into countries with limited or poor Internet infrastructure continue to lack the consistent quality required for voice transport and termination.
 
We believe that the infrastructure required for a global network is too expensive for most companies to acquire and deploy on their own. As a result, many companies use a network consisting of a combination of gateways owned by different operators. For a network to achieve optimal functionality and quality, however, the gateways need to be interoperable, or able to communicate with one another. Technological solutions have emerged that support interoperability between different protocols and/or gateways. Cisco Systems, Inc. has emerged as a dominant supplier of VoIP gateways and other manufacturers often seek to make their equipment interoperable with Cisco.
 
Long distance telephone calls transported over the Internet are less expensive than similar calls carried over the traditional telephone network primarily because the cost of using the Internet is not determined by the distance those calls need to travel. Also, routing calls over the Internet is more cost-effective than routing calls over the traditional telephone network because the technology that enables Internet telephony is more efficient than traditional telephone network technology. The greater efficiency of the Internet creates cost savings that can be passed on to the consumer in the form of lower long-distance rates or retained by the carrier as higher margins.
 
By using the public Internet, VoIP providers like us are able to avoid direct payment for transport of communications, instead of paying for large “pipes” into the public Internet, billed by bandwidth rather than usage, which transmits calls to a distant gateway. The Internet, which has its origins in programs devised by the Department of Defense to provide multiple routes and therefore redundancy which was largely immune from the failure of a single network element, provides great redundancy and can be “self healing” in the event of an outage in a particular network element or transmission path. Moreover, adding an additional entry or exit point (a Point of Presence or “PoP”) does not require any expensive or time-consuming reconfiguration or reprogramming of existing network elements. The new element is simply installed with a specific IP address and it can send or receive information to or from any other IP address on the Internet.
 
Cloud Communications
 
Cloud communications are Internet-based voice and data communications where telecommunications applications, switching and storage are hosted by a third-party service provider outside of the organization using the services. Services are accessed by the user over the public Internet. Cloud telephony refers specifically to voice services and more specifically the replacement of conventional business telephone equipment (such as a PBX) with VoIP service hosted by a third-party service provider and delivered over the Internet.
 
We operate a cloud communication network that consists of a VoIP switching system and cloud telephony application platform. Our network allows us to provide end-to-end cloud telephony solutions designed to provide significant benefits to businesses of all sizes, with single or multiple locations. The integration of our cloud communication platform and global VoIP network allows us to provide our customers with virtually any type of telephony solution on a global basis.
 
Our cloud communication solutions, also known as UCaaS, are designed to minimize upfront capital costs, increase the scalability and flexibility of the customer’s communications network and service environment, provide robust features and functionality to increase productivity and reduce the overall cost of communications.

Strategy
 
Our strategy is to target the small to medium-sized business market through distributors and Value-Added Resellers (“VARs”) that we enable with our communication network. Our typical VAR is an information technology services firm, traditional PBX vendor, managed service provider, or systems integrator that has established relationships with businesses in its local market. These VARs are currently providing local customer support for other IT or PBX services, but lack the technology infrastructure to provide cloud communication and VoIP services to their customers. Our strategy allows these VARs to focus on their strength of providing first tier support to their customers while we provide the second and third tier technical support required to operate a cloud communication and VoIP network. In addition, we transform our VARs’ business model by introducing new cloud telephony services and adding a new and lucrative recurring revenue stream that increases the VARs’ value proposition for its current and prospective customers.
 
Our cloud-based technology platform enables our VARs to deliver enhanced voice services to their business customers. The features supported on our cloud communication platform include all standard telephone features and value-added applications such as voicemail to email, VoIP peering, teleconferencing, IVR auto attendant, and dial-by-name directory. Our system allows the VAR and its customers a migration path from a traditional PBX system to a complete cloud-based PBX solution.
 
Our strategic initiatives to successfully meet our long-term business objectives include:
 

● | Repositioning around our cloud and session-based communication services, segments of the industry that are experiencing significant growth and where there are new business opportunities for us. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Emphasis on our sales distribution model that enables our VARs to offer cloud and session-based communication services to the enterprise market in various regions and industries. 
● | Leverage our existing global network and relationships to provide new and innovative VoIP solutions in high demand by enterprise customers. 
● | Continue enhancing our infrastructure and back office system to streamline operations, automate key processes, and support the scalability of our VAR distribution model. 

Competitive Conditions
 
The cloud services industry, including the provisioning of cloud communications services, cloud connectivity, cloud storage and cloud computing, as well as carrier voice and data services, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change and intense marketing by providers with similar products and services. We expect that new, smaller, but very agile carrier competitors, specializing in providing service to regional and emerging markets at low margin and hence low cost, may have an impact on the carrier market. Similarly, the business services market includes competitors who may be significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence, financial, technical, operational and marketing resources than we do, including Tier 1 carriers, cable companies and premise-based solutions providers. In the event that such a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets where we compete with them, we may not be able to compete successfully in those markets. Specialized cloud services providers, who focus on one or more cloud service or application, could adopt aggressive pricing and promotion practices that could impact our ability to compete. We also believe that competition will continue to increase, placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce our costs commensurate with the price reductions of our competitors. In addition, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies to provide the same or similar services offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost-effective services than ours, we may not be able to increase our revenues or capture any significant market share.
 
The long-distance telephony market and the Internet telephony market are highly competitive. Our competitors include major telecommunications carriers in the U.S., foreign telecommunications carriers (which may be owned by foreign governments), and numerous small competitors. We expect to face continuing competition based on price and service offerings from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future. The principal competitive factors in our market include price, coverage, customer service, technical response times, reliability, and network size/capacity. The competitive landscape is rapidly altering the number, identity and competitiveness of the marketplace, and we are unable to determine with certainty the impact of potential consolidation in our industry.

A number of large long-distance carriers have introduced services that make Internet telephony or voice services over the Internet available to other carriers. All major telecommunications companies either presently do or could route traffic to destinations worldwide and compete directly with us. Emerging Internet telephony service providers also offer low-cost Internet telephony services from personal computers to telephones and from telephones to telephones. In addition, Internet service providers and other companies currently in related markets are now providing voice over the Internet services or have adapted their products to enable voice over the Internet services. These related companies may migrate into the Internet telephony market as direct competitors.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have. As a result, certain of these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies that could hinder our ability to market our services. We believe that our key competitive advantages are our ability to deliver reliable, high quality voice service over the Internet in a cost-effective manner and our VAR distribution model. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these advantages will enable us to succeed against comparable service offerings from our competitors.
 
Government Regulation
 
VoIP and other communications services, like ours, have been subject to less regulation at the state and federal levels than traditional telecommunications services. Providers of traditional telecommunications services are subject to the highest degree of regulation, while providers of VoIP and other information services are largely exempt from most federal and state regulations governing traditional common carriers. The FCC has subjected VoIP service providers to a smaller subset of regulations that apply to traditional telecommunications service providers and has not yet classified VoIP services as either telecommunications or information. The FCC is currently examining the status of VoIP service providers and the services they provide in multiple open proceedings. In addition, many state regulatory agencies impose taxes and other surcharges on VoIP services, and certain states take the position that offerings by VoIP providers are intrastate telecommunications services and therefore subject to state regulation. These states argue that if the beginning and end points of communications are known, and if some of these communications occur entirely within the boundaries of a state, the state can regulate that offering. We believe that the FCC has preempted states from regulating VoIP offerings in the same manner as providers of traditional telecommunications services. However, this issue has not been resolved definitively as a matter of law, and it remains possible that the FCC could determine that such services are not information services, or that there could be a judicial or legislative determination that the states are not preempted from regulating VoIP services as traditional telecommunications services. We cannot predict how or when these issues will be resolved or its potential future impact on our business at this time.
 
The effect of any future laws, regulations and orders on our operations, including, but not limited to, our cloud-based communications and collaboration services, cannot be determined. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases service costs that may or may not be recoverable from our customers, which could result in making our services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services if we increase our prices or decreasing our profit margins if we attempt to absorb such costs.
 
Federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Regulation of Internet-based Telecommunication Services in the United States
 
We have the necessary authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act to operate as a domestic and international carrier. We are considered a non-dominant domestic interstate carrier subject to minimal regulation by the FCC. We are not required to obtain FCC authority to initiate or expand our domestic interstate operations, but we are required to obtain FCC approval to transfer control or discontinue service and are required to file various reports and pay various fees and assessments. In addition, we must offer service on a nondiscriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates and are subject to the FCC’s complaint jurisdiction. Generally, our international carrier traffic is subject to minimal regulation by state and local jurisdictions.

The FCC requires Internet voice communications service providers, such as our company, to provide E-911 service in all geographic areas covered by the traditional wire-line E-911 network. Under the FCC’s rules, Internet voice communications providers must transmit the caller’s phone number and registered location information to the appropriate public safety answering point, or PSAP, for the caller’s registered location. The FCC also requires interconnected VoIP service providers to make Universal Service Fund (“USF”) contributions. We believe that our services are currently compliant with all applicable requirements of the FCC, and we have made and are making the required contributions to the USF. However, should we at some time fail to meet certain requirements or fail to make required contributions, we could be subject to revocation of our authority to operate or to fines or penalties.
 
Some states have tried to directly regulate VoIP services on an intrastate basis, but these efforts have not held up to court challenges to date. Many states are holding hearings to research and discuss the issues surrounding the regulation of VoIP services. Others are encouraging or even requesting VoIP service providers to subject themselves to public service commission jurisdiction and obtain certification as telephone companies. However, most have adopted a “wait and see” attitude. We monitor the actions of the various state regulatory agencies to ensure that we are in compliance with the applicable regulations, including any new regulations that may be passed. However, there can be no assurance that we will become aware of all applicable requirements on a timely basis, or that we will always be fully compliant with applicable rules and regulations. Should we fail at any time to be compliant with applicable state regulations, or to file required reports to state regulatory agencies, we could be subject to fines or other penalties.
 
Other regulations affecting the Internet in the United States.
 
Congress has enacted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet, including online content, user privacy and taxation. In addition, Congress and other federal entities are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would further regulate the Internet. Congress has, for example, considered legislation on a wide range of issues including Internet spamming, database privacy, gambling, pornography and child protection, Internet fraud, privacy and digital signatures. Various states have adopted and are considering Internet-related legislation. Increased U.S. regulation of the Internet may slow its growth, particularly if other governments follow suit, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business over the Internet and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
 
International Regulation
 
The regulatory treatment of Internet telephony outside of the U.S. varies widely from country to country. A number of countries that currently prohibit competition in the provision of voice telephony also prohibit Internet telephony. Other countries permit but regulate Internet telephony. Some countries will evaluate proposed Internet telephony service on a case-by-case basis and determine whether it should be regulated as a voice service or as another telecommunications service. In many countries, Internet telephony has not yet been addressed by legislation or regulation. Increased regulation of the Internet and/or Internet telephony providers or the prohibition of Internet telephony in one or more countries could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects.
 
The International Settlements Policy governs settlements between U.S. carriers’ and foreign carriers’ costs of terminating traffic over each other’s networks. The FCC enacted certain changes in rules designed to allow U.S. carriers to propose methods to pay for international call termination that deviate from traditional accounting rates and the International Settlement Policy. The FCC has also established lower benchmarks for the rates that U.S. carriers can pay foreign carriers for the termination of international services and these benchmarks may continue to decline. These rule changes have lowered the costs of our competitors to terminate traffic in the United States and are contributing to the downward pricing pressure facing us in the market.

Customers and Suppliers
 
We rely on various suppliers to provide services in connection with our communication services. We use various global VoIP companies to complete our voice over Internet traffic between US, Mexico, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Our customers include traditional carriers, telephony resellers and other VoIP carriers. We are not dependent upon any single supplier or customer.
 
During the year ended July 31, 2017, the Company derived a significant amount of revenue from four customers, comprising 24%, 24%, 11%, and 8% of the total revenue for the period, respectively, compared to four customers, comprising 26%, 19%, 16%, and 13% of the total revenue for the year ended July 31, 2016.
 
As of the year ended July 31, 2017, the Company derived a significant amount of accounts receivable from three customers, comprising 37%, 27% and 14% of the total accounts receivable for the period, compared to three customers, comprising 68%, 25% and 7% of the total accounts receivable for the year ended July 31, 2016.
 
Employees
 
As of July 31, 2017, we had 7 employees, all of whom performed operational, technical and administrative functions. We believe our future success will depend to a large extent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of these aforementioned employees belongs to labor unions.

DIGERATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
 AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Description of Business. Digerati Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Company” or “Digerati”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 24, 2004. Digerati is a diversified holding company that has no independent operations apart from its subsidiaries. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Shift8 Technologies, Inc., we are an established cloud telephony service provider that offers a comprehensive suite of cloud communication services to meet the global needs of businesses that are seeking simple, flexible, and cost-effective communication solutions. Unlike legacy phone systems, our telephony services are delivered Only in the Cloud...™, or over the Internet, making service available to customers from anywhere internet access is available. 
 
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Digerati, and its subsidiaries, which are majority owned by Digerati In accordance with ASC 810-10-05. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
 
Reclassifications. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year for comparative purposes.
 
Use of Estimates. In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenue and expenses in the statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject Digerati to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, Digerati provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, Digerati performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses, which, when realized, have been within the range of management’s expectations. Digerati maintains cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Digerati has not experienced any losses in such accounts and Digerati does not believe it’s exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
 
Revenue Recognition. Digerati derives revenue from two product offerings Global VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been provided, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining.
 
Digerati records and reports its revenue on the gross amount billed to its customers in accordance with the following indicators:
 

● | Digerati is the primary obligor in its arrangements,
--+-----------------------------------------------------
● | Digerati has latitude in establishing pricing, 


● | Digerati changes the product or performs part of the service and is involved in the determination of the product or service specifications,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Digerati has discretion in supplier selection and
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Digerati assumes credit risk for the amount billed to the customer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Sources of revenue: 
 
Global VoIP Services: We currently provide VoIP communication services to U.S. and foreign telecommunications companies that lack transmission facilities, require additional capacity or do not have the regulatory licenses to terminate traffic in Mexico, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Typically, these telecommunications companies offer their services to the public for domestic and international long-distance services
 
Cloud Communication Services: We provide cloud communication services to value-added resellers and enterprise customers. The service includes fully hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, prepaid services, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment.
 
Cost of Services: 
 
Global VoIP Services: We incur transmission and termination charges from our suppliers and the providers of the infrastructure and network. The cost is based on rate per minute, volume of minutes transported and terminated through the network. Additionally, we incur fixed Internet bandwidth charges and per minute billing charges. In some cases we incur installation charges from certain carriers. These installation costs are passed on to our customers for the connection to our VoIP network.

21
--

 

Cloud Communication Services: We incur bandwidth, licensing, and co-location charges in connection with cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connection between our customers to allow them access to our services.
 
Cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
 
Oil and gas properties. 
 
The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties and, accordingly, exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells have discovered proved commercial reserves. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs and delay rentals on unproved leaseholds are charged to exploration expense as incurred. The costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of oil and gas are capitalized. Costs to operate and maintain field equipment are expensed as incurred. Direct costs of acquiring developed or undeveloped leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokerage and other fees, are capitalized. A gain or loss is recognized when a property is sold or an entire field ceases to produce and is abandoned.
 
The Company annually reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such properties may not be recoverable. When it is determined that an oil and gas property’s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 the Company recognized an impairment loss of $248,000 on the Company’s oil and gas properties.
 
Unproved properties are assessed periodically on a property-by-property basis and any impairment in value recognized. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Unproved properties are not subject to depletion, depreciation and amortization. The Company had no proved or unproved properties as of July 31, 2017.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
 
Bad debt expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of likely losses each year based on past experience and an estimate of current year uncollectible amounts. As of July 31, 2017 and 2016, Digerati’s allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $0 and $0, respectively.
 
Property and equipment. Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are one to five years.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Digerati reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Digerati assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value.
 
Derivative financial instruments. Digerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting.
 
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments, Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments.
 
The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.

Income taxes. Digerati recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Digerati provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.
 
Since January 1, 2007, Digerati accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize, measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to this guidance, Digerati recognizes a tax benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. As of July 31, 2017 we have no liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
 
Stock-based compensation. Digerati accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions on share-based payments which require measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
 
Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an “as if converted” basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the year ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, potential dilutive securities including options and warrants had dilutive effect and were included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per common share.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:
 
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
 
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
 
For certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.
 
Recently issued accounting pronouncements. Digerati does not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on Digerati’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
 
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
 
Financial Condition
 
Digerati’s consolidated financial statements for the year ending July 31, 2017 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $77,637,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $527,000 which raises substantial doubt about Digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern.

23

Management Plans to Continue as a Going Concern
 
Management believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations over the next 12 months. The Company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such additional funding from various possible sources, including the public equity market, private financings, sales of assets, collaborative arrangements and debt. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds, or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to delay or reduce the scope of its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.
 
The Company will continue to work with various funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.
 
Digerati’s consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2017 do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute Digerati’s plans to improve our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
NOTE 3 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
 
During fiscal 2008, Digerati made a loan of $150,000 to NetSapiens Inc. The note receivable had a maturity date of June 26, 2008 with interest at 8% per year. The note was secured by NetSapiens’ proprietary Starter Platform License and SNAPsolution modules. On June 26, 2008 Digerati converted the outstanding interest and principal balance into a lifetime and perpetual NetSapiens’ License. The License provides Digerati with the ability to offer Hosted PBX (Private Branch eXchange), IP Centrex application, prepaid calling, call center, conferencing, messaging and other innovative telephony functionality necessary to offer standard and/or custom services to enterprise markets. The NetSapiens’ License, in the amount of $150,000, is being amortized equally over a period of 10 years. For the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, amortization totaled approximately $15,000 and $15,000, respectively.
NOTE 4 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
Following is a summary of Digerati’s property and equipment at July 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):
 

 | Useful lives | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
-------------------------------+--------------+------+-----+---+------+--
Telecom equipment & software | 1-5 years | $ | 16 | | | $ | 14 | 
Less: accumulated depreciation | | | (14 | ) | | | (11 | )
Net–property and equipment | | $ | 2 | | | $ | 3 | 

 
For the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, depreciation totaled approximately $3,000 and $3,000, respectively.
 
NOTE 5 – INCOME TAXES
 
Digerati files a consolidated tax return. The current tax year is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2017, Digerati had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $3,664,000 to reduce future federal income tax liabilities; the loss carryforwards will start to expire in 2020. Income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

The effective tax rate for Digerati is reconciled to statutory rates as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | 2017 | | | 2016
Expected Federal benefit (provision), at statutory rate | | 35.0 | % | | 35.0 | % 
Change in valuation allowance | | (35.0 | )% | | (35.0 | )%
 | | 0.0 | % | | 0.0 | % 

 
Deferred tax assets are comprised of the following as of July 31, 2017 and 2016:
 

 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
------------------------------+------+------------+---+------+--
Net operating loss carryover | $ | 1,282,000 | | | $ | 358,000 | 
Valuation allowance | | (1,282,000 | ) | | | (358,000 | )
Total deferred tax asset, net | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
At July 31, 2017, realization of Digerati’s deferred tax assets was not considered likely to be realized. The change in the valuation allowance for 2017 was approximately $924,000. Management has evaluated and concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in Digerati’s combined financial statements. The current year remains open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which Digerati is subject to tax. The Company files a calendar year return and the net operating loss was adjusted for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017.

We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluate on new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.
 
NOTE 6 – MISCELLANEOUS GAIN 
 
The Company received a tax refund in July 2015. The Company recorded the funds as an accrued liability until such time as it could determine the proper accounting for the refund. Subsequent to its receipt, management has determined that the Company is the legal owner of the refund which has been recorded as a miscellaneous gain during fiscal 2017. The refund did not result from taxes paid by the Company and will not be taxed as it originated from the Internal Revenue Service.
NOTE 7 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Commitments 
 
Digerati leases its office space with monthly payments of $583; the lease is on a month to month basis. The annual rent expense under the operating lease was $6,996 and $7,740, for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The future minimum lease payment under the operating lease for fiscal year 2017 is $6,996.

NOTE 8 – STOCK -BASED COMPENSATION 
 
In November 2015, Digerati adopted the Digerati Technologies, Inc. 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan authorizes the grant of up to 7.5 million stock options, restricted common shares, non-restricted common shares and other awards to employees, directors, and certain other persons. The Plan is intended to permit Digerati to retain and attract qualified individuals who will contribute to the overall success of Digerati. Digerati’s Board of Directors determines the terms of any grants under the Plan. Exercise prices of all stock options and other awards vary based on the market price of the shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The stock options, restricted common stock, non-restricted common stock and other awards vest based on the terms of the individual grant.
 
During the period ended July 31, 2017, we issued:
 

- | 1,003,970 common shares to various employees as part of the Company’s profit sharing plan contribution. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $241,000 equivalent to the value of the shares calculated based on the share’s closing price at the grant dates.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During fiscal 2017 Digerati's board of directors granted 1,170,000 options to purchase Common Shares to directors and employees, with an exercise price of $0.24 per share, an average vesting period of 2 years and weighted average remaining contractual life 4.5 years. The Black-Scholes pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of the options to purchase Common Shares granted during the period, using the assumptions of a risk-free interest rate of 1.73%, dividend yield of 0%, volatility of 245%, and an expected life of 5 years. The options have a fair value of approximately $226,000. Unamortized compensation cost totaled $88,000 and $0, respectively as of July 31, 2017 and July 31, 2016.
