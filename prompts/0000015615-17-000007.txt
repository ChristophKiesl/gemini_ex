ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

We are a leading infrastructure construction company operating mainly throughout North America across a range of industries. Our primary activities include the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of communications, energy and utility infrastructure, such as: wireless, wireline/fiber, satellite communications and customer fulfillment activities; petroleum and natural gas pipeline infrastructure; electrical utility transmission and distribution; conventional and renewable power generation; and industrial infrastructure. Our customers are primarily in these industries. Including our predecessor companies, we have been in business for more than 85 years. We offer our services primarily under the MasTec service mark and, as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 15,400 employees and 510 locations. We have been consistently ranked among the top specialty contractors by Engineering News-Record for the past several years.
We provide our services to a diversified base of customers. We often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system. Revenue from non-recurring, project specific work may experience greater variability than master service agreement work due to the need to replace the revenue as projects are completed. If we are not able to replace work from completed projects with new project work, we may not be able to maintain our current revenue levels or our current level of capacity and resource utilization. We actively review our backlog of project work and take appropriate action to minimize such exposure.

We have diversified our business and expanded our geographic footprint in recent years, both organically and through acquisition, which has deepened our presence and broadened our service offerings in key markets, including: wireless services; wireline/fiber; customer fulfillment; natural gas and petroleum pipeline infrastructure; power generation, including renewables; and electrical transmission, among others. We seek to grow organically and through acquisition, in order to broaden our geographic presence, and to expand the services we provide within our traditional business areas.
We manage our operations under five operating segments, which represent our five reportable segments: (1) Communications; (2) Oil and Gas; (3) Electrical Transmission; (4) Power Generation and Industrial and (5) Other. This structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our labor-based construction services.
The Communications segment performs engineering, construction, maintenance and customer fulfillment activities related to communications infrastructure, primarily for wireless and wireline/fiber communications and install-to-the-home customers, and, to a lesser extent, distribution infrastructure for electrical utilities, among others. We perform engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries through our Oil and Gas segment. The Electrical Transmission segment primarily serves the energy and utility industries through the engineering, construction and maintenance of electrical transmission lines and substations. The Power Generation and Industrial segment primarily serves energy, utility and other end-markets through the installation and construction of conventional and renewable power facilities, related electrical transmission infrastructure, ethanol/biofuel facilities and various types of industrial infrastructure. The Other segment includes equity investees, the services of which vary from those provided by our four primary segments, as well as other small business units that perform construction and other services for a variety of international end-markets.

Industry Trends
Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies that provide services to customers in a range of industries. We believe the following industry trends affect demand for our services: 
Oil and Natural Gas Infrastructure Opportunities
 We believe that we are one of the leading pipeline contractors in North America, and have a balanced portfolio of service offerings, including the construction and maintenance of large diameter (“long-haul”) pipeline, midstream pipeline, gathering lines and related compressor and pumping stations and treatment plants. We anticipate that future demand for pipeline infrastructure in North America will provide significant opportunities for pipeline infrastructure construction and that our diverse capabilities and expertise will enable us to continue to be a leading service provider in this market. While the oil and natural gas markets have experienced significant volatility from fluctuations in commodity prices in recent years, we believe that the global economy will continue to depend on oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which we believe will generate continued opportunities for pipeline infrastructure in the future.
The level of oil and natural gas pipeline construction activity in North America has grown significantly in recent years as a result of technological advances, which have significantly increased producible North American oil and natural gas reserves. According to the Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) Annual Energy Outlook 2017, increased levels of oil and natural gas production could lead to the U.S. becoming a net exporter of energy by 2026. These technological advances have changed the geographic sources of U.S. production and caused an increase in demand for lower cost oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure for the long-distance transportation of this production to refining centers, distribution hubs and industrial users throughout the U.S. In addition, according to the DOE Annual Energy Outlook 2017, natural gas has surpassed coal as the predominant fuel source in 2015 and is the leading fuel type for electric power generation, creating expanded opportunities for new pipeline infrastructure throughout North America. We expect that these trends will create a multi-year cycle of demand for pipeline construction projects. 
In addition to potential opportunities in the U.S., Mexico has implemented energy regulation reforms to authorize and attract foreign investment in the energy sector in order to expand and revitalize Mexico’s energy industry, with public and private infrastructure investments already underway. 
5

These initiatives call for a significant shift from fuel oils to more environmentally sensitive and cleaner natural gas, including a program for the long-term importation of natural gas from the U.S. to provide for cleaner and more economical electrical power generation and energy usage. MasTec is currently constructing two pipelines to move U.S. sourced natural gas to the Mexico / U.S. border. We believe there will be additional pipeline infrastructure opportunities for the import of U.S. natural gas to Mexico as well as within Mexico. 
Communications, Install-to-the-Home and Customer Fulfillment End Market Opportunities 
Demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services has increased significantly due to increased mobile consumer and business usage of data, video and voice transmission, including from video and music download services, high definition television, mobile television streaming, home security, home automation and other advanced data services. As a result of these developments, data usage over wireless and wireline/fiber networks is rapidly increasing, requiring upgraded capacity and performance of communications networks. In its 2017 Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, Cisco Systems, Inc. predicted that global mobile network connection speeds will increase three-fold, and that mobile data traffic will increase almost seven-fold by 2021, with an expected compound annual growth rate of almost 50%. Wireless carriers have responded to this growing demand with continued expansion of 4th generation (“4G”) wireless service as well as accelerated development and testing of new 5th generation (“5G”) wireless technology. Wireline/fiber carriers have responded to this growing demand by expanding fiber-to-the-home deployment with 1-Gigabit-per-second high-speed internet connectivity. Fiber-to-the-home deployment across North America is expected to significantly expand over the next several years, having experienced record growth over the past three years. We believe that these market dynamics will require major carriers to invest significant capital expenditures for the future deployment of 5G technology, as well as the expansion and upgrade of wireline/fiber networks to 1-Gigabit speeds. We believe that we are well positioned as one of the largest providers of these services to significantly benefit from these opportunities.
 In the install-to-the-home and customer fulfillment markets, we believe that growth opportunities will be driven by continued expansion of DIRECTV® subscribers, as well as from customers seeking to expand their service offerings in the areas of customer fulfillment, home security and home automation. 
Electrical Power Transmission and Distribution Opportunities 
The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to manage power line congestion and avoid delivery failures. Also, regional shifts in population and industry may also create pockets of demand for increased transmission and distribution construction and upgrades. Expected electrical grid expansions in Canada and Mexico may create additional opportunities for contractors that provide electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure services. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2017, approximately 250 gigawatts of new electricity generating capacity is expected to be added through 2050. In 2015, The Brattle Group estimated that during the next decade, approximately $120 to $140 billion in transmission investment will be made by electric utility companies. 
Renewable energy generation projects, which are typically in remote areas, may require investment in new transmission lines to interconnect with the electrical grid. In addition, efforts to modernize, secure and visually improve the existing transmission system are expected. We believe significant capital investment in the transmission and distribution system will continue to be required to meet these needs, and MasTec is well positioned in this sector.
Renewable Power Generation Opportunities
Governmental policy focused on a clean environment, coupled with clean air and climate change legislation, regulation and agreements, as well as the desire to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports, have created demand for more domestic, environmentally sensitive electrical power production, such as wind and solar collection farms. Currently, almost 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals. The DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2017 projected approximately 70 gigawatts of new wind and solar capacity from 2017 to 2021. In addition, according to the same study, greenhouse gas emission regulations, demand and standards for energy efficiency, renewable tax incentives and the projected continued decline in the cost of renewable resources are expected to continue to incentivize construction of renewable resources throughout North America. We have expertise in wind, solar and industrial plant construction and expect to continue to be a leading player in renewable energy infrastructure projects. 
The renewable energy industry is heavily reliant on federal and state tax incentives, which have limited terms.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (“CAA”) extended certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, which contains federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry.  Currently, the tax code provides that the production tax credit for wind projects (the “PTC”) applies to qualifying projects for which the construction commencement date was prior to January 1, 2020. The PTC will be reduced by 20% for 2017, by 40% for 2018, and finally will be reduced by 60% for 2019. Similarly, a phase down rate of the investment tax credit (the “ITC”) in lieu of PTC is available for wind projects: 30% ITC for projects commencing before 2017, 24% for projects commencing in 2017, 18% for projects commencing in 2018 and 12% for projects commencing in 2019. Solar projects, however, will be eligible for an investment tax credit (the “Solar ITC”) only. The Solar ITC is 30% for projects commencing prior to 2020 and is reduced to 26% for projects commencing in 2020 and to 22% for projects commencing in 2021. After 2021, the Solar ITC will permanently remain at 10% for projects that commence prior to 2022, but are placed in service after 2023. Other tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry include accelerated tax depreciation provisions, including bonus depreciation, for certain renewable energy generation assets, such as equipment using solar or wind energy or energy from geothermal deposits or biomass. These incentives provide for a five-year depreciable life for qualifying assets rather than the longer depreciable lives of many non-renewable energy assets. In addition to a shorter depreciable life, those assets qualifying for bonus depreciation benefit from significant allowable first-year depreciation.
We believe that we are one of the leading renewables contractors in North America and we expect to benefit from these trends.

See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - The renewable energy industry is heavily reliant on tax incentives, the availability of which may be uncertain and could adversely affect demand for our services.”
Heavy Industrial Opportunities 
Industrial plant construction opportunities exist in a wide variety of industries. The low price of natural gas is expected to spur the construction of new gas-fired electrical generating plants, conversions of coal-fired power plants to cleaner natural gas and the construction of other plants which use natural gas as a fuel source or chemical feedstock. Industrial facilities and plants that support the biofuels, food processing, natural gas, petroleum and related industries present opportunities as additional domestic energy reserves are produced, transported and processed. 
Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths include: 
Diverse Customer Relationships. We serve a diversified customer and industry base. Our customers include some of the largest communications, utility and power generation companies in North America. We have longstanding relationships and have developed strong alliances with many of our customers, and we strive to maintain these customer relationships and our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. 
Reputation for Reliable Customer Service and Technical Expertise. We have established a reputation for quality customer service and technical expertise. Our reputation gives us an advantage when competing for new work, both from existing and potential customers. In addition, we have broad capabilities and expertise in a wide variety of service offerings, including wireless, wireline/fiber and customer fulfillment activities, pipeline, electrical utility, power generation and heavy industrial infrastructure. 
North American Footprint. Including our predecessor companies, we have been in business for more than 85 years and are one of the largest companies in the infrastructure construction services industry, with approximately 510 locations and 15,400 employees, operating throughout North America, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada and Mexico. We offer comprehensive end-to-end infrastructure services to our customers and believe that our experience, technical expertise, geographic reach and size are important to our customers. 
Ability to Respond Quickly and Effectively.  The skills required to serve our end-markets are similar, which allows us to utilize qualified personnel across multiple end-markets and projects. We are able to respond quickly and effectively to industry and technological changes, demand and major weather events by allocating our employees, fleet and other assets as and where they are needed, enabling us to provide cost effective and timely services for our customers. 
Experienced Management Team. Our management team plays a significant role in establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers, supporting the growth of our business, integrating acquired businesses and managing the financial aspects of our operations. Our chief executive officer, chief operating officer and business unit presidents have broad industry experience and a deep understanding of our customers and their requirements. Generally, key management personnel of acquired businesses continue to work for us under employment or services agreements. 
Socially Responsible Investing
We are committed to socially responsible investing and corporate practices. We are one of the largest renewables contractors in North America, having constructed a significant percentage of North America’s wind farms. Our renewables business also builds solar power plants. We are also committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. In our largest fleet operation, we have developed sophisticated routing, scheduling and fuel management programs that significantly reduce our consumption of fuel. In addition, as part of our effort to reduce our overall carbon footprint, we have invested in equipment that is equipped with advanced emissions reduction technologies. We also have recycling programs for discarded materials and programs for the proper disposition of hazardous wastes. 
 In our Oil and Gas segment, we perform engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries. In many cases, we are helping consumers and customers access cleaner burning natural gas by providing transportation infrastructure for businesses and consumers that wish to switch to these cleaner burning and lower carbon fuel sources. We also provide state-of-the-art pipeline transportation options, which consume fewer hydrocarbons in the transportation process than do traditional truck and rail transport.
We seek to align the interests of our Board of Directors and management with that of our shareholders. We believe that an independent, well-diversified Board makes us a better corporate citizen, and we have a Board with racial, ethnic, gender and skill diversity.  We also believe that our separation of Chairman and CEO further enhances accountability and social responsibility. Our management team and our Board of Directors also have significant ownership in MasTec’s common stock, which further aligns their interests with those of our other shareholders.  
We have detailed governance procedures, including an Audit Committee Charter, a Compensation Committee Charter and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, as well as a comprehensive Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Director and Communication Principles and Board of Director Governance Principles, all of which can reviewed on the “Investors” page of our website at MasTec.com.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 
Focus on Growth Opportunities. We believe that our end-markets offer multiple growth opportunities, and we expect continued spending by key customers in many of the industries we serve. We expect development of oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure, wireless and wireline/fiber 
7

infrastructure, expansion and upgrades of electrical transmission capacity and the distribution grid, development of power generation infrastructure, including renewable energy sources, and heavy industrial projects to be areas of investment and opportunity in the coming years. We intend to use our broad geographic presence, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, customer relationships and full range of services to capitalize on these trends and grow our business. 
Operational Excellence. We seek to improve our profit margins and cash flows by focusing on profitable services and projects that have high margin potential. We also strive to identify opportunities for leverage within our business, such as deploying resources across multiple customers and projects in order to enhance our operating effectiveness and utilization rates, while continuing to maintain strong working capital management practices. We continue to pursue actions and programs designed to achieve these goals, such as increasing accountability throughout our organization, effectively managing customer contract bidding procedures, evaluating opportunities to improve our working capital cycle time through contractual provisions and certain financing arrangements, hiring and retaining experienced operating and financial professionals, and expanding and further integrating the use of our financial and other management information systems.
Maintain Conservative Capital Structure. We evaluate our capital structure on an ongoing basis and have expanded our financial resources in recent years. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our planned operations and had approximately $406 million of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016. We have aggregate borrowing commitments under our senior secured credit facility of $1.2 billion and $400 million principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023. We may consider opportunities to borrow additional funds, or to refinance, repurchase or retire outstanding debt or repurchase equity in the future as part of our ongoing capital structure evaluation. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Senior Secured Credit Facility,” for details pertaining to the February 2017 amendment to our senior secured credit facility, which increased our borrowing commitments from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. 
Leverage Performance and Core Expertise Through Strategic Acquisitions, Arrangements and/or Selected Divestitures. We may pursue selected acquisitions, investments and strategic arrangements that allow us to expand our operations into targeted geographic areas or continue to expand our service offerings in related fields. We have diversified our business and expanded our service offerings and geographic footprint in recent years, both organically and through acquisition. Our strategy includes timely and efficient integration of acquisitions to best fit into our internal control environment and to maximize the potential of acquired businesses. We may also divest certain businesses or assets due to their performance and/or fit within our long-term business strategy.
Services
Our core services are the engineering, building, installing, maintaining and upgrading of infrastructure for communications, utility and power generation customers. We provide similar services to each of these customers, including: 
Build. We build infrastructure projects for customers across a range of industries. We specialize in building underground and overhead distribution systems, including trenches, conduits, cable and power lines, which provide wireless and wireline/fiber communications; natural gas, crude oil and refined product transport pipelines; electrical power generation, transmission and distribution systems; power generation infrastructure, including renewable energy; heavy industrial plants; and compressor and pump stations and treatment plants.
Install. We install electrical and other energy distribution and transmission systems, power generation facilities, buried and aerial fiber optic cables, coaxial cables, copper lines, satellite dishes, home security and home automation in a variety of environments for our customers. In connection with our installation work, we deploy and manage network connections that involve our customers’ hardware, software and network equipment. 
Maintain and Upgrade. We offer 24 hour/365 days-a-year maintenance and upgrade support to our customers. Our comprehensive service offerings include the regular maintenance of our customers’ distribution facilities, networks and infrastructure, including natural gas and petroleum pipeline, communications, electrical distribution and transmission and power generation infrastructure. We also provide emergency services for accidents or storm damage. Our upgrade work ranges from routine replacements and upgrades to major overhauls. 
Customers
We have longstanding relationships with many customers, and often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. Our master service agreements are typically exclusive up to a specified dollar amount per work order for each defined geographic area, but do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. Work performed under master service and other service agreements is usually generated through work orders, each of which is performed for a fixed fee. Services provided under these agreements range from engineering, project management and installation work to maintenance and upgrade services. Master service and other service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bidding basis, although customers are sometimes willing to negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re-bidding. Our master service and other service agreements have various terms, depending upon the nature of the services provided, and typically provide for termination on short or no advance notice. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 43%, 48% and 49% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from projects performed under master service and other service agreements. 
The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system. Customers are billed with varying frequency, generally monthly or upon attaining specific milestones. Such contracts may include retainage provisions under which, generally, from 5% to 10% of the contract price is withheld from us until the work has been completed and accepted by the customer. 
We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. See Note 13 - Segments

and Related Information and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for significant customer concentrations. 
Backlog 
Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog also includes amounts under master service and other service agreements and includes our proportionate share of estimated revenue from proportionately consolidated non-controlled joint ventures. Estimated backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. We expect to realize approximately 80% of our estimated year end 2016 backlog in 2017. The following table presents 18-month backlog by reportable segment, as of the dates indicated:

Reportable Segment (in millions): | December 31, 2016 | | September 30, 2016 | | December 31, 2015
Communications | $ | 2,824 | | | $ | 3,125 | | $ | 3,138
Oil and Gas | 2,223 | | | 1,134 | | | 2,006
Electrical Transmission | 257 | | | 269 | | | 252 
Power Generation and Industrial | 109 | | | 116 | | | 265 
Other | 6 | | | 7 | | | 13 
Estimated 18-month backlog | $ | 5,419 | | | $ | 4,651 | | $ | 5,674

 Approximately half of our backlog as of both December 31, 2016 and 2015 is attributable to amounts under master service or other service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services. Most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer delays, regulatory factors and/or other project-related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. In the past, we have occasionally experienced postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements due to changes in our customers’ spending plans, as well as on construction projects, due to market volatility and regulatory factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. 
Backlog is not a term recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”); however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. 
Sales and Marketing
Our customers increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines. Therefore, our subsidiary services companies market their services not only individually, but also in combination with other companies, including other MasTec companies and independent companies, to provide what we believe are the most efficient and effective solutions to meet our customers’ demands. Through our unified MasTec® brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of labor, equipment and materials, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs. We offer services that are branded under the MasTec® service mark and other service marks. 
We have developed a marketing plan emphasizing the MasTec® registered service mark and trade names of certain acquired companies, as well as an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions, providing services including installation as well as sophisticated engineering, design and integration. We believe our longstanding relationships with customers and our reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business. Our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our business units and project groups in coordination with our corporate business development organization. Our management team has many years of industry experience, both at the service provider level, and in some cases, with the customers we serve. Our business unit and project group managers market directly to existing and potential customers for new contracts and also seek our inclusion on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects. Our executive management supplements these efforts at the national and international level. 
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
We strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees, and we require that our employees participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise. Our business units have established robust safety programs to monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations. 
Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we are subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. Our insurance policies are subject to high deductibles and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. We maintain insurance policies for workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability that are subject to per claim deductibles. We also maintain excess umbrella coverage and an insurance policy with respect to employee group medical claims. We are required to post letters of credit and provide cash collateral to certain of our insurance carriers and to provide surety bonds in certain states. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference.

Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital 
Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation of, but not the cost or warranty of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent on any one vendor and have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required for the projects we manage. 
We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We are not dependent on any one independent contractor. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, such as the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work and the spending patterns of our customers, both of which influence the timing of associated spending to support related customer demand. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Working Capital,” which is incorporated by reference. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms. The national or large regional firms that compete with us include Quanta Services, Inc., MYR Group, Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., Pike Electric, Inc., Willbros Group, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Bechtel Corporation, D.H. Blattner & Sons, Inc., M.A. Mortenson Company, General Dynamics, Black & Veatch and Nexius.
Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including adequate financial resources, technical expertise, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. Some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation, our safety record and customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process. Consequently, price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected. 
Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight. 
As a contractor, our operations are subject to various laws, including: 

• | regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”);


• | regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and state equivalents; 


• | contractor licensing requirements;


• | permitting and inspection requirements; and


• | building and electrical codes.

We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.” 
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, we could incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
Financial Information About Geographic Areas 
We operate throughout North America, primarily in the United States and Canada, and, to a lesser extent, in Mexico. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 15,400 employees, approximately 600 of whom were represented by unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements. See Note 10 - Other Retirement Plans in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
10

We hire employees from a number of sources, including our industry, trade schools, colleges and universities. Our primary sources for employees include promotion from within, team member referrals, direct recruiting and print and internet advertising. We attract and retain employees by offering competitive salaries, technical training opportunities, bonus opportunities, stock ownership and a comprehensive benefits package. We believe that our focus on training and career development helps us to attract and retain employees. Our employees participate in ongoing educational programs, many of which are internally developed, to enhance their technical and management skills through classroom and field training. We provide opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization, which we also believe helps us to retain our employees. We believe we have good employee relations.
