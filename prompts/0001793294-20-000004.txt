In 2019, we served all of the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies in the world, as ranked by 2018 research and development (“R&D”) spending, and, in 2018, were involved in 66 drug approvals. We also participated in the development of all of 2018’s top ten selling drugs, as ranked by 2018 revenue. Since 2014, we have also worked with over 300 companies in the growing biotechnology sector through our PPD Biotech model, which was built specifically to serve the unique needs of this customer segment. We have two reportable segments, Clinical Development Services and Laboratory Services.
Our purpose and mission are to improve health by helping our customers deliver life-changing therapies to patients. We pursue our purpose and mission through our clinical development and laboratory services and our strategy to bend the cost and time curve of drug development and optimize value for our customers.
Our customers benefit from accelerated time to market because it results in lengthened periods of market exclusivity, and our real-world evidence solutions support the superior efficacy and health economics of their novel therapies. We believe our medical, scientific and drug development expertise, along with our innovative technologies and knowledge of global regulatory requirements help our customers accelerate the development of safe and effective therapeutics and maximize returns on their R&D investments.
Our service offerings include both clinical development and laboratory services. Our clinical development services include all phases of development (i.e., Phase I-IV), peri- and post-approval and site and patient access services. Our laboratory services offer a range of high-value, advanced testing services, including bioanalytical, biomarker, vaccine, good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) and central laboratory services. We have deep experience across a broad range of rapidly growing areas of drug development and engage with customers through a variety of commercial models, including both full-service and functional service partnerships and other offerings tailored to address the specific needs of our customers.
We have developed significant expertise in the design and execution of complex global clinical trials, a result of conducting studies on global, national, regional and local levels across a wide spectrum of therapeutic areas for more than 30 years and in over 100 countries. Our customers entrust us to design, execute and deliver results on some of the most critical aspects of the drug development process for the key assets in their pipelines.

As of December 31, 2019, we had more than 23,000 employees worldwide, approximately 5,100 of whom hold advanced degrees, and we had 100 offices in 46 countries. Over the last five years, we have conducted more than 2,100 clinical trials, and our laboratory scientists have completed more than 57,000 pharmaceutical development projects and worked with more than 7,600 compounds. Among other elements, our ability to successfully assess feasibility in the context of study design, recruit for increasingly specialized patient populations and devise optimal regulatory strategies is essential to our competitive advantage in winning new studies. 
Our deep understanding of the drug development process has allowed us to effectively invest in and evolve our service offerings to meet the needs of our customers. We have developed a differentiated site and patient access capability, built a delivery model for biotechnology companies, invested in advanced laboratory testing, broadened the scope of our peri- and post-approval services and expanded our global presence. Specific examples of some of our recent initiatives and investments include:

• | Innovative site and patient access. We have developed differentiated capabilities that meaningfully address two of the biggest challenges that our customers face: patient enrollment and site performance. Through our Accelerated Enrollment Solutions (“AES”) delivery model, we focus on meeting the unique feasibility, site start-up and patient recruitment needs of each study. We address these complex needs by leveraging (i) large data sets, including identified and consented personal data on 100 million U.S. households and health information on approximately 20 million previously screened study candidates and (ii) our global site network of over 180 research sites across five continents and 17 countries.


• | Purpose-built PPD Biotech. Over the past five years, we pioneered the development, implementation and scaling of a purpose-built, customer-facing delivery model to address the specific needs of the increasingly relevant biotechnology sector. Our model is founded on (i) dedicating commercial, medical, operational and functional leaders to our biotechnology customers and (ii) allocating the right mix of experienced resources to drive their drug development programs.


• | Advanced laboratory services. Over the last five years, in response to strong customer demand for our services (over $1 billion of laboratory services in our backlog as of December 31, 2019), we have invested over $200 million to significantly increase the size and operating capacity of our laboratory facilities, acquire innovative laboratory equipment, expand our test menus and build out differentiated IT systems and laboratory automation.


• | Innovative peri-and post-approval studies. Our customers increasingly require evidence-based solutions to help them demonstrate the real-world effectiveness, safety and value of newly approved therapies, which are essential to optimize the commercial potential of their products. We have significantly expanded our capabilities in this growing area, providing our customers with service offerings in areas such as (i) market access, (ii) health economics modeling and (iii) patient-centered research.


• | Targeted geographic expansion. We maintain a strong presence of experienced professionals in all key regions and countries necessary to support our customers’ global drug development programs. In response to the growing importance of conducting global studies that include cohorts in Japan and China and the opportunity to serve local customers in those geographies with their global drug development needs, we have significantly increased the size and scale of our operations in those countries while maintaining the quality and operating standards demanded by our customers and regulatory authorities alike.

We believe these investments in our businesses and our innovative solutions have enhanced the strength of our clinical development and laboratory services and further differentiated our offerings from other clinical development organizations, providing us with meaningful competitive advantages and growth opportunities.
Our Industry
The drug development process involves the testing of drug candidates to demonstrate safety and efficacy in order to meet regulatory requirements. Developing new drugs for the treatment of human disease is an extremely expensive, complex, high-risk and time-consuming process. It is estimated that bringing a new drug or medical device to market can take up to 15 years and cost $2.5 billion or more.
5

The Drug Development Process
The drug development process consists of two stages: pre-clinical and clinical. In the pre-clinical stage, the new drug candidate is tested in vitro and in vivo in animals, generally over a one- to three-year period, to assess and optimize potential use in humans. After successful pre-clinical testing and receipt of required regulatory authorizations, the new drug candidate can be advanced to the clinical development stage, which involves testing in humans. As we do not participate in the pre-clinical market, the following discussion describes the clinical drug development process in the context of the U.S. regulatory framework. The clinical drug development process and regulatory frameworks in other countries can vary from the United States framework, but in many ways are substantially similar.
Prior to commencing human clinical trials in the United States, a company must file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) an investigational new drug application (“IND”) containing information about animal toxicity and distribution studies, manufacturing and control data, stability data, a clinical development plan and a study protocol for the initial proposed clinical trial. The design of these trials, described in the study protocols, is essential to the success of the drug development effort. The studies are designed to generate the type of clinical data that will support the development of the drug candidate and, ultimately, potentially support regulatory approval. An IND must become effective in order for human clinical trials to begin. If the FDA does not place the IND on clinical hold within 30 days after an IND filing, human clinical trials may begin upon expiration of the 30-day period or upon earlier notification by the FDA that the clinical investigations may begin.
The clinical stage is the most time-consuming and expensive part of the drug development process. During the clinical stage, the drug candidate undergoes a series of tests in humans, including healthy volunteers, as well as participants with the targeted disease or condition. Human trials usually start on a small scale to assess safety, efficacy and dosage (Phase I-II) and then expand to larger trials (Phase III) to test efficacy and safety in the target population. These trials are generally conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase I trials involve testing the drug candidate on a limited number of healthy individuals, typically 20 to 80 people, to determine the drug candidate’s basic safety data, including tolerance, absorption, metabolism and excretion. This phase lasts an average of six months to one year. In some therapeutic areas such as oncology, where cytotoxic compounds are being investigated, it is sometimes necessary to run Phase I trials in diagnosed patients instead of healthy individuals.


• | Phase II trials involve testing a small number of volunteer participants, typically 100 to 200 people, who suffer from the targeted disease or condition, to assess the drug candidate’s effectiveness and how different doses work. This phase lasts an average of one to two years.


• | Phase III trials involve testing large numbers of participants, typically several hundred to several thousand people, to evaluate efficacy on a large scale, as well as long-term safety. These trials involve numerous sites and generally last two to three years, but can be shorter or longer.


• | Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials involve monitoring or verifying the risks and benefits of a drug product.


• | Real-world data and evidence studies, meaning data and evidence gathered outside of the context of clinical trials, are often used to assess usage, potential benefits or risks, safety, effectiveness and health economics to achieve successful market access and product uptake.

Our Markets
As of December 31, 2019, our total addressable market was greater than $51 billion, consisting of clinical development services, including peri- and post-approval services and site and patient enrollment services, and laboratory services. We believe the clinical development services (Phase I–III), or clinical research organization (“CRO”), market to be an approximately $20.4 billion market as of December 31, 2019 and expect this market to continue to grow at an average annual growth rate of approximately 6-9%. We have expanded our capabilities in the $10.0 billion Phase IV and peri- and post-approval services market, which we anticipate will grow at an annual growth rate of approximately 6-7%. Our AES delivery model has allowed us to participate in the economics and growth of the investigator and patient recruitment market that otherwise would represent pass-through revenues, as it does for most other CROs. We expect this to be an approximately $10.4 billion market and anticipate it to grow at an annual growth rate of approximately 5-6%. In addition to competing in the CRO market, through our strategic investments we have strengthened our position in the laboratory services market and expanded our addressable market to include the markets for investigator and patient recruitment and peri- and post-approval services. In laboratory services, in addition to the $4.3 billion central laboratory market, we compete in the $6.0 billion market for advanced laboratory testing, which we anticipate will grow at an annual growth rate of 7-8%.

We believe there are five key trends affecting our end markets that will create increasing demand for our offering of services:

• | Growth in R&D spending. Biopharmaceutical companies must continually invest in drug development in order to create innovative new therapies or use existing drugs to treat new indications, to address unmet medical needs and to replace lost revenues when their currently marketed drugs lose patent protection. From 2008 to 2018, R&D spending increased approximately 3.3% annually, driven by long-term secular fundamentals including a 30% increase in active INDs and an approximately 80% increase in average annual FDA approvals from 2008 to 2018.


• | Increased levels of outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies. As biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek ways to reduce clinical development costs and focus resources on core competencies, we believe they will continue to increase the amount of clinical development work they outsource to CROs. Outsourcing penetration as a percentage of total development spending by biopharmaceutical companies increased from approximately 36% in 2007 to approximately 49% in 2018. Drivers of increased outsourcing include:


• | biopharmaceutical companies’ desire for flexible cost structures and focus on core competencies;


• | experience, expertise, capability and value provided by CROs;


• | difficulty conducting large, global and complex clinical trials required by the current regulatory environment;


• | ability to generate real-world data and evidence; and


• | desire to address declining R&D productivity by utilizing more efficient means of conducting clinical trials.


• | Increased complexity in clinical development. Clinical trials continue to increase in complexity due to a confluence of factors including, but not limited to, (i) new therapeutic modalities, (ii) the collection of more clinical trial endpoints, (iii) more specific patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, (iv) ever-changing regulatory requirements and (v) an expansion of evidence generation methods, such as electronic patient-reported outcomes and virtual clinical trials. All of these factors result in more complex trial design, challenges in enrolling protocol-eligible patients, longer duration of clinical trials and greater overall clinical trial cost. As a result, we expect biopharmaceutical companies to increasingly seek partners that have the experience and expertise to conduct cost-effective clinical studies. In particular, we believe large CROs who possess scale, geographic reach and differentiated capabilities to manage the complexity of clinical trials will continue to grow at a higher rate and take market share versus the overall industry.

• | Biotechnology sector growth. The U.S. biotechnology sector has grown rapidly over the last decade and has emerged as a key customer segment for the drug development services industry. The rate of biotechnology companies’ R&D spending growth has been higher than that of traditional pharmaceutical companies in recent years, and we believe that over the last five years, innovative biotechnology companies have accounted for approximately 40% of new drug approvals (“NDAs”). This has largely been fueled by a robust funding environment, both public and private, with over $150 billion of capital raised for biotechnology companies in the last three years. Today, we believe the majority of biotechnology companies have enough cash on hand to fund R&D expenditures for two to three years. Many biotechnology companies are smaller, discovery research-focused organizations that do not find it economically attractive to invest in the infrastructure and personnel necessary to conduct their clinical development programs on their own, and we believe they will continue to rely on CROs, like us, for their global drug development needs.


• | Increasing importance to prove value of new therapies. As participants in the healthcare industry are increasingly focused on managing costs, biopharmaceutical companies need to find alternatives to align market constituents on the value of their treatments. The ability to perform peri- and post-approval studies to transform real-world data (such as medical claims data or electronic medical records) into real-world evidence provides biopharmaceutical companies a solution to quantify the value of new therapies to market constituents. Real-world data and evidence enable biopharmaceutical companies to develop better therapies and optimize the commercial potential of their new therapies. With increased R&D activity and competition among newly approved therapies in similar indications, we anticipate the continued adoption of real-world data and evidence to demonstrate the value of new medicines.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well-positioned to serve the global biopharmaceutical industry in obtaining the approval for, and maximizing the market access and value of, their new medicines. We differentiate ourselves from others in our industry through our competitive strengths, which include:

Differentiated Clinical Development Services
Building on our solid foundation, we have invested heavily in recent years to further strengthen our competitive position through differentiated clinical development solutions designed to address our customers’ needs and bend the time and cost curve of their clinical trials. Our key clinical development investments include:

• | Study start-up. We have acquired and embedded leading technologies and tools in our global start-up processes to (i) improve feasibility by helping our customers assess trial viability quickly and effectively and (ii) reduce study start-up timelines. Due to the substantial costs and investments associated with clinical trial starts, our ability to reduce key cycle times to below-industry averages addresses a critical need of our customers. For example, our median cycle time from final protocol received (“FPR”) to first site activated is more than 10% faster than industry benchmark cycle times. Similarly, our median time from FPR to the milestone of 50% of sites activated is more than 10% faster than industry benchmarks. This accelerated site activation, coupled with our clinical operations, has also resulted in significantly improved patient enrollment timelines: FPR to first patient, first visit is more than 10% faster and FPR to 50% patients enrolled is more than 30% faster than benchmarks.


• | Accelerated Enrollment Solutions: Our AES delivery model aligns the fundamental components of the clinical trial execution process and extends across five continents, 17 countries and over 180 research sites. In the past five years, AES has participated in over 750 studies, including trials conducted by us, our customers and other CROs. Since 2013, we have deployed over $600 million making strategic acquisitions and bringing together complementary capabilities to create a delivery model which would be difficult to replicate. We believe our AES delivery model represents the industry’s largest aggregation of fully identified data on individuals who have provided their consent and indicated an interest in participating, or have participated, in clinical trials. With our AES delivery model, we are able to provide significant flexibility to our customers, giving them the ability to engage us for (i) discrete components of our AES service offerings, (ii) the full suite of AES capabilities or (iii) wholly integrated constructs which combine our AES offerings with our clinical development services. Through this model, we have been able to deliver compelling value propositions to our customers, including:


◦ | significant percentages (e.g., 30% - 80%) of their trial enrollment with fewer sites, in less time and under one contract and uniform procedures and quality standards; and


◦ | significantly faster start-up times and higher enrollment rates than the independent site model.

Our Growth Strategy
The key elements of our growth strategy to help our customers bend the cost and time curve of drug development include:
Further Strengthen Our Offerings in Existing and New Markets
Our global footprint, scale, integrated systems and deep scientific expertise enable us to conduct complex, multi-center clinical trials simultaneously throughout the world. We have a well-established presence in all of the major biopharmaceutical markets, including the United States, Europe and Asia, with nearly 3,800 professionals in the latter region and scale and differentiation in Japan and China, two countries of increasingly strategic importance for drug development programs. As a result, we continue to gain share within the CRO market as biopharmaceutical customers continue to look for strategic partners with global scale and service offerings to conduct complex global trials. We plan to further strengthen our leadership position by investing in geographies that are critical to address the needs of our customers and their drug development pipelines.
Expand Leading Therapeutic Expertise in Existing and Novel Areas
We have amassed deep scientific expertise in the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. In addition, we have developed specific capabilities in disciplines that cross therapeutic areas, such as rare diseases, vaccines and a broad array of chronic conditions. Over 75% of total R&D spend on late stage clinical trials conducted from 2015 through 2018 related to hematology/oncology and chronic conditions. Over the last five years, we have performed a significant amount of work in both of these areas, having provided services in over 500 hematology/oncology studies and over 1,000 chronic condition studies in the last five years.
11

We are also conducting significant work in growing areas of R&D innovation, such as immuno-oncology, which has experienced a 91% increase in the number of drugs in development since 2017, and cell and gene therapy, for which the industry pipeline of drugs has more than tripled since 2014. In addition, customers are hiring us to run their programs in other areas of innovative R&D, such as ADC’s, ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) interference, messenger RNA and others. We intend to continue investing in our scientific and operational capabilities to further strengthen our leadership position in key therapeutic areas and position ourselves to take advantage of the evolving trends in the biopharmaceutical industry.
Build Upon Our Existing Dedicated Biotech Offering
Over the last five years, innovative biotechnology companies focused on new and complex therapies have accounted for approximately 40% of NDAs and have driven significant growth in related R&D spending. Large biopharmaceutical companies have had to fill gaps in their pipelines through strategic collaborations with, and acquisitions of, biotechnology companies, further increasing growth in the number of innovative, complex and global clinical trials. We were at the forefront of realizing these trends and formed our dedicated PPD Biotech model in 2014. Since that time, we have more than doubled PPD Biotech annual authorizations and grown revenue by over 80%. We continue to leverage our sophisticated customer development activities within PPD Biotech, which include early identification of novel molecules and extensive pre-trial consultative advisory engagement with customers, to optimally position ourselves to win new business. PPD Biotech’s success is evidenced by the increase in our win rates from biotechnology companies whereby we have increased our average win rate from approximately 26% in 2016 to over 40% in 2019. We believe that our track record of serving biotechnology companies through our PPD Biotech model has earned us a reputation as the strategic partner of choice. Since the beginning of 2014, we have worked with some of the most innovative companies to help bring disease-modifying therapies to the market for patients. We believe our differentiated offering will enable us to continue to capture share within the biotechnology market.
12

Increase Use of Our Innovative Site Network and Patient Enrollment Platform
Through our AES delivery model, we have developed an approach to directly serve our customers’ needs by addressing patient enrollment and site performance challenges, which are two of the biggest challenges our customers face in clinical development. We believe our integrated strategy of using technology and identified and consented data, our global site network and support for leading independent sites, is the ideal approach to serving our customers. To date, AES has played a critical role in completing some of the most important and complex clinical trials for our customers. We plan to continue to build out our AES capabilities and further strengthen the value propositions we offer and deliver to our customers through this differentiated model.
In addition to providing us with a competitively advantaged asset, our AES delivery model is financially attractive as it allows us to participate in the economics and growth of the market for investigator and patient recruitment services that otherwise would represent pass-through revenues, as is the case for most other CROs.

Our corporate marketing team supports the activities of our business development staff. Our global marketing initiatives include integrated, multi-channel campaigns designed to help differentiate and promote our expertise and services and strengthen our corporate brand. We provide our perspective on current industry challenges and developments to create an ongoing dialogue with our customers and prospective customers and to promote our scientific expertise, differentiated service offerings, quality, technology and innovation. In support of these efforts, we exhibit, provide speakers, present papers and host customer meetings at key industry events, and publish scientific articles in industry, trade, medical and pharmaceutical journals.
Backlog and Authorizations
Our backlog represents anticipated direct revenue for work not yet completed or performed (i) under signed contracts, letters of intent and, in some cases, awards that are supported by other forms of written communication and (ii) where there is sufficient or reasonable certainty about the customer’s ability and intent to fund and commence the services within six months. Our backlog excludes anticipated third-party pass-through and out-of-pocket revenue.
Backlog and backlog conversion to direct revenue vary from period to period depending upon new authorizations, contract modifications, cancellations and the amount of direct revenue recognized under existing contracts. The weighted-average duration of contracts in our backlog fluctuates from period to period based on the contracts constituting our backlog at any given time. We adjust backlog for foreign currency fluctuations and exclude direct revenue that has been recognized as revenue in our statements of operations.
Although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in future direct revenue to be recognized over time (depending on future contract modifications, contract cancellations and other adjustments), an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond to an increase in direct revenue during a particular period. The timing and extent to which backlog will result in direct revenue depends on many factors, including the timing of commencement of work, the rate at which we perform services, scope changes, cancellations, delays, receipt of regulatory approvals and the nature, duration, size, complexity and phase of the studies. Our contracts generally have terms ranging from several months to several years. In addition, delayed projects remain in backlog until they are canceled. As a result of these factors, our backlog might not be a reliable indicator of future direct revenue and we might not realize all or any part of the direct revenue from the authorizations in backlog as of any point in time. Our backlog was $7,066.3 million at December 31, 2019 and $6,313.7 million at December 31, 2018.
We add new authorizations to backlog based on the aforementioned criteria for backlog. New authorizations vary from period to period depending on numerous factors, including customer authorization volume, sales performance and overall health of the biopharmaceutical industry, among others. New authorizations have and will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. Once work begins, we recognize direct revenue over the life of the contract based on our performance of services under the contract. Our net authorizations were $3,827.3 million, $3,421.0 million, and $2,485.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Competition
The drug development services industry is highly competitive, consisting of hundreds of small, limited-scope service providers and a limited number of large full-service global development companies. While the industry has seen an increasing level of consolidation over the past several years, largely driven by the larger full-service providers, it remains highly fragmented.
Our Clinical Development Services segment competes primarily with a small number of other global, full-service CROs, although we also compete against small and medium-sized niche CROs, in-house R&D departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities and teaching hospitals. We generally compete on the basis of scientific and therapeutic experience, project team expertise, qualifications and experience, ability to recruit patients, price, quality and the ability to innovate to achieve time and cost savings for our customers, amongst other factors. Our major competitors include IQVIA Holdings, Inc. (“IQVIA”), ICON plc (“ICON”), PAREXEL International Corporation, PRA Health Sciences, Inc. (“PRA Health Sciences”), the Covance Drug Development business of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (“Covance”), Syneos Health, Inc. (“Syneos Health”) and Medpace Holdings, Inc.
Our Laboratory Services segment competes primarily with the laboratory businesses of other large CROs, large global laboratory organizations, specialty laboratories and in-house laboratories of biopharmaceutical companies. We generally compete on the basis of testing capability, scientific and therapeutic experience, global footprint, price, quality and speed. Our major competitors include the advanced and central laboratory segments of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings and Syneos Health, Q2 Solutions, ICON, Eurofins Scientific, WuXi AppTec, BioAgilytix and SGS.
We believe that our competitive position is generally strong and that we are able to effectively compete in both the clinical development and laboratory services markets.

Intellectual Property
In the course of conducting our business, we have developed, and continue to develop and use proprietary software, systems, processes, databases and other intellectual property. We seek to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets through confidentiality agreements with employees, customers and other third parties, as well as administrative and technical safeguards. We rely on patent, copyright and trademark laws, as may be appropriate and applicable, to protect our other intellectual property rights. For example, we have applied for and/or obtained and maintain registration in the United States and other countries for numerous trademarks, including PPD®, PPD® Biotech, PPD® Laboratories and Preclarus®. We also enter into agreements with third-parties for the license and use of their intellectual property, although no one such license is considered to be material to the business as a whole. We do not have any material patents.
Government Regulation
Regulation of Drugs and Biologics
The development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution and post-approval monitoring and reporting of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, including the FDA, as well as those of other countries, such as the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) in the European Union and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) in the United Kingdom. These regulations apply to our customers and are generally applicable to us when we are providing services to our customers, either as a result of their direct applicability, through a transfer of regulatory obligations from our customers, or as a consequence of acting as local legal representative on behalf of our customers in a particular country or countries. Consequently, we must comply with all relevant laws and regulations in the conduct of our Clinical Development Services and Laboratory Services segments. The following discussion describes the role of the FDA in the clinical drug development process in the United States. Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protections of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other materials. FDA laws and regulations may apply to clinical studies conducted outside the United States if, for example, such studies are conducted under an IND or offered as support for an IND.
Prior to commencing human clinical trials, a company developing a new drug must file an IND with the FDA. The IND must include information about pre-clinical tests, manufacturing and control data, and a study protocol for the proposed clinical trial of the drug in humans. If the FDA does not object in writing within 30 days after filing the IND becomes effective and the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with an effective IND.
The study protocol must also be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board/independent ethics committee (“IRB/IEC”) for each institution in which a study is proposed to be conducted and each IRB/IEC may impose additional requirements on the conduct of the study in its institution. IRB/IECs have the authority to review, approve and monitor clinical trials, and clinical trials are subject to oversight by IRB/IECs. The industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials is embodied in the FDA’s regulations for IRB/IECs, investigators and sponsor/monitors, which regulations collectively are termed Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) by industry, and the GCP guidelines issued by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”), which have been agreed upon by industry and regulatory representatives from the United States, the European Union and Japan. GCP requirements address, among other things, IRBs, qualified investigators, informed consent, recordkeeping and reporting. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP requirements through periodic inspections, and violations of GCP requirements could result in enforcement actions including the issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, product recalls, criminal prosecutions or debarment from involvement in the submission of NDAs. Our global standard operating procedures are written in accordance with all applicable FDA, EMA, MHRA, ICH and GCP requirements. This enables our work to be conducted locally, regionally and globally to standards that meet all currently applicable regulatory requirements. We must also maintain reports in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for each study for auditing by the customer and regulatory authorities.
In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, sponsors of clinical trials must, among other things:

• | comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified investigators;


• | obtain specific written commitments from the investigators;


• | obtain IRB review and approval of the clinical trial;


• | verify that appropriate patient informed consent is obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;


• | ensure adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;

18


• | monitor the validity and accuracy of data;


• | maintain records regarding drug or biologic dispensing and disposition;


• | instruct investigators and study staff to maintain records and reports; and


• | permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.

If a clinical trial is not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the applicable regulatory agency may require that a clinical trial be modified, suspended or terminated, and we or our customers may be subject to a variety of sanctions. For example, violations could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning or untitled letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. IRBs may also suspend or terminate research not conducted in accordance with IRB requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
After receiving IRB/IEC approval, clinical trials usually start on a small scale to assess safety and then expand to larger trials to test both efficacy and safety in the target population. The trials are generally conducted in three phases (Phase I, II and III), which may overlap or be combined, although the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily conduct, a fourth phase of clinical trials (Phase IV) as a condition of approval or to obtain additional data on the product under investigation, respectively. After the successful completion of the first three clinical phases, a company requests approval for marketing its product by submitting an NDA for a drug or a biologics license application (“BLA”) for a biologic product. NDAs/BLAs are a comprehensive, multivolume filings that include, among other things, the results of all preclinical and clinical studies, information about how the product will be manufactured, additional stability data and proposed labeling. The FDA’s review may last from several months to several years. Once the NDA/BLA is approved, the product may be marketed in the United States, subject to any conditions imposed by the FDA as part of its approval. The FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”). REMS may be required by the FDA for certain products where serious safety concerns exist in order to help ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks.
Regulation of Testing Facilities
Laboratories such as ours that provide information included in INDs, NDAs, BLAs and other regulatory submissions must conform to regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the testing process and data. For example, our bioanalytical laboratories follow the GLP requirements adopted by the FDA, the Ministry of Health in the United Kingdom and by similar regulatory authorities in other countries, as applicable. Our product analysis laboratories follow the GMP requirements adopted by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Both GLPs and GMPs require standardized procedures for all equipment, processes and analytical tests, for recording and reporting data, and for retaining appropriate records. To help ensure compliance with GLPs and GMPs, we have established standard operating procedures, working practice documents and processes, and have quality assurance personnel at our laboratory facilities to audit test data and inspect testing procedures, laboratory equipment and facilities.
In addition, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of study subjects must comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (the “CLIA”). The CLIA requires laboratories to meet staffing, proficiency and quality standards, and governs laboratory accreditation, inspection and certification. Our testing facility in Austin, Texas and our central laboratory in Highland Heights, Kentucky are CLIA-certified. A failure to comply with CLIA requirements may expose laboratories to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Non-compliant laboratories may also have their CLIA certificate suspended, limited, or revoked. These laboratories are also subject to applicable U.S. state laboratory requirements and to accreditation bodies governing their testing and reporting functions, including the CAP, CDC LSP and NGSP. Our central laboratories in Highland Heights, Kentucky, Brussels, Belgium, Singapore and Shanghai, China are all accredited by CAP.
Regulation of Personal Information
We hold confidential personal health and other information relating to persons who have been, are and may in the future be involved in clinical trials or otherwise. The possession, retention, use and disclosure of such information is highly regulated, both in the United States and the other jurisdictions we are subject to, including but not limited to, applicable regulations arising from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and the Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, 45 C.F.R. Parts 160-164, that implement those laws; U.S. state privacy, security and breach notification and healthcare information laws; and the E.U. General Data Protection Directive (the “GDPR”). The GDPR places restrictions on the export of personal data outside the European Union.
19

These regulations govern the use, handling and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information and require the use of standard transactions, privacy and security standards and other administrative simplification provisions by covered entities, which include many healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Although certain of our businesses are subject to HIPAA, we do not consider our service offerings generally to cause us to be subject to HIPAA as a directly covered entity; however, there are extremely limited circumstances where we enter into business associate agreements. However, we endeavor to embrace sound identity protection practices and have implemented standard contractual clauses with our customers, affiliates and vendors to satisfy data export requirements and safeguards regarding the creation, receipt, maintenance and transmission of protected health information. We maintain a global privacy policy and employ dedicated privacy professionals who work closely with our senior executive leadership as part of our efforts to address applicable privacy laws.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous additional national laws, rules and regulations, including those enforced by the following U.S. agencies:

• | Occupational Safety and Health Administration;


• | Nuclear Regulatory Commission;


• | Environmental Protection Agency;


• | Department of Transportation;


• | International Civil Aviation Organization;


• | Department of Health and Human Services; and


• | U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”).

Our laboratories registered with the DEA may receive and manage controlled substances for research purposes. The DEA regulates controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act and other laws and the regulations that implement such laws. The DEA requirements include obligations related to recordkeeping, security, handling, diversion and disposal of controlled substances. If we fail to comply with the DEA requirements regarding controlled substances, our registration may be suspended or revoked or renewal of our registration may be denied, and we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, injunctions or other enforcement actions. Our laboratories listed below are registered with the DEA:

• | clinical pharmacology unit in Austin, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada;


• | bioanalytical laboratories in Middleton, Wisconsin and Richmond, Virginia; and


• | GMP laboratory in Middleton, Wisconsin.

Our laboratory in Athlone, Ireland is registered with the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority and may receive and manage controlled substances.
We also must comply with other related international, federal, state and local regulations that govern the use, handling, disposal, packaging, shipment and receipt of certain drugs or unknown compounds, chemicals and chemical waste, toxic substances, biohazards and biohazard waste, and radioactive materials and radioactive waste. In order to comply with these regulations, we have established standard operating procedures, and provide appropriate equipment and training to our employees involved in these activities.
Any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research, the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities, fines and other sanctions, as well as liability to our customers. Furthermore, any issuance of a notice of finding by a governmental authority against either us or our customers, based upon a material violation by us of any applicable regulation, could materially and adversely affect our reputation and business.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect the pharmaceutical industry, which, in turn, could affect our business. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), was signed into law. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular importance to the pharmaceutical industry, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research and establishes a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
20

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the ACA’s individual mandate is unconstitutional because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act modified the individual mandate so that it could no longer constitute a tax and remanded the case to a U.S. district court in Texas to determine if the remainder of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what the effect of this decision and subsequent decisions and appeals will have on the ACA and our business. Litigation over the ACA is likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. Legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, and proposed and enacted legislation and regulations designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference-pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. Any of these judicial, legislative or regulatory developments could harm our customers’ businesses, which could cause them to reduce their spending on research and development, which, in turn, could negatively impact our business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed more than 23,000 employees. Approximately 54% of our employees are located outside of the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia. Of our staff, approximately 5,100 hold advanced, masters or equivalent degrees. Some of our employees located outside the United States are represented by works councils or labor unions, and/or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.
Indemnification and Insurance
Our business exposes us to potential liability including, but not limited to, potential liability for (i) breach of contract or negligence claims by our customers, (ii) non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations and (iii) third-party claims in connection with our performance of drug development services (for example, patient claims for personal injury). In certain circumstances, we may also be liable for the acts or omissions of others, such as suppliers of goods or services.
We attempt to manage our potential liability to third-parties through contractual protection (such as indemnification and limitation of liability provisions) in our contracts with customers and others, and through insurance. The contractual indemnification provisions vary in scope and generally do not protect us against all potential liabilities, such as liability arising out of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, in the event that we seek to enforce such an indemnification provision, the indemnifying party may not have sufficient resources to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or may otherwise not comply with its contractual obligations.
We generally require our customers and other counterparties to maintain adequate insurance, and we currently maintain errors, omissions and professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe to be appropriate. This insurance provides coverage for vicarious liability due to the negligence of the investigators who contract with us, as well as claims by our customers that a clinical trial was compromised due to an error or omission from us. The coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims made and such claims may be contested by applicable insurance carriers.
