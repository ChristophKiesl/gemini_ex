Item 1. Business
In this Form 10-K, unless otherwise specified, “Luby’s,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “Company” refer to Luby’s, Inc., Luby's Fuddruckers Restaurants, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company ("LFR") and the consolidated subsidiaries of Luby’s, Inc. References to “Luby’s Cafeteria” refer specifically to the Luby’s Cafeteria brand restaurant.
Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution
At a special meeting of stockholders held on November 17, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the Company’s Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation” or the “Plan”) that provides for the sale of the Company’s assets and distribution of the net proceeds to the Company’s stockholders, after which the Company will be dissolved. 
The Plan of Liquidation outlines an orderly sale of the Company's businesses, operations, and real estate, and an orderly wind down of any remaining operations. The Company intends to attempt to convert all of its assets into cash, satisfy or resolve its remaining liabilities and obligations, including contingent liabilities and claims and costs associated with the liquidation of the Company, and then file a certificate of dissolution. The assets to be sold include operating divisions Luby’s Cafeterias, Fuddruckers, and the Company’s Culinary Contract Services business, as well as the Company’s real estate. The Company currently anticipates that its common stock will be delisted from the NYSE upon the filing of the certificate of dissolution, which is not expected to occur until the earlier of the completion of the asset sales or three years, but the delisting of its common stock may occur sooner in accordance with applicable rules of the NYSE. 
The Company cannot predict the timing or amount of any distributions to stockholders, as uncertainties exist as to the value it may receive upon the sale of assets pursuant to its monetization strategy, the net value of any remaining assets after such sales are completed, the ultimate amount of expenses associated with implementing its monetization strategy, liabilities, operating costs and amounts to be set aside for claims, obligations and provisions during the liquidation and winding-up process and the related timing to complete such transactions and overall process.
The Company does not intend to comment on or disclose developments regarding the process unless it deems further disclosure appropriate or required. Please see "Risk factors" in Item 1A.

Fuddruckers Franchising
Fuddruckers offers franchises in markets where it deems expansion to be advantageous to the development of the Fuddruckers concept and system of restaurants.

Franchise agreements typically grant franchisees an exclusive territorial license to operate a single restaurant within a specified area, 
usually a four-mile radius surrounding the franchised restaurant. All franchisees are required to operate their restaurants in accordance with Fuddruckers standards and specifications, including controls over menu items, food quality and preparation.
