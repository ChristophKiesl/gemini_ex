ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
We are one of the largest regional amusement park operators in the world with 13 properties in our portfolio consisting of amusement parks, water parks and complementary resort facilities. We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1987 and managed by Cedar Fair Management, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "General Partner"), whose shares are held by an Ohio trust. 
Our parks are family-oriented, with recreational facilities for people of all ages, and provide clean and attractive environments with exciting rides and immersive entertainment. Our parks include: Cedar Point, located on Lake Erie between Cleveland and Toledo in Sandusky, Ohio; Knott's Berry Farm, near Los Angeles, California; Canada's Wonderland, near Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Kings Island, near Cincinnati, Ohio; Carowinds, in Charlotte, North Carolina; Kings Dominion, near Richmond, Virginia; California's Great America, in Santa Clara, California; Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom ("Dorney Park"), in Allentown, Pennsylvania; Worlds of Fun, in Kansas City, Missouri; Valleyfair, near Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; Michigan's Adventure, in Muskegon, Michigan; Schlitterbahn Waterpark & Resort New Braunfels in New Braunfels, Texas; and Schlitterbahn Waterpark Galveston in Galveston, Texas. We manage and operate Gilroy Gardens Family Theme Park in Gilroy, California. With limited exceptions, all rides and attractions at the parks are owned and operated by us. 
Our parks operate seasonally except for Knott's Berry Farm, which is typically open daily on a year-round basis. Our seasonal parks are generally open during weekends beginning in April or May, and then daily from Memorial Day until Labor Day. After Labor Day, our seasonal parks are open during select weekends in September and, in most cases, in the fourth quarter for Halloween and winter events. As a result, a substantial portion of our revenues from these seasonal parks are typically generated during an approximate 130- to 140-day operating season with the major portion concentrated in the third quarter during the peak vacation months of July and August. 
The demographic groups that are most important to our business are families and young people ages 12 through 24. Families are believed to be attracted by a combination of rides, live entertainment and the clean, wholesome atmosphere. Young people are believed to be attracted by the action-packed rides. We conduct active television, radio, newspaper and internet advertising campaigns in our major market areas geared toward these two groups.
IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a material impact on our business in 2020 and is expected to have a continuing negative impact into 2021. Most significantly, we closed our properties for several months in 2020 beginning on March 14. We ultimately resumed partial operations at 10 of our 13 properties in 2020, operating in accordance with local and state guidelines. Due to soft demand trends upon reopening, park operating calendars were adjusted for 2020, including reduced operating days per week and operating hours within each operating day. In 2021, we anticipate reopening our seasonal parks in May 2021 and offering new culinary festivals at Knott's Berry Farm beginning in March 2021. With broad vaccination distribution efforts in process and anticipated pent-up demand for outdoor entertainment, management is focused on maximizing the seasonally weighted second half of 2021. We do not anticipate 2021 to be a normal operating year operationally or financially, and it is uncertain how long it may take us to achieve full operational potential. Our future operations are dependent on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL
We believe that annual park attendance is influenced by annual investments in our properties, including new attractions and infrastructure, among other factors. Capital expenditures are planned on a seasonal basis with most expenditures made prior to the beginning of the peak operating season. Capital expenditures made in a calendar year may differ materially from amounts identified with a particular operating season because of timing considerations such as weather conditions, site preparation requirements and availability of ride components, which may result in accelerated or delayed expenditures around calendar year-end. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, some capital expenditures were suspended in order to maintain flexibility and retain liquidity. The timing and amount of capital expenditures may differ from typical calendar years while the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue.
During the operating season, we carry significant receivables and inventories of food and merchandise, as well as payables and payroll-related accruals. These amounts are typically substantially reduced in non-operating periods. Seasonal working capital needs are typically funded from current operations and revolving credit facilities. Revolving credit facilities are typically established at levels sufficient to accommodate our peak borrowing requirements in April and May as the seasonal parks complete preparations for opening. Revolving credit borrowings are then typically reduced with our positive cash flow during the seasonal operating period.
COMPETITION
We compete for discretionary spending with all aspects of the recreation industry within our primary market areas, including other destination and regional amusement parks. We also compete with other forms of entertainment and recreational activities, including movies, sports events, restaurants and vacation travel. 
The principal competitive factors in the amusement park industry include the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides and attractions in a particular park, proximity to metropolitan areas, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park, and the quality and variety of the food and immersive entertainment available. We believe that our parks feature a variety of high quality rides and attractions, restaurants, gift shops and family atmosphere to make them highly competitive with other parks and forms of entertainment.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements, such as those relating to employment practices, environmental requirements, and other regulatory matters. We are subject to extensive federal and state employment laws and regulations, including wage and hour laws and other pay practices and employee record-keeping requirements. We may be required to incur costs to comply with these requirements, and the costs of compliance, investigation, remediation, litigation, and resolution of regulatory matters could be substantial.
We also are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations such as those relating to water resources; discharges to air, water and land; the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials. Under these laws and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases from current or formerly owned or operated facilities or to mitigate potential environmental risks. Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the relevant entity knew of or 
caused the presence of the contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing with respect to our property. 
Currently, we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements under these laws and regulations. However, such requirements have generally become stricter over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future.
All rides are inspected daily by both our maintenance and ride operations personnel before being placed into operation for our guests. The parks are also periodically inspected by our insurance carrier and, at all parks except Valleyfair, Worlds of Fun, Schlitterbahn Waterpark New Braunfels, Schlitterbahn Waterpark Galveston and Carowinds' South Carolina rides, by state or county ride-safety inspectors. Valleyfair, Worlds of Fun, Schlitterbahn Waterpark New Braunfels, Schlitterbahn Waterpark Galveston and Carowinds each contract with a third party to inspect our rides pursuant to Minnesota, Missouri, Texas and South Carolina law, respectively, and submit the third-party report to the respective state agency. Additionally, all parks have added ride maintenance and operation inspections completed by third party qualified inspectors to make sure our standards are being maintained.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We employ approximately 2,700 full-time employees. During the operating season, we typically employ in aggregate approximately 48,000 seasonal and part-time employees, many of whom are high school and college students. Due to park closures and operating calendar changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we employed approximately 27,000 seasonal and part-time employees during 2020. We house some of our seasonal employees in dormitories owned by us at Cedar Point, Kings Island, Carowinds, Kings Dominion and Valleyfair, or rented by us at Dorney Park, Worlds of Fun, Schlitterbahn Waterpark New Braunfels and Schlitterbahn Waterpark Galveston. Approximately 250 of our employees are represented by labor unions. We believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols to protect our employees, including implementing health screening and temperature-taking protocols for employees and guests entering our properties, staggering schedules to allow for greater social distancing, increasing hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures, requiring face coverings where social distancing cannot be maintained, providing incremental personal protective equipment, enabling employees to work from home where possible, and restricting business travel and encouraging quarantine upon return.
Our employee guidelines and policies are founded on our cornerstones of safety, service, courtesy, cleanliness and integrity. We are committed to equal opportunity employment and prohibit harassment or discrimination of any kind. We have adopted an open door policy to encourage an honest employer-associate relationship which includes a confidential hotline available to all employees. 
We maintain training programs for all new employees, including safety training specific to job responsibilities. We participate in the J-1 Visa program providing cultural and educational exchange opportunities for our associates. We also have partnered with Bowling Green State University to create the Cedar Fair Resort and Attraction Management program, a bachelor's degree program, which is housed in downtown Sandusky, Ohio in a facility jointly owned by the Partnership and a third party developer. The bachelor's degree program prepares students for management careers at Cedar Fair parks or a similar establishment. We encourage a promote-from-within policy.
Our executive compensation program is designed to incentivize our key employees to drive superior results, to give key employees a vested interest in our growth and performance, and to enhance our ability to attract and retain exceptional managerial talent. Our executive compensation program rewards both successful individual performance and the consolidated operating results of the Company by directly tying compensation to Company performance.
