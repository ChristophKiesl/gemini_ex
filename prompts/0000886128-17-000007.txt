Background
Information contained in this report concerning the utility industry and the distributed generation market, our general expectations concerning this industry and this market, and our position within this industry are based on market research, industry publications, other publicly available information and on assumptions made by us based on this information and our knowledge of this industry and this market, which we believe to be reasonable. Although we believe that the market research, industry publications and other publicly available information are reliable, including the sources that we cite in this report, they have not been independently verified by us and, accordingly, we cannot assure you that such information is accurate in all material respects. Our estimates, particularly as they relate to our general expectations concerning the electric power supply industry and the distributed generation market, involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors of this report.
As used in this report, all degrees refer to Fahrenheit (“F”); kilowatt (“kW”) and megawatt (“MW”) numbers designate nominal or rated capacity of the referenced power plant; “efficiency” or “electrical efficiency” means the ratio of the electrical energy generated in the conversion of a fuel to the total energy contained in the fuel (lower heating value, the standard for power plant generation, assumes the water in the product is in vapor form; as opposed to higher heating value, which assumes the water in the product is in liquid form, net of parasitic load); kW means 1,000 watts; MW means 1,000,000 watts; “kilowatt hour” (“kWh”) is equal to 1kW of power supplied to or taken from an electric circuit steadily for one hour; and one British Thermal Unit (“Btu”) is equal to the amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of pure water from 59oF to 60oF at a specified constant pressure.
All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
Additional Technical Terms and Definitions 
Availability - A measure of the amount of time a system is available to operate, as a fraction of total calendar time. For power generation equipment, an industry standard (IEEE (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 762, “Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability and Productivity”) is used to compute availability. “Availability percentage” is calculated as total period hours since Commercial Operations Date less hours not producing electricity due to planned and unplanned maintenance divided by total period hours. Grid disturbances, force majeure events and site specific issues such as a lack of available fuel supply or customer infrastructure repair do not penalize the calculation of availability according to this standard.
Baseload - Consistent power generation that is available to meet electricity demands around-the-clock. This differs from peak or peaking power generation that is designed to be turned on or off quickly to meet sudden changes in electricity demand, or intermittent power generation such as solar or wind.
Carbonate Fuel Cell ( or “CFC”) - Carbonate fuel cells, such as the fuel cell power plants produced and sold by FuelCell Energy, are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic-based matrix. CFC's operate at high temperatures, enabling the use of a nickel-based catalyst, a lower cost alternative to precious metal catalysts used in some other fuel cell technologies.
Combined Heat & Power (“CHP”) - A power plant configuration or mode of operation featuring simultaneous on-site generation from the same unit of fuel of both electricity and heat with the byproduct heat used to produce steam, hot water or heated air for both heating and cooling applications.
Commercial Operations Date(COD)- The date that testing and commissioning of the fuel cell project is completed with power being generated and sold to the end-user.
Direct FuelCell® (“DFC®”) - Trademarked product name of FuelCell Energy commercial carbonate fuel cell plants that references the internal reforming process within the fuel cell of a hydrogen-rich fuel source such as natural gas.
Distributed Generation - Electric power that is generated where it is needed (distributed throughout the power grid) rather than from a central location. Centrally generated power requires extensive transmission networks that require maintenance and experience efficiency losses during transmission while distributed generation does not. Distributed generation is small to mid-
6

size power plants, typically 75 megawatts or less. Central generation is large power plants generating hundreds or even thousands of megawatts.
Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) - The net present value of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of a generating asset repaired for a project developer to recover all costs, including capital costs, operations and maintenance costs, financing costs and a reasonable return. 
Micro-grid - Micro-grids are localized electric grids that can disconnect from the traditional electric grid to operate autonomously and strengthen grid resiliency. Micro-grids can be composed only of DFC plants due to their continual power output or combine a variety of different types of power generation such as fuel cells and solar arrays.
Nitrogen Oxides (“NOx”) - Generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many of the NOx are colorless and odorless; however they are a major precursor to smog production and acid rain. However, one common pollutant, Nitrogen Dioxide, along with particles in the air, can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban areas. NOx form when fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion process. The primary manmade sources of NOx are motor vehicles, electric utilities, and other industrial, commercial and residential sources that burn fuels.
Particulate Matter (PM) - Solid or liquid particles emitted into the air that are generally caused by the combustion of materials or dust generating activities. Particulate matter caused by combustion can be harmful to humans as the fine particles of chemicals, acids and metals may get lodged in lung tissue.
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) - A Power Purchase Agreement is a contract that enables a power user to purchase energy under a long-term contract where user agrees to pay a predetermined rate for the kilowatt-hours delivered from a power generating asset while avoiding the need to own the equipment and pay the upfront capital cost. The length of the contract varies, typically ranging from 10 to 20 years. The PPA rate is typically fixed (with an escalation clause tied to consumer price index or similar index), or pegged to a floating index that is on par with or below the current electricity rate being charged by the local utility company.
Renewable Biogas - Renewable biogas is fuel produced by biological breakdown of organic material.  Biogas is commonly produced in biomass digesters employing bacteria in a heated and controlled oxygen environment.  These digesters are typically used at wastewater treatment facilities or food processors to break down solid waste and the biogas is produced as a byproduct of the waste digestion. Biomass may be generated in digesters from agricultural waste, or it can be produced in less controlled fashion by breakdown of waste in landfills. These biogas fuels can be used as a renewable fuel source for DFCs located on site where the biogas is produced with minimal gas cleanup, or they can be processed further to meet pipeline fuel standards and injected into a gas pipeline network, which is termed Directed Biogas.
Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (RSOFC) - Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells are based on solid oxide fuel cell technology and can be operated in electrolysis mode, power generation mode, and alternate between the two.
Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (“SOEC”) - Solid oxide electrolysis cells are based on solid oxide fuel cell technology and operate in reverse, converting electricity into hydrogen. 
Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (“SOFC”) - Solid oxide fuel cells use a hard, non-porous ceramic compound as the electrolyte. Solid oxide fuel cells operate at very high temperatures eliminating the need for costly precious-metal catalysts, thereby reducing cost. The high temperature enables internal reforming of the hydrogen rich fuel source.
Sulfur Oxide (“Sox”) - Sulfur oxide refers to any one of the following: sulfur monoxide, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide. SO2 is a byproduct of various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum contain sulfur compounds, and generate SO2 when burned. Sox compounds are particulate and acid rain precursors.
Overview
We deliver proprietary fuel cell power solutions that enable economic value with the clean and affordable supply, recovery and storage of energy. We serve utilities, industry and municipal power users on three continents with megawatt-class scalable solutions that include utility-scale and on-site power generation, carbon capture, local hydrogen production for transportation and industry, and energy storage. With more than 5.6 million megawatt hours of ultra-clean power produced, FuelCell Energy is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, installing, operating and maintaining environmentally responsible fuel cell power solutions. 
We provide comprehensive turn-key power generation solutions to our customers, including power plant installation, operations and maintenance under multi-year service agreements. We develop projects and also sell direct to customers, providing either a 
7

comprehensive turn-key solution of developing, installing and servicing the fuel cell power plant, or selling the power plant equipment only. For projects that we develop, the end user of the power typically enters into a PPA and we either identify a project investor to purchase the power plant and assume the PPA, or we retain the project and recognize electricity revenue ratably over the term of the PPA. We target large-scale power users with our megawatt-class installations. To provide a frame of reference, one megawatt is adequate to power approximately 1,000 average sized U.S. homes. Our customer base includes utility companies, municipalities, universities, government entities and a variety of industrial and commercial enterprises. Our leading geographic markets are the United States, Germany and through a technology license, South Korea. We are pursuing expanding opportunities in Asia, Europe, and Canada.
Our value proposition is to enable economic value with clean and affordable fuel cell power plants that supply power where consumed. Our products can also be configured for recovery and storage applications. Our solutions are easy-to-site in populated areas as they are very clean, operate quietly and without vibrations, and have only modest space requirements. Fuel cells use an electrochemical process to convert a fuel source into electricity and heat in a highly efficient process that emits virtually no pollutants as the fuel is not burned, generating power that is almost wholly absent of criteria pollutants such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) that causes smog, sulfur dioxide (SOx) that contributes to acid rain, and particulate matter that can aggravate asthma. Locating power generation near the point of use reduces reliance on the transmission grid, leading to enhanced energy security and power reliability. Utilities can minimize or even avoid the cost of transmission or other infrastructure by adopting distributed generation, which saves their ratepayers the cost of installing and maintaining transmission and also avoids the losses associated with transmitting electricity over great distances. Our power plants provide electricity priced competitively to grid-delivered electricity in certain high cost regions and our strategy is to continue to reduce costs, which we believe will lead to wider adoption.
Utilizing our core DFC plants, we are commercializing a tri-generation distributed hydrogen configuration that generates electricity, heat and hydrogen for industrial and/or transportation uses, as well as a fuel cell carbon capture solution for coal or gas-fired power plants. We also are developing and commercializing SOFC plants for adjacent sub-megawatt applications to the markets for our megawatt-class DFC power plants as well as energy storage (RSOFC) applications utilizing hydrogen as an energy carrier. The market potential for these products is sizeable and these applications are complementary to our core products, as they leverage our existing customer base, project development, manufacturing, sales and service expertise.
FuelCell Energy was founded in Connecticut in 1969 as an applied research organization, providing contract research and development. The Company went public in 1992, raising capital to develop and commercialize fuel cells, and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. We began selling stationary fuel cell power plants commercially in 2003. Today we develop turn-key distributed power generation solutions, operate and provide comprehensive service for the life of the asset.
Markets
Vertical Markets
Access to clean, affordable, continuous and reliable power defines modern lifestyles. The ability to provide power cleanly and efficiently is taking on greater importance and urgency in many regions of the world. Central generation and its associated transmission and distribution grid are difficult to site, costly, and generally take many years to permit and build. Some types of power generation that were widely adopted in the past, such as nuclear power or coal-fired power plants, are no longer welcome in certain regions. The cost and impact to public health and the environment of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions impact the siting of new power generation. The attributes of DFC power plants address these challenges by providing virtually emission-free power and heat at the point of use in a highly efficient process that is affordable to consumers.
Our solutions are installed on both sides of the electric meter meaning that we serve on-site markets supplying power directly to the end user, as well as utility-scale projects that supply the power to the electric grid. We target seven distinct markets including:

(1) | Utilities and Independent Power Producers


(2) | Industrial and Process applications


(3) | Education and Health care


(4) | Data Centers and Communication


(5) | Wastewater treatment


(6) | Government


(7) | Commercial and Hospitality

The Utilities and Independent Power Producers segment is our largest vertical market with customers that include utilities on the East and West coast of the United States such as Dominion (NYSE: D), one of the largest utilities in the Unites States: Avangrid Holdings (NYSE: AGR): and NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG), the largest Independent Power Producer (“IPP”) in the Unites States. Our carbon capture demonstration installation will be located at a power plant owned by a subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO). In Europe, utility customers include E.ON Connecting Energies (DAX: EOAN), one of the largest utilities in the world, and 
8

Switzerland-based ewz. The greatest number of installed DFC plants is in South Korea primarily supplying that nation's electric grid, with the fuel cells' heat typically used in district heating systems to heat and cool nearby facilities. Our exclusive technology licensee in South Korea is POSCO Energy Co., LTD. (“POSCO Energy”), a subsidiary of South Korean-based POSCO (NYSE: PKX), one of the world's largest steel manufacturers.
Our DFC power plants are producing power for a variety of industrial, commercial, municipal and government customers including manufacturing, pharmaceutical processing, universities, healthcare facilities and wastewater treatment facilities. These institutions desire efficient, ultra-clean continuous power to reduce operating expenses, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid pollutant emissions to meet their sustainability goals, while achieving secure and reliable on-site power. Combined heat and power fuel cell applications further support economic and sustainability initiatives by minimizing or avoiding use of combustion based boilers for heat. 
Our products are fuel flexible, utilizing clean natural gas and renewable biogas generated by the customer on-site or directed biogas, generated at a distant location and transported via the existing gas network. In addition, we have demonstrated other fuel sources including coal syngas and propane.
As renewable technologies such as wind and solar power are deployed more widely, the need for a clean, continuous power generation that complements and balances these intermittent sources becomes greater to maintain grid stability or consistent power supply for on-site applications. Our installed base includes a number of locations where our customers use DFC plants for meeting power needs that complements their intermittent wind and/or solar power generation.
Our fuel cell solutions are well suited for micro-grid applications, either as the sole source of power, or integrated with other forms of power generation. We can model, install and operate the micro-grid, which is a differentiator in the power industry. We have fuel cells operating and under construction as micro-grids at universities and municipalities. Under normal operation, the fuel cell will supply power to the grid. If the grid is disrupted, the fuel cell will automatically disconnect from the grid and power a number of critical buildings. 
Wastewater treatment facilities, food and beverage processors, and agricultural operations produce biogas as a byproduct of their operations. Disposing of this greenhouse gas can be harmful to the environment if released into the atmosphere or flared. Our DFC power plants convert this biogas into electricity and heat efficiently and economically. By doing so, DFC plants transform waste disposal challenges into clean energy solutions. The wastewater vertical market is the largest biogas market for DFC power plants. Since our fuel cells operate on the renewable biogas produced by the wastewater treatment process and their heat is used to support daily operations at the wastewater treatment facility, the overall thermal efficiency of these installations is very attractive, supporting economics and sustainability. 
We estimate that the addressable distributed generation market and geographies in which we compete for the supply of energy, including distributed hydrogen production, is approximately a $22 billion opportunity, with approximately 40-45 percent consisting of power plant sales and the remainder representing associated service agreements. We estimate that the addressable market for the recovery of energy, including our fuel cell carbon capture solution and our gas pipeline application is approximately $28 billion, assuming only a 1% penetration rate of addressable coal and gas-fired central generation power plant facilities within the geographies where we do business, and only 25% carbon capture at these coal or gas-fired plants. The addressable energy storage market is still developing as different technologies are beginning to come to market with different approaches to storage and different durations for how long the energy can be stored. We estimate that the addressable market for long duration storage may be in the range of tens of billions of dollars.
Geographic Markets
We target geographic markets with high urban density that value clean distributed generation. We are pursuing a density strategy, targeting markets with the potential for recurring order flow that justifies investment in local service infrastructure. Our target markets currently have regulatory and legislative policy support such as clean air requirements and economic incentives to support the adoption of clean and renewable distributed power generation. Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”) is a mechanism designed to promote the adoption of renewable power generation and is one market enabler of demand for our power generation solutions. Fuel cells can help states meet RPS clean power mandates by generating highly efficient, clean electricity continuously and near the point of use.
North America: We have active business development activities primarily in the Northeast and on the West Coast where high population density, higher energy costs, the need for distributed generation solutions with a small footprint, and public policy support our product offerings. We can rapidly respond to market demands and construct utility scale plants in less than a year. Most of our installed base in the USA is located in California and Connecticut, both of which have enacted RPS programs. As states look to meet their RPS requirements and utilities further deploy distributed generation to meet consumer demand and improve 
9

the resiliency of their service network, we see significant opportunities to grow our U.S. footprint. Trends away from central generation to a distributed generation model are supportive of demand and our initiatives to continue to improve affordability are expected to lead to increased adoption. We continue to explore opportunities in Canada as two separate carbon capture engineering studies were announced in 2016 exploring the potential application of fuel cell carbon capture systems for oil sand applications in Alberta, Canada.
Europe: The European power generation market values distributed generation, efficiency and low emissions and represents opportunity for stationary fuel cell power plants. As we promote awareness and grow the adoption of our solutions, we are focusing on three specific geographies, including Germany, as it transitions away from nuclear power generation and works to integrate a significant amount of intermittent power generation capacity; the United Kingdom, as it evaluates how to achieve aggressive carbon reduction goals; and Italy with growing adoption of distributed generation. We are active in other West European countries as well.
We serve the European market from offices in Dresden, Germany and a manufacturing facility in Taufkirchen, Germany. 
South Korea and the Broader Asia Market: Fuel cells are well-suited for South Korea due to the need to import fuel for power generation, ease of siting in populated areas, and high urban density that makes siting transmission more difficult. Intermittent renewable technologies such as solar and wind are not as well suited due to the geography (high urban densities limit available land for power generation) and climate/topography. The South Korean government has made clean distributed generation power sources a priority to support its growing power needs while minimizing additional investment and congestion of the transmission grid. Fuel cells address these needs and have been designated a key economic driver for the country due to their ultra-clean emissions, high efficiency and reliable distributed generation capabilities that are helping South Korea achieve its RPS and electricity generation goals.
The RPS in South Korea requires an increase of new and renewable power generation to 10% by 2024 from 2% in 2012. The program mandates the addition of 0.5% of renewable power generation per year through 2016, which equates to approximately 350 megawatts, increasing to 1% per year through 2022, or approximately 700 megawatts per year. Fuel cells operating on natural gas and biogas qualify under the mandates of the program.
Select Asian markets with high urban densities, lack of domestic fuel sources, movement away from nuclear power, and a need for cleaner power to reduce smog represent market opportunities. Highly efficient fuel cells maximize power output from high cost imported fuel, and do so without the need to add costly transmission. The Asian market is addressed by our South Korean technology licensee, POSCO Energy, as explained in the following section. 
Strategic Alliances
We leverage our core capabilities by forging strategic alliances with carefully selected business partners that bring power generation experience, financial resources, and market access. Our strategic allies typically have extensive experience in developing and selling power generation products. We believe our strength in the development of fuel cell products; coupled with our allies' understanding of broad range of markets and customers, products and services, enhances the sales and development of our products, as well as providing endorsement of our power generation solutions. Our global business allies include:
NRG Energy: In 2013, we entered into a teaming and co-marketing agreement with NRG Energy (“NRG”), encompassing both direct sales to NRG customers in North America as well as sales to NRG, to own the fuel cell power plants and sell the power and heat to the end user under power purchase agreements. NRG owns approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock or approximately 4% of our outstanding shares, extends a $40.0 million revolving construction and term financing facility to FuelCell Energy Finance, LLC ("FuelCell Finance") our wholly-owned subsidiary, and is represented on the FuelCell Energy Board of Directors by the CEO of NRG Yield (NYSE: NYLD). NRG is the largest IPP in the U.S. with approximately 50,000 megawatts of generation capacity and almost three million retail and commercial customers. We are actively marketing with NRG to its existing customer base.
POSCO Energy: We are allied with POSCO Energy, an IPP with 2015 annual revenues of approximately $1.7 billion and a subsidiary of South Korean-based POSCO, one of the world's largest steel manufacturers (NYSE: PKX), with 2015 annual revenue of approximately $51 billion. POSCO Energy owns 2.6 million of our common shares or approximately 7% of our outstanding shares. POSCO Energy has extensive experience in power plant project development, owning and operating power plants in multiple countries and is the largest independent power producer in South Korea.
Our relationship with POSCO Energy has evolved to support Korean market demand for clean distributed generation. The relationship began in 2003 with the sale of a single sub-megawatt demonstration plant and now South Korea has the largest installed 
10

fleet, including a 59 megawatt facility, the world’s largest fuel cell park consisting of 21 DFC3000 power plants. POSCO Energy manufactures in South Korea and sells to the Asian market under a licensing and royalty agreement for DFC power plants and collaborates with the Company on many market and product development initiatives.
Fraunhofer IKTS: The Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS, with its staff of approximately 400 engineers, scientists and technicians, is a world leading institute in the field of advanced ceramics for high tech applications, including fuel cells. The parent organization, Fraunhofer, was founded in 1949 and is Europe's largest application-oriented research organization with an annual research budget of €2 billion (approximately $2.1 billion) and approximately 23,000 staff, primarily scientists and engineers. Fraunhofer maintains more than 60 research centers and representative offices in Europe, USA, Asia and the Middle East.
Our relationship with Fraunhofer IKTS began in 2012 and involves cooperating on research and development of our core fuel cell technology under research contracts. Fraunhofer IKTS contributes its expertise and extensive research and development capabilities with fuel cells and materials science as well as shares its industry and government relationships to support further adoption of fuel cells.
E.ON Connecting Energies GmbH ("E.ON"):  E.ON Connecting Energies is a business unit of E.ON that offers integrated energy solutions for commercial and industrial customers as well as public-sector institutions internationally.  During fiscal year 2015, we executed a Project Development Agreement with E.ON Connecting Energies to offer decentralized CHP solutions with megawatt and multi-megawatt fuel cell power plants to E.ON’s existing and prospective European customer base, via power purchase agreement financing or leasing structures.  The first sale announced under this agreement was a CHP-configured megawatt-class fuel cell plant installation at a German manufacturing company that was commissioned in September 2016.  E.ON Connecting Energies owns the power plant and FuelCell Energy Solutions installs, operates and maintains the plant under a long-term service agreement. With more than 45,000 megawatts of power generation assets, a presence in more than a dozen countries, and more than 56,000 employees, the E.ON Group is one of the world’s largest utilities.
Business Strategy
Our business model consists of growing and expanding diverse revenue streams, selectively utilizing strategic partnerships for market development, financing and cost reductions, protecting and leveraging intellectual property to generate value, and identifying and developing new markets for our core technology. Revenue streams include power plant and component sales; engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) revenue; royalty and license revenue; service revenue including long term service agreements and the sale of power under PPAs; and revenue from public and private industry research contracts under Advanced Technologies.
Our Company vision is to provide ultra-clean, highly efficient, reliable distributed power generation at a cost per kilowatt hour that is less than the cost of grid-delivered electricity in our target markets. We believe we have a clear path to attaining this vision through increased market adoption and continued reduction in the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for our fuel cell projects. 
Market adoption
We target vertical markets and geographic regions that value clean distributed generation, are located where there is a premium to the cost of grid-delivered electricity, and are aligned with regulatory frameworks that harmonize energy, economic and environmental policies. Our business model addresses all three of these policy areas with highly efficient and affordable distributed generation that offers local job creation potential and delivers de-centralized power in a low-carbon, virtually pollutant-free manner. Geographic markets that meet these criteria and where we are already well established include South Korea, the Northeast USA and California. We have also installed and are operating plants in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland and are pursuing further opportunities in Western Europe and certain other states in the United States. We selectively partner with some of the leading power generation companies in our target markets to facilitate demand and deploy our projects.
While the Company has made significant progress with reducing costs and creating markets since the commercialization of our products in 2003, we face two primary challenges in growing the adoption of our distributed power generation solutions, which are (1) the need to further reduce the total cost of ownership, and (2) the continued education and acknowledgment of the value that our solutions provide. The business model for the generation and delivery of electricity for over a century has been central generation, which is large scale power generation in distant locations away from urban areas with transmission and distribution to the end users. Distributed generation enhances existing utility models and it is being embraced in an increasing number of markets to improve grid operations. An example is a 40 MW fuel cell-only request for proposal (RFP) issued by PSEG Long Island in late 2016 that seeks competitive fuel cell projects to address power generation shortfalls in specifically targeted regions 
11

of Long Island. We work with utilities and IPPs to demonstrate how our solutions complement central generation by incrementally adding clean power generation when and where needed. One example of this is our two fuel cell plant sales to European utility E.ON as they seek to operate on both sides of the electric meter and avoid losing customers to growing adoption of distributed generation. We believe that we have a strong business model and strategy, demonstrated project development execution and plant operating performance and strategic relationships with committed businesses which will enable the Company to overcome these challenges and grow into a sustainable business.
Fuel cell power plant ownership structures
Historically, customers generally purchased our fuel cell power plants outright. As the size of our fuel cell projects has grown and availability of project capital improved, project structures have transitioned to predominantly PPAs. Under a PPA, the end-user of the power commits to purchase power as it is produced for an extended period of time, typically 10 to 20 years. End-users may be a university, pharmaceutical company, hospital or a utility. A primary advantage for the end-user is that it does not need to commit its own capital to own a power generating asset yet it enjoys the multiple benefits of fuel cell power generation.
Once the PPA is executed, construction of the fuel cell project can begin. At or around the COD, the project may be sold to a project investor or retained by the Company. If the project is sold, revenue from the product sale is recognized. If the project is retained, electricity sales are recognized monthly over the term of the PPA. 
Our business model is continuing to evolve to meet the needs and opportunities of the market and to best situate ourselves for success. In 2016, we began to retain ownership of certain projects through sale-leasebacks and retaining the PPA and thus keep them on our balance sheet instead of selling them to an end-user customer, investor, or utility. Our decision to retain certain projects is based in part on the strong cash flows these projects can offer to us, the proliferation of power purchase agreements in the industry and the potential access to capital. Retaining PPAs affords the Company with the full benefit of future cash flows under the PPA’s, which is higher than if the projects were sold. Our operating portfolio of retained projects is currently 11.2 MW with an additional 2.8 MW under construction. The Company plans to continue to grow this portfolio in a balanced manner while also selling projects to investors when that presents the best opportunity. 
Levelized Cost of Energy
Our fuel cell projects are delivering power at a rate comparable to pricing from the grid in our targeted markets. Federal and state-level programs that help to support adoption of clean distributed power generation lead to below-grid pricing. We measure power costs by calculating the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) over the life of the project. In order to broaden the appeal of our products, we need to further reduce our LCOE to be below the grid without incentives.
The Company is integrated across substantially the entire value chain for our projects. We innovate, design and own our proprietary fuel cell technology. We develop and execute comprehensive fuel cell turn-key projects or sell direct. We manufacture and install the fuel cell power plants and we then operate and maintain the plants for our customers under long term service agreements. Given this level of integration, there are multiple areas and opportunities for cost reductions. There are four primary elements to LCOE for our fuel cell projects, including 1) Capital Cost, 2) Operations and Maintenance, 3) Fuel, and 4) Cost of Capital. We are actively managing and reducing costs in all four areas as follows:

• | Capital Cost - Capital costs of our projects include cost to manufacture, install, interconnect, and to provide any on-site application requirements such as configuring for a micro-grid and/or heating and cooling applications. We have reduced the product cost of our megawatt-class power plants by more than 60% from the first commercial installation in 2003 through our ongoing product cost reduction program, which involves every aspect of our business including engineering, procurement and manufacturing. Further cost reductions will be primarily obtained from reducing the per-unit cost of materials purchasing from higher volumes, supported by continued actions with engineering and manufacturing cost reductions. We manage an integrated global supply chain with our Asian technology licensee, POSCO Energy so as Asian production leads to increased levels of purchasing from the integrated global supply chain, both FuelCell Energy and POSCO Energy will benefit with reductions in LCOE by obtaining lower pricing tiers from suppliers from the greater combined purchasing volume. On-site, our experienced EPC team has substantial experience in working with contractors and local utilities to safely and efficiently execute our projects and we expect continued cost reduction in this area with experience and continued transition to multi-MW fuel cell parks. In addition to these cost reduction efforts, our technology roadmap includes plans to increase the output of our power plants which will add further value for our customers and reduce LCOE. 


• | Operations and Maintenance - We provide services to remotely monitor, operate, and maintain customer power plants to meet specified performance levels. Operations and maintenance (O&M) is a key driver for power plants to deliver on projected electrical output and revenues for our customers. Many of our service agreements include guarantees for system performance levels including electrical output. While the electrical and mechanical balance of plant (BOP) in our DFC power plants is designed to last over 25 years, the fuel cell modules are currently scheduled for replacement every five years, the price of 

12

which is included in our service agreements. Customers benefit from predictable savings and financial returns over the life of the contract and minimal risk. Our goal is to optimize our customers’ power plants to meet expected operating parameters throughout the plant’s operational life. We expect to continually drive down the cost of O&M with an expanding fleet which will leverage our investments in this area. Additionally, we are actively developing fuel cells that have a longer life, which will reduce O&M costs by increasing our scheduled module replacement period to seven years.

• | Fuel - Our fuel cells directly convert chemical energy (fuel) into electricity, heat, water and in certain configurations, other value streams such as high purity hydrogen. Because fuel cells generate power electrochemically rather than by combusting (burning) fuels, they are more efficient in extracting energy from fuels and produce less carbon dioxide (“CO2”) and only trace levels of pollutants compared to combustion-type power generation. Our power plants operate on a variety of existing and readily available fuels including natural gas, renewable biogas, directed biogas and propane. Our core DFC power plants deliver electrical efficiencies of 47% and hybrid applications and advanced configurations are capable of delivering electrical efficiencies of 60% or greater. In a CHP configuration, our plants can deliver up to 90% total system efficiency, depending on the application. Increasing electrical efficiency and reducing fuel costs is a key element of our operating cost reduction efforts. 


• | Cost of Capital - Most of our MW-scale projects are financed either by the energy user/off-taker that owns the asset or a project investor that owns the asset and sells energy to the off-taker. We are witnessing greater interest in the pay-as-you-go PPA approach by end users that prefer to avoid the up-front investment in power generation assets. Our ability to provide the end-user with financing options or to retain projects that we develop helps to accelerate order flow. Our projects create predictable recurring revenue that is not dependent on weather or time of the day, investment tax credits, accelerated tax depreciation or other incentives. Credit risk is mitigated by contracting with customers with strong credit. In addition, we offer meaningful system-level output performance guarantees over the life of our projects. As a result, cost of capital for our projects has declined over time, partially due to our operating experience. With continued execution, we expect our ability to attract bank credit and financial and project performance credibility to continue to improve, which we expect will lead to further decreases in financing costs. 

Our core fuel cell platform is versatile and part of our strategy is finding new applications for our power generation solution. Advanced Technology Programs, discussed in a following section, identifies and obtains private and government funding sources to commercialize new applications of the power plants, such as distributed hydrogen and carbon capture. Energy storage applications are also being pursued utilizing both carbonate and solid oxide fuel cell technology.
Products
Our core fuel cell products offer ultra-clean, highly efficient power generation for customers including the 2.8 MW DFC3000®, the 1.4 MW DFC1500® and the recently introduced 3.7 MW DFC4000, plus derivations of this core DFC product for specific applications. The plants are scalable for multi-megawatt utility scale applications or on-site CHP generation for a broad range of applications. We can provide a comprehensive and complete turn-key fuel cell project that includes project development, EPC services, O&M and project finance.
Our proprietary DFC carbonate fuel cell technology generates electricity directly from a fuel, such as natural gas or renewable biogas, by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to produce hydrogen. This internal “one-step” reforming process results in a simpler, more efficient, and cost-effective energy conversion system compared with external reforming fuel cells. Additionally, natural gas has an established infrastructure and is readily available in our existing and target markets compared to some types of fuel cells that require high purity hydrogen. The DFC operates at approximately 1,100° Fahrenheit. An advantage of high temperature fuel cells is that they do not require the use of precious metal electrodes required by lower temperature fuel cells, such as PEM and phosphoric acid. As a result, we are able to use less expensive and readily available industrial metals as catalysts for our fuel cell components. In addition, our DFC fuel cell produces high quality byproduct heat (approximately 700°F) that can be utilized for CHP applications using hot water, steam or chiller water for facility heating and cooling.
The DFC product line is a global platform based on carbonate fuel cell technology. Utilizing a standard design globally enables volume-based cost reduction and optimal resource utilization. Our power plants utilize a variety of available fuels to produce electricity electrochemically, in a process that is highly efficient, quiet, and due to the avoidance of combustion, produces virtually no pollutants. Thus, our plants generate more power and fewer emissions for a given unit of fuel than combustion-based power generation of a similar size, making them economical and environmentally responsible power generation solutions. In addition to electricity, our standard configuration produces high quality heat, suitable for making steam or hot water for facility use as well as absorption cooling. System efficiencies can reach up to 90%, depending on the application, when configured for CHP.
13

We market different configurations of the DFC plants to meet specific market needs, including:
Energy Supply

• | On-Site Power (Behind the Meter): Customers benefit from improved power reliability and energy security from on-site power that reduces reliance on the electric grid. Utilization of the high quality heat produced by the fuel cell in a CHP configuration support economics and sustainability goals by lessening or even avoiding the need for combustion-based boilers for heat and their associated cost, pollutants and carbon emissions. On-site CHP power projects generally range in size from a single 1.4 MW DFC1500 to combining multiple 2.8 MW DFC3000 power plants for larger on-site projects. For example, an installation at a pharmaceutical company uses two power plants for 5.6 MW of power and heat production. 


• | Utility Grid Support: The DFC power plants are scalable, which enables siting multiple fuel cell power plants together in a fuel cell park. Fuel cell parks enable utilities to add clean and continuous power generation when and where needed and enhance the resiliency of the electric grid by reducing reliance on large central generation plants and the associated transmission grid. Consolidating certain steps for multiple plants, such as fuel processing, reduces the cost per megawatt hour for fuel cell parks compared to individual fuel cell power plants. Fuel cell park examples include a five plant, 14.9 MW fuel cell park in Bridgeport, Connecticut that is supplying the electric grid, and multiple fuel cell parks in South Korea in excess of 10 megawatts each that supply power to the electric grid and high quality heat to district heating systems, such as a 59 MW installation which consists of 21 power plants, the world’s largest fuel cell park. By producing power near the point of use, our fuel cells help to ease congestion of the electric grid and can also enable the smart grid via distributed generation combined with the continuous monitoring and operation by our service organization. Thus, our solutions can avoid or reduce investment in new central generation and transmission infrastructure which is costly, difficult to site and expensive to maintain. Deploying our DFC power plants throughout a utility service territory can also help utilities comply with government-mandated clean energy regulations and meet air quality standards. Our products can be part of a total on-site power generation solution with our high efficiency products providing continuous power, and can be combined with intermittent power generation, such as solar or wind, or less efficient combustion-based equipment that provides peaking or load following power. 


• | Higher Electrical Efficiency - Multi-megawatt applications: The DFC4000™ (High Efficiency Fuel Cell) system is configured with a series of three fuel cell modules that operate in sequence, yielding a higher electrical efficiency than the standard DFC3000 configuration of two fuel cell modules operating in parallel. The heat energy and unused hydrogen from two fuel cell modules is supplied to the third module, along with some natural gas to generate additional electricity. This high efficiency configuration is designed to extract more electrical power from each unit of fuel with electrical efficiency of approximately 60% and is targeted at applications with large load requirements and limited waste heat utilization such as utility/grid support or data centers. 


• | Distributed Hydrogen: The DFC fuel cells internally reform the fuel source (i.e. natural gas or biogas) to obtain hydrogen. DFC plants can be configured for tri-generation, supplying power, heat and high purity hydrogen. Power output is modestly reduced to support hydrogen generation that can then be used for industrial applications such as metal or glass processing, material handling applications or petrochemicals, or transportation applications. Siting the tri-generation fuel cell plant at a source of biogas such as wastewater treatment facilities, results in renewable hydrogen for transportation, an attractive proposition to regulatory and legislative officials and car companies. After operating two sub-megawatt systems - one for renewable vehicle fueling and one producing industrial hydrogen for our Torrington manufacturing facility - we are now evaluating a variety of possible sites for the first commercial MW-scale application of the technology. 


• | Micro-grid: The DFC plants can also be configured as a micro-grid, either independently or with other forms of power generation. We possess the capabilities to model, design and operate the micro grid and have multiple examples of our DFC plants operating within micro-grids, some individually and some with other forms of power generation. 

Energy Recovery

• | Gas Pipeline Applications: DFC-ERG® (Direct FuelCell Energy Recovery GenerationTM) power plants are used in natural gas pipeline applications, harnessing energy that is otherwise lost during the station’s natural gas pressure-reduction (“letdown”) process. Also, thermal energy produced as a byproduct of the fuel cell’s operation supports the letdown process, improving the station’s carbon footprint and enhancing the project’s economics. Depending on the specific gas flows and application, the DFC-ERG configuration is capable of achieving electrical efficiencies up to 70%. A 3.4 megawatt DFC-ERG system was sold to Avangrid (formerly UIL Holdings) and began operating in Connecticut during 2016. 


• | Carbon Capture: The DFC carbon capture system separates CO2 from the flue gases of natural gas or coal-fired power plants or industrial facilities while producing ultra-clean power. Exhaust flue gas from the coal/gas plant is supplied to the cathode side of the fuel cell, instead of ambient air. The CO2 in the exhaust is transferred to the anode side of the fuel cell, where it is much more concentrated and easy to separate. The CO2 from the anode exhaust stream is liquefied using common chilling equipment. The purified CO2 is then available for enhanced oil recovery, industrial applications or sequestration. Carbon concentration and capture within the carbonate fuel cell is a side reaction of the natural gas-fueled power generation process. 

14

Carbon capture systems can be implemented in increments, starting with as little as 5% capture with no appreciable change in the cost of power and with minimum capital outlay. Our solution generates a return on capital resulting from the fuel cell's production of electricity rather than an increase in operating expense required by other carbon capture technologies, and can extend the life of existing coal-fired power plants, enabling low carbon utilization of domestic coal and gas resources. During 2016, we announced the site selection for the first installation of a carbon capture configured DFC3000 power plant, which will be located at a mixed coal/gas fired power plant owned by a subsidiary of Southern Co. (NYSE: SO). The project is partially funded by the US Department of Energy and ExxonMobil is also participating in the project.
Energy Storage

• | Hydrogen production: Our DFC plants can be configured to produce both power and hydrogen from renewable fuels or natural gas. The hydrogen and power production can be traded off, producing less power and more hydrogen during periods of lower power demand. Hydrogen is an energy carrier that can be compressed and stored for long durations and either used on-site or transported for use elsewhere. 


• | Electrolysis: Our solid oxide fuel cell technology has electrolysis capabilities, which is the ability to operate ‘in reverse’ compared to fuel cell mode. Instead of producing power from fuel and air, a solid oxide stack in electrolysis mode splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using supplied electricity.. Many utilities are considering electrolysis as an approach to store or utilize excess power from intermittent renewable sources when grid demand is low, producing hydrogen that can be used for thermal purposes, vehicle fueling, or to then make power during peak demand periods. 


• | Reversible Solid Oxide Energy Storage: Our solid oxide stacks are capable of alternating between electrolysis and power generation mode. This allows us to configure efficient and cost effective energy storage solutions where hydrogen is produced from electricity in electrolysis mode and stored until power is needed, at which point the stored hydrogen is used in the same stacks to produce electricity. Long durations of storage capacity can be achieved just by providing sufficient hydrogen storage capability, making this solution uniquely qualified for storage applications requiring many hours or days of storage capacity. The need for long duration energy storage behind the meter and on the utility grid will increase as the penetration of intermittent renewable sources on the grid increases. This solution can be sited adjacent to an electric substation, avoiding the need for transmission. 

In summary, our solutions offer many advantages:

• | Distributed generation: Generating power near the point of use improves power reliability and energy security and lessens the need for costly and difficult-to-site generation and transmission infrastructure, enhancing the resiliency of the grid.


• | Ultra-clean: Our DFC power plants produce electricity electrochemically − without combustion − directly from readily available fuels such as natural gas and renewable biogas in a highly efficient process. The virtual absence of pollutants facilitates siting the power plants in regions with clean air permitting regulations and is an important public health benefit.


• | High efficiency: Fuel cells are the most efficient power generation option in their size class, providing the most power from a given unit of fuel, reducing fuel costs. This high electrical efficiency also reduces carbon emissions compared to less efficient combustion-based power generation.


• | Combined heat and power: Our power plants provide both electricity and usable high quality heat/steam from the same unit of fuel. The heat can be used for facility heating and cooling or further enhancing the electrical efficiency of the power plant in a combined cycle configuration. When used in CHP configurations, system efficiencies can reach up to 90%, depending on the application. 


• | Reliability / continuous operation: Our DFC power plants improve power reliability and energy security by lessening reliance on transmission and distribution infrastructure of the electric grid. Unlike solar and wind power, fuel cells are able to operate continuously regardless of weather or time of day.


• | Fuel flexibility: Our DFC power plants operate on a variety of existing and readily available fuels including natural gas, renewable biogas, directed biogas and propane.


• | Scalability: Our DFC power plants are scalable, providing a cost-effective solution to adding power incrementally as demand grows, such as multi-megawatt fuel cell parks supporting the electric grid.


• | Quiet operation: Because they produce power without combustion and contain very few moving parts, our DFC power plants operate quietly and without vibrations.


• | Easy to site: Our DFC power plants are relatively easy to site by virtue of their ultra-clean emissions profile, modest space requirements and quiet operation. These characteristics facilitate the installation of the power plants in urban locations with scarce and expensive land. A 10 MW fuel cell park only requires about one acre of land whereas an equivalent size solar array requires up to ten times as much land, illustrating how fuel cell parks are easy to site in high density areas with constrained land resources, and adjacent to the demand source thereby avoiding costly transmission construction. 


• | Dispatchability: We are offering a dispatchability option for utility-scale applications where some degree of power production cycling is valued on a pre-determined schedule to accommodate periods of lower power demand. Our power plants can also provide reactive power avoiding the need for separate static or dynamic VAR (volt-ampere reactive) compensation systems.

DFC Emissions Profile
Fuel cells are devices that directly convert chemical energy (fuel) into electricity, heat and water. Because fuel cells generate power electrochemically rather than by combusting (burning) fuels, they are more efficient in extracting energy from fuels, and produce less CO2 and only trace levels of pollutants compared to combustion-type power generation. The following table illustrates the favorable emission profile of our DFC and high efficiency power plants:

 | Emissions (Lbs. Per MWh)
 | NOX | SO2 | PM | CO2 | CO2 with CHP
Average U.S. Fossil Fuel Plant | 5.06 | 11.6 | 0.27 | 2,031 | NA 
Microturbine (60 kW) | 0.44 | 0.008 | 0.09 | 1,596 | 520 - 680 
Small Natural Gas Turbine | 1.15 | 0.008 | 0.08 | 1,494 | 520 - 680 
DFC® - natural gas | 0.01 | 0.0001 | 0.00002 | 940 | 520 - 680 
DFC 4000 High Efficiency Plant | 0.01 | 0.0001 | 0.00002 | 740 | 520 - 680 
DFC - utility scale carbon capture | 0.01 | 0.0001 | 0.00002 | 80 | n/a 
DFC - renewable biogas | 0.01 | 0.0001 | 0.00002 | < 0 | < 0 

For power plants operating on natural gas, higher fuel efficiency results in lower CO2, and also results in less fuel needed per kWh of electricity generated and Btu of heat produced. The high efficiency of our products results in significantly less CO2 per unit of power production compared to the average U.S. fossil fuel power plant, and the carbon emissions are reduced even further when configured for combined heat and power. When operating on renewable biogas, government agencies and regulatory bodies generally classify our power plants as carbon neutral due to the renewable nature of the fuel source.
High electrical efficiency reduces customers' exposure to volatile fuel costs, minimizes operating costs, and provides maximum electrical output from a finite fuel source. Our power plants achieve electrical efficiencies of 47% to 60% or higher depending on configuration, location, and application, and up to 90% total efficiency in a CHP configuration, depending on the application. The electric grid in the United States is only approximately 36% electrically efficient and typically does not support CHP configurations.
Manufacturing
We design and manufacture the core DFC fuel cell components that are stacked on top of each other to build a fuel cell stack. For MW size power plants, four fuel cell stacks are combined to build a fuel cell module. To complete the power plant, the fuel cell module or modules are combined with the balance of plant (BOP). The mechanical BOP processes the incoming fuel such as natural gas or renewable biogas and includes various fuel handling and processing equipment such as pipes and blowers. The electrical BOP processes the power generated for use by the customer and includes electrical interface equipment such as an inverter. The BOP components are either purchased directly from suppliers or the manufacturing is outsourced based on our designs and specifications. This strategy allows us to leverage our manufacturing capacity, focusing on the critical aspects of the power plant where we have specialized knowledge and expertise. BOP components are shipped directly to a customer's site and are then assembled with the fuel cell module into a complete power plant.
Cell Manufacturing and Capacity
Our strategy is to produce power for prices that are below typical grid prices. Higher purchasing volume reduces the per unit cost of raw materials and componentry. As explained below, the North American production facility has an annual capacity of 100 MW with an expansion underway, and the Asian manufacturing facility, owned and operated by our technology licensee, POSCO Energy, has 100 MW of annual capacity in a building that is sized for 200 MW annually. Our global cell manufacturing capabilities are described below:
North America: We operate a 65,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Torrington, Connecticut where we produce the DFC cell packages and assemble the fuel cell modules. The completed modules are then conditioned at our facility in Danbury, Connecticut for the final step in the manufacturing process and shipped to customer sites. Our overall DFC manufacturing process in North America (module manufacturing, final assembly, testing and conditioning) has a production capacity of 100 MW per year, with full utilization under its current configuration.
16

We are undertaking a multi-year project to reduce costs and position ourselves for future growth in two phases. The first phase is underway to add a 102,000 square foot addition to our North American manufacturing facility in Torrington, Connecticut. The building expansion will allow for consolidation of warehousing and service facilities enabling manufacturing efficiencies by providing the needed space to re-configure production. As demand supports, the second phase will be undertaken to add manufacturing equipment to increase annual capacity to at least 200 megawatts. The State of Connecticut is extending two low interest long term loans to us for each of the two phases and up to $10.0 million of tax credits. Each loan is $10.0 million, with an interest rate of 2.0% and a term of 15 years. Up to 50% of the principal is forgivable if certain job creation and retention targets are met. We have received the proceeds of the first $10 million loan to support the first phase of the expansion. 
The Torrington production facility, the Danbury corporate headquarters and research and development, and Field Service are ISO 9001:2008 certified, reinforcing the tenets of the FuelCell Energy Quality Management System and our core values of continual improvement and commitment to quality.
South Korea: To meet Asian demand, POSCO Energy built a cell manufacturing facility in Pohang, Korea and the facility became operational in late 2015. Annual production capability is 100 MW and the building is sized to accommodate up to 200 MW of annual production to support future growth in the Asian market.
Europe: We have a 20,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Taufkirchen, Germany that has the capability to perform final module assembly for up to 20 MW per year of sub-megawatt fuel cell power plants for the European market.
Raw Materials and Supplier Relationships
We use various commercially available raw materials and components to construct a fuel cell module, including nickel and stainless steel, which are key inputs to our manufacturing process. Our fuel cell stack raw materials are sourced from multiple vendors and are not considered precious metals. We have a global integrated supply chain that serves North American, European, and the POSCO owned Asian production facilities. In addition to manufacturing the fuel cell module in our Torrington facility, the electrical and mechanical BOP are assembled by and procured from several suppliers. All of our suppliers must undergo a qualification process. We continually evaluate and qualify new suppliers as we diversify our supplier base in our pursuit of lower costs and consistent quality. We purchase mechanical and electrical balance of plant componentry from third party vendors, based on our own proprietary designs.
Product Cost Reduction
Our overall cost reduction strategy is based on the assumption that continued increases in production will result in further economies of scale, reducing the per-unit cost of the raw materials and componentry we purchase. In addition, our cost reduction strategy relies on implementation of further advancements in our manufacturing process, global competitive sourcing integrated with POSCO sourcing volumes, engineering design and technology improvements (including modules with longer life and increased module power output). We have a broad range of initiatives to reduce costs and improve our overall project affordability.
Improvements in affordability, driven by product cost reductions, are critical for us to accelerate market adoption of our fuel cell products and attain company profitability. Cost reductions will also reduce or eliminate the need for incentive funding programs which currently allow us to price our products to compete with grid-delivered power and other distributed generation technologies.
We have reduced the product cost of our megawatt-class power plants by more than 60% from the first commercial installation in 2003 through engineering redesign, sourcing, and improved power output and module life. Higher purchasing volume reduces costs and strengthens the supply chain by enabling direct purchasing rather than through distributors and the ability to access stronger national and international suppliers rather than small local or regional fabricators. We manage a global integrated supply chain to ensure consistent pricing and leverage volume purchases whether by POSCO Energy or the Company, to ensure both parties benefit by obtaining lower pricing tiers from suppliers from the greater combined purchasing volume.
Engineering, Procurement and Construction
We provide customers with complete turn-key solutions including the development, engineering, procurement, construction, interconnection and operations for our fuel cell projects. From an EPC standpoint, FCE has an extensive history of safe and timely delivery of turnkey projects. We have developed relationships with many design firms and licensed general contractors and have a repeatable, safe, and efficient execution philosophy that has been successfully demonstrated multiple times in many different U.S. states and some European countries with an exemplary safety record. The ability to rapidly and safely execute installations minimizes high cost construction period financing and can assist customers in certain situations when the commercial operating date is time sensitive.
17

Services and Warranty Agreements
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services including engineering, project management and installation, and long-term operating and maintenance programs including trained technicians that remotely monitor and operate the plants around the world 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. We employ field technicians to service the power plants and maintain service centers near our customers to ensure high availability of our plants. Virtually all of our customers purchase service agreements ranging up to 20 years. Pricing for service contracts is based upon the markets in which we compete and includes all future maintenance and fuel cell module exchanges. While the electrical and mechanical BOP in our DFC power plants is designed to last about 25 years, the current fuel cell modules must be replaced approximately every five years.
Under the typical provisions of the service agreements, we provide services to monitor, operate and maintain customer power plants to meet specified performance levels. Operations and maintenance is a key driver for power plants to deliver their projected revenue and cash flows. Many of our service agreements include guarantees for system performance, including electrical output and heat rate. Should the power plant not meet the minimum performance levels, we may be required to replace the fuel cell module with a new or used replacement and/or pay performance penalties. The service aspects of our business model provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for the Company. We have committed future production for scheduled fuel cell module exchanges under service agreements through the year 2037. The pricing structure of the service agreements incorporates these scheduled fuel cell module exchanges and the committed nature of this production facilitates our production planning. Our goal is to optimize our customers’ power plants to meet expected operating parameters throughout their contracted project term.
In addition to our service agreements, we provide a warranty for our products for a specific period of time against manufacturing or performance defects. The warranty term in the U.S. is typically 15 months after shipment or 12 months after acceptance of our products, except for fuel cell kits. We warranty fuel cell kits and components for 21 months from the date of shipment due to the additional shipping and customer manufacture time required. We accrue for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience. 
License Agreements and Royalty Income
We receive license fees and royalty income from POSCO Energy related to manufacturing and technology transfer agreements entered into in 2007, 2009 and 2012. The Cell Technology Transfer Agreement ("CTTA"), executed in October 2012, provides POSCO Energy with the technology to manufacture DFC power plants in South Korea and the market access to sell power plants throughout Asia. In October 2012, the Company and POSCO Energy extended the terms of the 2007 and 2009 license agreements to be consistent with the term of the CTTA which expires on October 31, 2027. The term of these agreements may be extended beyond 2027 through future extensions, each for a period of five (5) years, by mutual agreement of the Company and POSCO Energy. In conjunction with the CTTA, the Company receives a 3.0% royalty on POSCO Energy net product sales as well as a royalty on each scheduled fuel cell module replacement under service agreements for modules that were built by POSCO Energy and installed at any plant in Asia under terms of the Master Service Agreement between the Company and POSCO Energy.
As we expand into other vertical or geographic markets, we may pursue additional licensing and royalty opportunities.
Advanced Technology Programs (Third Party Funded Research and Development)
We undertake both public and privately-funded research and development to expand the markets for our DFC power plants, reduce costs, and expand our technology portfolio in complementary high-temperature fuel cell systems. This research builds on our expertise and the versatility of our fuel cell power plants and contributes to the development of potentially new end markets. Our power plants provide various value streams including clean electricity, high quality usable heat, hydrogen suitable for vehicle fueling or industrial purposes as well as use of DFC power plants to concentrate CO2 from coal and natural gas fired power plants. Our Advanced Technology Programs are focused on three strategic areas for commercialization within a reasonable timeframe: (1) distributed hydrogen production, compression, and recovery, (2) carbon capture for emissions reduction and power generation and (3) SOFC, SOEC, and RSOFC for stationary power generation and energy storage. The revenue and associated costs from government and third party sponsored research and development is classified as “Advanced technologies contract revenues” and “Cost of advanced technologies contract revenues”, respectively, in our consolidated financial statements.
We have worked on technology development with various U.S. government departments and agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Office of Naval Research (ONR), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Government funding, principally from the DOE, provided 8%, 6% and 6% of our revenue for each of the fiscal years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
18

Significant commercialization programs on which we are currently working include:
Carbon Capture - Coal and natural gas are abundant, low cost resources that are widely used to generate electricity in developed and developing countries, but burning these fuels results in the emission of criteria pollutants and CO2. Cost effective and efficient carbon capture from coal-fired and gas-fired power plants potentially represents a large global market because it could enable clean use of these fuels. Our carbonate fuel cell technology separates and concentrates CO2 as a side reaction during the power generation process. DFC carbon capture research conducted by us has demonstrated that this is a viable technology for the efficient separation of CO2 from coal or natural gas power plant exhaust streams. Capturing CO2 as a side reaction while generating additional valuable power is an approach that could be more cost effective than other systems which are being considered for carbon capture. 
We announced an agreement with ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) in 2016 to pursue fuel cell carbon capture for central generation gas-fired power plants. We are working on the installation of a megawatt-class fuel cell power plant at a mixed coal/gas-fired power plant in Alabama that is owned by Alabama Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, a large southeastern US utility. This project is being supported by an award from the US Department of Energy to design and build the first MW-scale carbon capture system for coal fired power, and by ExxonMobil through a joint development agreement for evaluating carbon capture from gas-fired power generation. Successful demonstration may then lead to additional fuel cell power plant installations at this site and/or other central generation coal or gas-fired sites globally. In addition, in 2016 we announced two engineering studies: one with Alberta Innovates, a consortium of Canadian oil sands producers, and one with Cenovus Energy, as lead partner of a Joint Industry Project, to evaluate the feasibility of fuel cell carbon capture for gas-fired boilers used in oil sands processing. These various oil & gas and power producers are interested in the fuel cell carbon capture value proposition, and these studies are evaluating the application of our carbon capture system at specific sites, which could be future MW-scale carbon capture project opportunities. 
Distributed Hydrogen production, compression, and recovery - On-site or distributed hydrogen generation represents an attractive market for the DFC technology. Our high temperature DFC power plant generates electricity directly from a fuel by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to supply hydrogen for the electrical generation process. Gas separation technology can be added to capture hydrogen that is not used by the electrical generation process, and we term this configuration DFC-H2. This value-added proposition may be compelling for industrial users of hydrogen and transportation applications, further summarized as follows: 
Industrial Applications: We operate a tri-generation DFC300-H2 power plant at our Torrington manufacturing facility, utilizing natural gas to supply (1) electricity for the facility, (2) heat for the building, and (3) hydrogen for the manufacturing process, replacing hydrogen that was delivered by diesel truck. The installation is a showcase for industrial users of hydrogen to visit. The project is supported by the DOE and the State of Connecticut.
Vehicle Fueling Applications: A tri-generation DFC300-H2 power plant completed a three year demonstration at the Orange County Wastewater Treatment Facility in Irvine, California, utilizing renewable biogas to supply hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicle fueling and clean renewable electricity. The demonstration was performed under sub-contract to Air Products (NYSE: APD) with funding provided by the DOE, California Air Resources Board, South Coast Air Quality Management District, the Orange County Sanitation District, and Southern California Gas Company.
SOFC/SOEC/RSOFC development and commercialization: We are working towards commercialization of solid oxide fuel cell technology to target sub-megawatt commercial applications including smaller wastewater treatment facilities that do not have enough gas production to support a multi-megawatt solution as well as storage applications utilizing hydrogen as an energy carrier and storage medium. The potential market opportunity for sub-megawatt applications is for customers that need on-site power generation in either combined heat and power or electric-only configurations. SOFC technology is complementary to our carbonate technology-based MW scale DFC product line and affords us the opportunity to leverage our field operating history, existing expertise in power plant design, fuel processing and high volume manufacturing capabilities, and our existing installation and service infrastructure.
We perform SOFC/SOEC/RSOFC research and development at our Danbury facility as well as at our dedicated SOFC facility in Calgary, Canada. We are working under a variety of awards from DOE for development and commercialization of both SOFC and SOEC. 
We see significant market opportunities for distributed hydrogen production, carbon capture, solid oxide fuel cell solutions and energy storage. The demonstration projects described above are steps on the commercialization road map as we prudently leverage third-party resources and funding to accelerate the commercialization and realize the market potential for each of these solutions.

Research and Development (Company Funded Research and Development)
In addition to research and development performed under research contracts, we also fund our own research and development projects including extending module life, increasing the power output of our modules and reducing the cost of our products. Initiatives include increasing the net power output of the fuel cell stacks to 375 kW from 350 kW currently, and extending the stack life to seven years from five years currently. Greater power output and improved longevity will lead to improved gross margin profitability on a per-unit basis for each power plant sold and improved profitability of service contracts, which will support expanding gross margins for the Company.
In addition to output and life enhancements, we designed and are now introducing the 3.7 megawatt DFC4000 configuration with increased electrical efficiency, and we invest in cost reduction and improving the performance, quality and serviceability of our plants. These efforts continually improve our value proposition and affordability.
Company-funded research and development is included in Research and development expenses (operating expenses) in our consolidated financial statements. The total research and development expenditures in the consolidated statement of operations, including third party and Company-funded, are as follows:

 | Years Ended October 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Cost of advanced technologies contract revenues | $ | 11,879 | | | $ | 13,470 | | $ | 16,664
Research and development expenses | 20,846 | | | 17,442 | | | 18,240
Total research and development | $ | 32,725 | | | $ | 30,912 | | $ | 34,904

Backlog
The Company has a contract backlog totaling approximately $432.3 million at October 31, 2016 compared to $381.4 million at October 31, 2015. At October 31, 2016 and 2015, the backlog includes approximately $347.3 million and $254.1 million, respectively, of service and power purchase agreements. Service backlog at October 31, 2016 has an average term of approximately 15 years weighted based on dollar backlog and utility service contracts up to twenty years in duration. At October 31, 2016, product sales backlog totaled approximately $24.9 million compared to $90.7 million at October 31, 2015. At October 31, 2016, Advanced technologies contracts backlog totaled $60.1 million, of which $39.6 million is funded compared to $36.5 million at October 31, 2015, of which $33.4 million was funded. 
Our backlog amount outstanding is not indicative of amounts to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year.  The specific elements of backlog may vary in terms of timing and revenue recognition from less than one year to up to twenty years. In addition, the Company may retain operating power plants on the balance sheet rather than selling them, thus creating variability in timing of revenue recognition. Accordingly, the timing and the nature of our business makes it difficult to predict what portion of our backlog will be filled in the next fiscal year although we are currently estimating revenues of at least $75 million both from backlog and new contracts for our fiscal year 2017. In all events, we expect the majority of our backlog will remain unfilled in fiscal year 2017 given the nature of our business. 
Competition
The electric generation market is competitive with continually evolving participants. Our DFC power plants compete in the marketplace for stationary distributed generation. In addition to different types of stationary fuel cells, some other technologies that compete in this marketplace include micro-turbines and reciprocating gas engines.
Fuel cell technologies are classified according to the electrolyte used by each fuel cell type. Our DFC technology utilizes a carbonate electrolyte. Carbonate-based fuel cells offer a number of advantages over other types of fuel cells designed for megawatt-class commercial applications. These advantages include carbonate fuel cells' ability to generate electricity directly from readily available fuels such as natural gas or renewable biogas, lower raw material costs as the high temperature of the fuel cell enables the use of commodity metals rather than precious metals, and high-quality heat suitable for CHP applications. We are also actively developing SOFC technology, as discussed in the prior Advanced Technology section. Other fuel cell types that may be used for commercial applications include phosphoric acid and PEM.
20

The following table illustrates industry estimates of the electrical efficiency, expected capacity range and byproduct heat use of the four principal types of fuel cells as well as highlights of typical market applications:

 | MW- Class | Sub-MW- Class | | Micro CHP | | Mobile
Technology | Carbonate (CFC) | Phosphoric Acid (PAFC) | Solid Oxide (SOFC) | | PEM / SOFC | | Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM)
Plant size | 1.4 MW - 3.7 MW | 400 kW | up to 200 kW | | < 10 kW | | 5 - 100 kW 
Typical Application | Utilities, universities, industrial, municipal | Commercial buildings, grocery stores | Commercial buildings | | Residential and small commercial | | Transportation 
Fuel | Natural gas, On-site biogas, Directed biogas, others | Natural gas, Directed biogas | Natural gas, Directed biogas | | Natural gas | | Hydrogen 
Advantages | Efficiency, lowest cost, fuel flexible & CHP | CHP | Efficiency | | Load following & CHP | | Load following 
Electrical efficiency | 43%-47% std. configuration; ~60% for specialized configurations | 40% - 42% | 50% - 60% | | 25% - 35% | | 25% - 35% 
Combined Heat & Power (CHP) | Steam, hot water, chilling & hybrid electrical applications | Hot water | Depends on technology used | | Suitable for facility heating | | n/a 

Several companies in the U.S. are engaged in fuel cell development, although we believe we are the only domestic company engaged in significant manufacturing and commercialization of stationary CFCs. Emerging fuel cell technologies (and the companies developing them) include stationary PEM fuel cells for pure hydrogen applications (Ballard Power Systems), small or portable PEM fuel cells (Ballard Power Systems, Plug Power, Intelligent Energy Holdings, and increasing activity by numerous automotive companies including Toyota, Hyundai, Honda and GM), stationary phosphoric acid fuel cells (Doosan), stationary solid oxide fuel cells (LG/Rolls Royce partnership, General Electric, Bloom Energy and Ceres Power Holdings), and small residential solid oxide fuel cells (Parker Hannifin, Toyota/Kyocera and Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd.). Each of these competitors with stationary fuel cell applications has the potential to capture market share in our target markets.
There are other potential fuel cell competitors internationally. In Japan, Fuji Electric has been involved with both PEM and phosphoric acid fuel cells and Panasonic is involved with PEM fuel cells for micro-CHP applications. In the United Kingdom, AFC Energy is engaged in alkaline fuel cell development for commercial applications.
Other than fuel cell developers, we also compete with companies such as Caterpillar, Cummins, Wartsilla, MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH (MTU), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Detroit Diesel, which manufacture more mature combustion-based distributed power generation equipment, including various engines and turbines, and have well-established manufacturing and distribution operations along with product operating and cost features. Competition on larger MW projects may also come from gas turbine companies like General Electric, Caterpillar Solar Turbines and Kawasaki.
We also compete against the electric grid, which is readily available to prospective customers. The electric grid is supplied by traditional centralized power plants including coal, gas and nuclear, with transmission lines used to transport the electricity to the point of use.
Our stationary fuel cell power plants can complement solar and wind intermittency with the continuous power output of the fuel cells. Solar and wind require specific geographies and weather profiles and require transmission for utility-scale applications as well as a significant amount of land compared to our fuel cell power plants, making them difficult to site in urban areas, unlike our solutions.
We believe that only carbonate fuel cells are suitable for fuel cell carbon capture applications, so our fuel cell carbon capture solution does not compete against fuel cells from manufacturers utilizing other fuel cell technologies.
Our distributed hydrogen solution competes against traditional centralized hydrogen generation as well as electrolyzers used for distributed applications. Hydrogen is typically generated at a central location in large quantities by combustion-based steam reforming and then distributed to end users by diesel truck. Besides utilizing tri-generation DFC plants for distributed hydrogen, electrolyzers can be used that are in essence, reverse fuel cells. Electrolyzers take electricity and convert it to hydrogen. The hydrogen can be used as it is generated, compressed and stored, or injected into the natural gas pipeline. Companies using fuel cell-based electrolyzer technology for transportation applications include Proton Onsite, H2 Logic and Hydrogenics Corporation. 
21

Hydrogen is an energy carrier and energy storage utilizing hydrogen is a growing market opportunity that we are pursuing with our SOFC/SOEC technology. Companies using PEM-based fuel cell electrolyzer technology for storage include Hydrogenics Corporation, ITM Power PLC, and McPhy Energy.
Regulatory and Legislative Support
Regulatory and legislative support encompasses policy, incentive programs, and defined sustainability initiatives such as Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS).
Distributed generation solves different problems than central generation and regulatory policy can impact deployment of distributed generation. States and municipalities in the U.S. have adopted programs for which our products qualify. For example, there are strong programs in California supporting self-generation, clean air power generation and carbon reduction. Additional states have programs supporting on-site power production, combined heat and power applications, carbon reduction, grid resiliency / micro-grids and utility ownership of fuel cell projects.
Sometimes policy may be dated and inadvertently slows adoption of distributed generation. When this occurs, industry may work with regulatory and legislative bodies to revise and update policy. An example of this from 2016 was the State of California approval of a five megawatt departing load charge exemption cap for fuel cells, which improves project economics due to the operating characteristics of the continual power generation profile of fuel cells. This represented an increase from what was previously a one megawatt cap for utility departing load charges. 
The U.S. Federal Government extends an investment tax credit (ITC) that allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures (up to a tax credit limit of $3,000/kW) for eligible power generation technologies. In December, 2015, the United States Congress extended the ITC for 5 years, beginning January 1, 2017. The intention, as publicly stated by Congressional leaders, was to extend the ITC to all eligible technologies; however, the actual approved language only extended the ITC for solar energy technologies. As of January 1, 2017, fuel cells and a number of other power generation technologies are no longer eligible for the ITC. 
Based on numerous public comments by leaders and members of Congress in the media and in the Congressional Record that the omission was an oversight that should be corrected, the fuel cell industry is continuing outreach to ensure parity of domestically designed and manufactured fuel cells with solar technologies. American designed and manufactured fuel cells provide value to the U.S. economy and stakeholders in numerous ways that justify their inclusion in the ITC, including:

• | Fuel cells utilize domestic sources of natural gas to create electricity cleaner and more efficiently than traditional resources and improve power reliability by siting continual power where it is used.


• | The ITC is currently only supporting solar panels that are generally designed and manufactured overseas while U.S. designed and manufactured fuel cells with their strong domestic supply chain and export opportunities are excluded.


• | Fuel cell carbon capture can help stabilize the U.S. coal industry and drive demand for U.S. natural gas by affordably reducing CO2 emissions from coal and gas fired power plants and industrial facilities. Additionally, there is a global export market potential for this American manufactured innovation. 

While the ITC is a driver of fuel cell projects in the US, the ITC is not relevant for our European presence or for sales in Asia.  Additionally, as discussed elsewhere in this 10-K, we anticipate retaining ownership over more fuel cell projects, which we believe will make us less dependent on support from the ITC.  Further, we believe that our products will achieve efficiencies that will permit them to compete without ITC support.  For example, we are launching the DFC4000, which enhances fuel cell project economies for utility and data center applications by increasing the electrical efficiency.  This product was designed to address decreasing incentives over time at both the federal and state level. 
The majority of states in the U.S. have enacted legislation adopting Clean Energy Standards (“CES”) or Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”) mechanisms. Under these standards, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible resources, by a specified date. CES and RPS legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s mandate, the definition of eligible clean and renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for CES or RPS compliance. Fuel cells using biogas qualify as renewable power generation technology in all of the CES and RPS states in the U.S., and eight states (including Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Maine) specify that fuel cells operating on natural gas are also eligible for these initiatives in recognition of the high efficiency and near-zero pollutants of fuel cells.
22

Internationally, South Korea has an RPS to promote clean energy, reduce carbon emissions, and develop local manufacturing  of clean energy generation products to accelerate economic growth. The RPS is designed to increase new and renewable power generation to ten percent of total power generation by 2023 from two percent in 2012 by requiring an additional one half of one percent of new  and renewable power added annually from 2012 to 2017, increasing to one percent per annum through 2023. This equates to an estimated 370 MW market annually from 2016 to 2023. Electric utilities and independent power producers  that have in excess of 500 MW of power generation capacity are required to comply with the RPS.
In Europe, there are a number of renewable energy programs and several environmental initiatives that contribute to growth in our markets.  In addition, there are a variety of research and development funding programs for fuel cells and hydrogen at the European Union level as well as state level within specific countries. Hydrogen Europe, an industrial association with more than 100 members, is supporting the expansion of the hydrogen and fuel cell industry by focusing on market deployment and financing models. In Italy, there are financial incentives for CHP configurations with high efficiency, including our products whether operating on natural gas or renewable biogas.  Germany uses the National Innovation Program for Fuel Cells and Hydrogen led by National Organization for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology as the tool to differentiate and support fuel cells versus combustion-based technology. There is also a technology deployment program in Germany for stationary fuel cells operating on either natural gas or renewable biogas. 
Government Regulation
Our Company and its products are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Negligible emissions of SOx and NOx from our power plants are substantially lower than conventional combustion-based generating stations, and are far below existing and proposed regulatory limits. The primary emissions from our power plants, assuming no cogeneration application, are humid flue gas that is discharged at temperatures of 700-800°F, water that is discharged at temperatures of 10-20°F above ambient air temperatures, and CO2 in per kW hour amounts that are much less than conventional fossil fuel central generation power plants due to the high efficiency of fuel cells. Due to the high temperature of the flue gas emissions, we are required to site or configure our power plants in a manner that allows the flue gas to be vented at acceptable and safe distances. The discharge of water from our power plants requires permits that depend on whether the water is to be discharged into a storm drain or into the local wastewater system.
We are also subject to federal, state, provincial and/or local regulation with respect to, among other things, emissions and siting. In addition, utility companies and several states in the USA have created and adopted, or are in the process of creating, interconnection regulations covering both technical and financial requirements for interconnection of fuel cell power plants to utility grids. Our power plants are designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in their international markets.
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our employees and we are dedicated to seeing that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices, training and procedures. All of our employees must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations, consistent with these work practices, training and procedures, and consistent with all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  
Proprietary Rights and Licensed Technology
Our intellectual property consists of patents, trade secrets and institutional knowledge that we feel is a competitive advantage and represents a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors. Our Company was founded in 1969 as an applied research company and began focusing on carbonate fuel cells in the 1980s with our first fully commercialized DFC power plant sold in 2003. Over this period of time, we have gained extensive experience in designing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining fuel cell power plants. This experience cannot be easily or quickly replicated and combined with our trade secrets, proprietary processes and patents, safeguards our intellectual property rights.
At October 31, 2016, the Company, excluding its subsidiaries, has 90 patents in the U.S. and 88 patents in other jurisdictions covering our fuel cell technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with patents directed to various aspects of our Direct FuelCell technology, SOFC technology, PEM fuel cell technology, and applications thereof. We also have 40 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 62 pending in other jurisdictions.  Our U.S. patents will expire between 2016 and 2034, and the current average remaining life of our U.S. patents is approximately 9.9 years.  
Our subsidiary, Versa Power Systems, Inc., has 33 current U.S. patents and 70 international patents covering the SOFC technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with an average remaining U.S. patent life of approximately 
23

7.3 years.  Versa Power Systems, Inc. also has 3 pending U.S. patent applications and 16 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions.  In addition, our subsidiary FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH has license rights to use FuelCell Energy's carbonate fuel cell technology as well as 2 U.S. and 27 patents outside the U.S. for carbonate fuel cell technology licensed from Fraunhofer IKTS.
No patents have expired that would have any material impact on our current or anticipated operations. As has historically been the case, we are continually innovating, and have a significant number of invention disclosures that we are reviewing that may result in additional patent applications.
Many of our U.S. patents are the result of government-funded research and development programs, including our Department of Energy (DOE) programs. U.S. patents we own that resulted from government-funded research are subject to the government exercising “march-in” rights. We believe that the likelihood of the U.S. government exercising these rights is remote and would only occur if we ceased our commercialization efforts and there was a compelling national need to use the patents.
Significant Customers and Information about Geographic Areas 
We contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of our products and for research and development contracts. For the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our top customers, POSCO Energy (which is a related party and owns approximately 7% of the outstanding common shares of the Company), the Department of Energy, the United Illuminating Company, Dominion Bridgeport Fuel Cell, LLC, and BioFuels Energy, LLC accounted for an aggregate of 78%, 89% and 85%, respectively, of our total annual consolidated revenue. Revenue percentage by major customer for the last three fiscal years is as follows: 

 | Years Ended October 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
POSCO Energy | 48 | % | | 67 | % | 69 | %
The United Illuminating Company | 10 | % | | 14 | % | 9 | %
Department of Energy | 8 | % | | 5 | % | 4 | %
Dominion Bridgeport Fuel Cell, LLC | 6 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %
BioFuels Energy, LLC | 6 | % | | — | % | — | %
Total | 78 | % | | 89 | % | 85 | %

See Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding our revenue and revenue recognition policies.
We have marketing and manufacturing operations both within and outside the United States. We source raw materials and balance of plant components from a diverse global supply chain. In 2016, the foreign country with the greatest concentration risk was South Korea, accounting for 48% of our consolidated net sales. A multi-year fuel cell component order from our South Korean partner, POSCO Energy, concluded at the end of 2016. The Company receives royalties from POSCO Energy on the sale and module replacements related to service of fuel cell power plants in Asia, so accordingly, the concentration of sales to POSCO Energy may be lower in future years compared to 2016. As part of our Strategic Plan, we are in the process of diversifying our sales mix from both a customer specific and geographic perspective. See Item 1A: “Risk Factors - We are substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations" and "Risk Factors - We depend on relationships with strategic partners, and the terms and enforceability of many of these relationships are not certain" and "Risk Factors - We have licensed certain technology and market access to POSCO Energy which limits our ability to independently access the Asian market."
The international nature of our operations subjects us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements and tariffs, taxes, and other trade restrictions. See Item 1A: “Risk Factors - We are subject to risks inherent in international operations.” See also Note 13 “Segment and Geographical Information,” to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Consolidated Financial Statements And Supplementary Data” of the Form 10-K Report for information about our net sales by geographic region for the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. See also Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for other information about our operations and activities in various geographic regions.

Sustainability
CODE
FuelCell Energy’s ultra-clean, efficient and reliable fuel cell power plants help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These highly efficient and environmentally friendly products support the “Triple Bottom Line” concept of sustainability, consisting of environmental, social and economic considerations.
Product efficiency
The electrical efficiency of our fuel cell solutions ranges from approximately 47 percent to 60 percent depending on the configuration. This compares favorably to the average U.S. electrical grid of about 33 percent. Our solutions deliver this high electrical efficiency where the power is used, avoiding transmission. Transmission line losses average about six percent to nine percent for the U.S. grid, which is a hidden cost to ratepayers. In a combined heat and power configuration, total thermal efficiency of our fuel cell solutions can be up to 90 percent depending on the application. 
Energy management
We utilize our fuel cells to provide a portion of the electricity used at our corporate office and at our North American manufacturing facility. We have installed a tri-generation fuel cell at our manufacturing facility that meets a portion of the power and heating needs, as well as generating high purity hydrogen used in the fuel cell manufacturing process. Generating multiple value streams on-site from the same unit of fuel avoids electrical transmission line losses, avoids the fuel cost and emissions of a combustion-based boiler typically used for heating, and cleanly generating hydrogen on-site avoids the carbon emissions and criteria pollutants emitted by standard hydrogen production at a distant location and transported via diesel truck. 
Other examples of energy management include routing excess heat from production processes throughout the manufacturing facility to reduce both heating costs and associated emissions, utilizing the power produced by fuel cells undergoing R&D at our corporate office for a portion of the power needs of the facility, and installation of high efficiency lighting at our North American manufacturing facility and corporate office. We recognize that there is more to be done and utilize cross-functional teams to identify and evaluate additional areas for improvement.
While we continue to enhance and adopt sustainable business practices, we recognize this is an ongoing effort with more to be accomplished; such as further reducing the direct and indirect aspects of our carbon footprint. Our manufacturing process has a very low carbon footprint, utilizing an assembly oriented production strategy. 
Product end-of-life management
We value sustainability just as seriously as our customers. We continue to incorporate sustainability best practices into our corporate culture and into the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our fuel cell power plants. For example, at the end-of-life of our power plants, we refurbish and re-use certain parts of the power plant and we are able to recycle most of what we cannot re-use, supporting the sustainability concept of ‘cradle-to-grave’. Some of the parts in the fuel cell module can be re-furbished, such as end plates, while the individual fuel cell components are sent to a smelter for recycling. The balance of plant has an operating life of twenty to twenty-five years, at which time metals such as steel and copper are reclaimed for scrap value. By weight, approximately 93% of the entire power plant can either be re-used or recycled.
We have a designated Sustainability Officer who promotes sustainable business practices in our manufacturing and administrative functions. For example, on the production floor, we reuse scrap from the manufacturing process, minimizing production waste. We are working to measure our carbon footprint in relation to production levels and actively working to reduce this carbon footprint. 
Workforce Health & Safety
We work to continually improve what we feel is a robust safety program. This is demonstrated by an improving safety trend over each of the past 3 years. We have never had a workplace fatality at any of our facilities or power plant installations.
Sustainability also incorporates social risks and human rights and we will not knowingly support or do business with suppliers that treat workers improperly or unlawfully, including, without limitation, those that engage in human trafficking, child labor, slavery or other unlawful or morally reprehensible employment practices. We are continuing to implement comprehensive monitoring of our global supply chain to eliminate social risks and ensure respect for human rights. We contractually ensure that all qualified suppliers in our supply chain comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, as amended. Our employees with supply chain responsibilities are trained on sustainability, social risks and human rights, and utilize this knowledge to evaluate existing suppliers and new potential suppliers on social and sustainability metrics to ensure compliance with our requirements and congruence with our company values.
25

Materials sourcing
Assuring the absence of conflict minerals in our power plants is a continuing initiative. Our fuel cells, including the fuel cell components and completed fuel cell module, do not utilize any 3TG minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) that are classified as conflict minerals. We do utilize componentry in the balance of plant such as computer circuit boards that utilize trace amounts of 3TG minerals. For perspective, total shipments in fiscal year 2015 weighed approximately 7.1 million pounds of which less than 2 pounds, or 0.000024%, represented 3TG minerals, so the presence of these minerals is minimal. Our conflict mineral disclosure filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form SD contains specifics on the actions we are taking to avoid the use of conflict minerals. 
Associates
At October 31, 2016, we had 580 full-time associates, of whom 246 were located at the Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing plant, 292 were located at the Danbury, Connecticut facility or various field offices, and 42 were located at our foreign locations. In addition, at October 31, 2016, the Company had 19 temporary workers. None of our associates is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our associates are good.
On December 1, 2016, we announced a decrease in the production level and a reduction in force that impacted 96 associates or approximately 17 percent of the global workforce.
