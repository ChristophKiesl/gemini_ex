Item 1.          Business
Overview
 
Superior Uniform Group, Inc. was organized in 1920 and was incorporated in 1922 as a New York company under the name Superior Surgical Mfg. Co., Inc. In 1998, the Company changed its name to Superior Uniform Group, Inc. (“Superior”) and its state of incorporation to Florida. 

On July 1, 2013, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of HPI Direct, Inc. (“HPI”), a company specializing in the design, manufacture and distribution of uniforms to major domestic retailers, foodservice chains, transportation and other service industries throughout the United States. The purchase price for the asset acquisition consisted of approximately $32,483,000 in cash, and inclusive of the real estate purchase described below, the issuance of approximately 418,000 restricted shares of Superior’s common stock, the potential future payment of up to $7,200,000 in additional contingent consideration through 2017, and the assumption of certain liabilities of HPI. The transaction also included the acquisition of the corporate offices and warehouse distribution facility from an entity related to HPI. 
  
On March 8, 2016, the Company closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of BAMKO, Inc. (“BAMKO”). The transaction had an effective date of March 1, 2016. BAMKO is a full-service merchandise sourcing and promotional products company based in Los Angeles, CA. With sales offices in the United States, England and Brazil, as well as support offices in China, Hong Kong, and India, BAMKO serves many of the world’s most successful brands. The purchase price for the asset acquisition consisted of approximately $15,161,000 in cash, net of cash acquired, the issuance of approximately 324,000 restricted shares of Superior’s common stock that will vest over a five year period, the potential future payment of approximately $5,500,000 in additional contingent consideration through 2021, and the assumption of certain liabilities of BAMKO. The transaction also included the acquisition of BAMKO’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong, China, Brazil and England as well as an affiliate in India.
 
Following a recent evaluation, Superior has realigned its organizational structure and updated its reportable operating segments as a result of changes in its business primarily related to the acquisition of BAMKO effective March 1, 2016. A new Promotional Products segment has been created and consists of sales to customers of promotional products. Superior is now comprised of three reportable business segments: (1) Uniforms and Related Products, (2) Remote Staffing Solutions, and (3) Promotional Products. Superior’s Uniforms and Related Products segment, through its signature marketing brands Fashion Seal Healthcare®, HPI Direct®, Superior I.D.™, Worklon®, and UniVogue®, manufactures and sells a wide range of uniforms, corporate identity apparel, career apparel and accessories for the hospital and healthcare fields; hotels; fast food and other restaurants; transportation; and the private security, industrial and commercial markets. In excess of 95% of Superior’s Uniforms and Related Products segment’s net sales are from the sale of uniforms and service apparel and directly-related products. Because the addition of the Promotional Products segment did not affect the composition of Superior’s other two segments, the Company did not restate segment information for prior periods.
 
Superior services its Remote Staffing Solutions segment through multiple The Office Gurus entities, including its direct and indirect subsidiaries in El Salvador, Belize, and the United States, (collectively, “TOG”). TOG is a near-shore premium provider of cost effective multilingual telemarketing and total office support solutions. 
 
The Promotional Products segment services customers that purchase primarily promotional and related products. The segment currently has sales offices in the United States, England and Brazil with support services in China, Hong Kong and India.
 
Products
 
Superior manufactures and sells a wide range of uniforms, corporate identity apparel, career apparel and accessories for the medical and health fields as well as for the industrial, commercial, leisure, and public safety markets in its Uniforms and Related Products segment. The Promotional Products segment produces and sells products for a wide variety of industries primarily to support marketing efforts.

Uniforms and related products are typically distributed through distribution centers in the United States. Promotional products are typically shipped directly from our vendors to our customers.
 
We do not consider sales in any of our segments to be highly seasonal.
 
For a depiction of revenues from external customers, income before taxes on income and total assets by segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, please refer to “Note 17. Operating Segment Information:” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, uniforms and service apparel and related products accounted for approximately 83%, 94% and 96% of net sales; promotional and related products accounted for approximately 11% of net sales in 2016 and no other single class of product listed above accounted for more than 10% of net sales.
 
Services
 
Through the recruitment and employment of highly qualified English-speaking agents, we provide our customers with extended office support from a versatile call and contact center environment in our Remote Staffing Solutions segment.
Competition
 
Superior competes in its Uniforms and Related Products segment with more than three dozen firms, including divisions of larger corporations. Superior competes with national and regional manufacturers, such as Cintas Corporation, Unifirst Corporation, G&K Services and ARAMARK—a division of ARAMARK Corporation. Superior also competes with local firms in most major metropolitan areas. The nature and degree of competition varies with the customer and the market. Industry statistics are not available, but we believe Superior is one of the leading suppliers of garments to hospitals, industrial clean rooms, hotels, motels, and food service establishments, and uniforms to linen suppliers. Superior experiences competition primarily based on breadth of products offered, styling and pricing. We believe that the strength of our brands and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products, allow us to compete effectively.
 
The market in which TOG operates has evolved into a global multi-billion dollar marketplace that is highly competitive and fragmented.  TOG’s competitors in the Remote Staffing Solutions segment range in size from very small firms offering specialized services or short-term project completion to very large independent firms, and include the in-house operations of many customers and potential customers. We compete directly and indirectly with various companies that provide contact center and other business process outsourcing solutions on an outsourced basis. These companies include, but are certainly not limited to, global providers such as APAC Customer Services, Convergys, Sitel, Atento, Sykes, Harte Hanks, and Teleperformance.   TOG also competes with local entities in other offshore geographies.  The list of potential competitors includes both publicly traded and privately held companies.

The promotional products industry is highly fragmented. We compete with a multitude of foreign, regional, and local competitors that vary by market. Major competitors in the Promotional Products segment include Staples, Inc. and BDA, Inc. We believe our creative services, product development, proprietary web platforms and our extensive global sourcing network along with our success with major brands will enable us to continue to be competitive and grow in this market.
 

Customers
 
The Uniform and Related Products segment has a substantial number of customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 9.2% of that segment’s 2016 net sales. The Remote Staffing Solutions segment’s largest customer represented 13.4% of that segment’s 2016 external revenues, and the largest customer in the Promotional Products segment represented 8.5% of that segment’s net sales in 2016.
Backlog
 
The Uniform and Related Products segment normally completes shipments of orders from stock within one week after the receipt of the order. As of February 20, 2017, the backlog of all orders that we believe to be firm for our Uniform and Realted Products segment was approximately $6,614,000, compared to approximately $9,300,000 as of February 22, 2016. The Promotional Products segment typically produces custom products based upon confirmed orders. The average length of time to produce orders is four to six months. The backlog of all orders for our Promotional Products segment was approximately $12,800,000 as of February 20, 2017.
Raw Materials, Working Capital and Inventory
 
The principal fabrics used in our Uniforms and Related Products segment are made from cotton, polyester, wool, silk, synthetic and cotton-synthetic blends. The majority of such fabrics are sourced in the Far East. The raw materials used in the fabrics we source from our suppliers are primarily cotton, polyester yarn, dyestuffs and chemical components of synthetic fabrics.  
 
Superior’s Uniform and Related Products segment markets itself to its customers as a "stock house." Therefore, Superior at all times carries substantial inventories of raw materials (principally piece goods) and finished garments, which requires substantial working capital. The segment’s principal raw materials are textile products. In 2016 and 2015, approximately 32% and 42%, respectively, of the segment’s products were obtained from suppliers located in Central America and Haiti, and approximately 31% and 26%, respectively, were sourced from or contained raw materials sourced from China. Superior does not believe that it is dependent upon any of its suppliers, despite the concentration of its purchasing from a few sources, as other suppliers of the same or similar products are readily available. However, if Superior’s Uniform and Related Products segment is unable to continue to obtain its products from Central America, Haiti and China, it could significantly disrupt Superior’s business. Because the Company manufactures and sources products in Central America, Haiti and China, the Company is affected by economic and political conditions in those countries, including possible employee turnover, labor and other unrest and lack of developed infrastructure, as well as decisions by the U.S. government to impose or increase import duties or other import regulations.
 
The Promotional Products segment relies on the supply of different types of raw materials, including plastic, glass, fabric and metal. Prices within the promotional products industry are directly affected by the cost of raw materials. The market for promotional products is price sensitive and has historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. The Promotional Products segment has flexibility in its suppliers, as other suppliers of the same or similar products are widely available. Additionally, the nature of the promotional products industry is such that should specific types of raw materials undergo significant cost increases, it is possible that alternative products using different materials could be utilized for similar promotional activities. However, if cost increases cannot be entirely passed on to customers and alternative suppliers or suitable product alternatives are unavailable, profit margins could decline. Moreover, because approximately 59% of the raw materials and products sourced by the Promotional Products segment in 2016 came from China, economic and political conditions in China or the United States, including those resulting in the imposition or increase of import duties and other import regulations, could have a material adverse effect on this business segment.

Intellectual Property
 
Superior owns and uses several trademarks and service marks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to its ability to market its products. Superior’s most significant trademark is its mark "Fashion Seal Healthcare " (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until August 6, 2017). We are in the process of renewing our registration of this trademark, which we expect to effectuate without difficulty. The Fashion Seal Healthcare trademark is critically important to the marketing and operation of Superior’s business, as more than 23% of Superior's products are sold under that name. 
Environmental Matters
 
In view of the nature of our business, compliance with federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had no material effect upon our operations or earnings, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the foreseeable future. 
Employees
 
Superior employed 1,632 persons, of which 1,620 were full-time employees, as of December 31, 2016.
