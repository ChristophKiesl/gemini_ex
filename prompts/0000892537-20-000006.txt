Our Employees
Our customers' successes are the end result of the hard work of our talented and dedicated employees.  At year end, our workforce consisted of approximately 8,900 employees, 68% of whom hold security clearances and approximately 45% of whom are veterans.  
Our Customers
We derive the vast majority of our revenues from U.S. government customers. We have successful, long-standing relationships with these customers, having supported many of them for almost half a century. 
Backlog
At December 31, 2019, our backlog was $9.1 billion, of which $1.3 billion was funded backlog. At December 31, 2018, our backlog was $8.4 billion, of which $1.3 billion was funded backlog.
We define backlog as our estimate of the remaining future revenue from existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to such contracts and including executed task orders issued under Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) contracts. We also include an estimate of revenue for solutions that we believe we will be asked to provide in the future under the terms of ID/IQ contracts for which there are established patterns of revenues.
We define funded backlog as the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and allocated to the contract by the purchasing agency or otherwise authorized for payment by the customer upon completion of a specified portion of work. 
Our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts because Congress often appropriates funds for a particular program or contract on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance over a much longer period of time.
A variety of circumstances or events may cause changes in the amount of our backlog and funded backlog, including the execution of new contracts, the extension of existing contracts, the non-renewal or completion of current contracts, the early termination of contracts, and adjustments to estimates for previously included contracts. Changes in the amount of our funded backlog also are affected by the funding cycles of the government.
Seasonality
Our business is not seasonal. However, in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds it is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before September 30, which is the end of the government fiscal year. Additionally, our quarterly results are impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. There are generally fewer working days for our employees to generate revenue in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. 
Competitive Landscape
We compete in a market shaped by customer requirements and federal budget priorities and constraints. Our key competitors currently include divisions of large defense contractors, as well as a number of large and mid-size U.S. government contractors with specialized capabilities. Because of the diverse requirements of U.S. government customers and the highly competitive nature of large procurements, we frequently collaborate with these and other companies to compete for large contracts and we bid against these companies in other situations.
