ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
On May 28, 2020, pursuant to the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 19, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among AYRO, Inc., a Delaware corporation previously known as DropCar, Inc., ABC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and AYRO Operating Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation previously known as AYRO, Inc. (“AYRO Operating”), Merger Sub was merged with and into AYRO Operating, with AYRO Operating continuing after the merger as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company” and “AYRO” refer to AYRO, Inc. and its subsidiaries. References to “DropCar” refer to DropCar, Inc. prior to the Merger. For more information on the merger or the sale of assets, see “Corporate History – Merger and” and “Corporate History – Closing of Asset Purchase Agreement.”
 
Overview
 
Prior to the Merger, DropCar provided consumer and enterprise solutions to urban automobile-related logistical challenges. Following the Merger, we design and manufacture compact, sustainable electric vehicles for closed campus mobility, urban and community transport, local on-demand and last mile delivery, and government use. Our four-wheeled purpose-built electric vehicles are geared toward commercial customers including universities, business and medical campuses, last mile delivery services and food service providers. We are currently designing our next generation three-wheeled vehicle to support the above-listed markets.
Products
 
AYRO vehicles provide the end user an environmentally friendly alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (cars powered by gasoline or diesel oil), for light duty uses, including low-speed logistics, maintenance and cargo services, at a lower total cost.
AYRO Club Car 411
 
The AYRO Club Car 411 (the “AYRO 411 Fleet”) is a family of electric, four-wheel compact, light-duty utility trucks sold exclusively through our contracted partner, Club Car, as part of a global multi-year sustainability solution development, sales and marketing agreement. Each of the AYRO 411 Fleet of vehicles is classified as a street legal low-speed vehicle (“LSV”), defined as a four-wheeled motor vehicle, other than an all-terrain vehicle, that is capable of reaching speeds of at least 20 miles per hour (“mph”) but not greater than 25 mph, with a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 3,000 pounds and meets the safety standards in Title 49 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, section 571.50.
 
The AYRO 411 Fleet has an expected range of up to 50 miles and a maximum speed range of 25 mph (or 40 kilometers per hour), in line with the United States Department of Transportation (“USDOT”) regulations for low-speed vehicles and with most state statutes, which typically limit the speed of LSVs to 25 mph on 35 mph posted roads. The current AYRO 411 Fleet includes:
 

● | the 411 Flatbed truck, which provides drivers with considerable versatility of use; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | the 411 Pickup truck, which is ideal for hauling; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the 411 Cargo Van Box, a fully enclosed cargo box. 
● | the 411 Cargo with Powered Van Box, a fully enclosed cargo box with multiple 120V power sources separate from the drivetrain that can support cargo refrigeration and heating. 

 
The AYRO 411 Fleet has zero gas emissions, a recharge capability of up to six to eight hours using 120V/20A outlets and a payload capacity of up to 1,100 pounds. We estimate that the AYRO 411 Fleet’s operating costs are approximately 50% lower per year compared to similarly sized gas-powered trucks/vans. Vehicles in the AYRO 411 Fleet are equipped with:
 

● | reinforced steel (coated) chassis houses the motor, controller and enclosed battery operating system; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | auto-grade suspension with Transverse Leaf Spring on the front and horizontal spring with coil-over shock in the rear; 
● | power assisted steering; 
● | street legal if registered/licensed per standard vehicles by dealer or user; 
● | multi-point, anchored DOT compliant safety harnesses for driver and passenger; 
● | a standard back-up camera (appears on larger LCD display – see below); 
● | a standard 7-inch (17.7 centimeter) LCD display; 
● | a standard manual parking break; 
● | four-wheel all-disk braking system and corrosion resistant body panels; and 
● | heating and ventilation systems in the cabin of the truck. 

 
With its low speed, zero-emissions, and cost-effectiveness, the AYRO 411 Fleet seeks to satisfy the needs of a variety of customers, including university and college campuses, retailers, airports and ports, business parks and campuses, warehouses, production facilities, resorts and theme parks, apartments and condos. We are currently working with our supply chain to add enhancements to the AYRO 411, initially designated the “AYRO 411x,” which is expected to be released in the second quarter of 2021.


Three-Wheeled Electric Vehicle Product Offerings
 
In addition to the AYRO 411 Fleet, we previously manufactured and sold the AYRO 311 Autocycle, a compact, three-wheeled electric vehicle (the “AYRO 311”). As the AYRO 311 was nearing end-of-life, on August 17, 2020 we sold our remaining AYRO 311 Fleet inventory to a third party for $0.12 million (the “311 Fleet Sale”). Upon such sale, we sustained a loss on disposal of $0.3 million. Subsequent to the 311 Fleet Sale, on February 12, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Arcimoto, Inc. to settle certain patent infringement claims (the “Arcimoto Settlement”), pursuant to which we agreed to cease the production, importation and sale of the AYRO 311, among other things. Accordingly, we would not be contractually permitted to resume production of the AYRO 311. We are continuing the development of an all-new, three-wheeled electric vehicle, which we intend to replace the AYRO 311 as our three-wheeled electric vehicle product offering. We expect to begin manufacturing our next generation three-wheeled vehicle in the first half of 2022.

Additional Models and Vehicles
 
We continue to invest in expanding our existing all-electric vehicle technologies, integrations and vertical market solutions, in addition to growing our fleet of purpose-engineered vehicles and services.
 
We are currently engineering an all-electric, purpose-built e-delivery vehicle. There are a number of design elements associated with the e-vehicle, configurable/powered e-modules and range of integrated contextual data exchanges and services.
 
We are also currently in discussions with Club Car regarding a variety of new models and vehicles.
 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 
Manufacturing Agreement with Cenntro
 
In 2017, AYRO Operating partnered with Cenntro Automotive Group, Ltd. (“Cenntro”), which operates a large electric vehicle factory in the automotive district in Hangzhou, China, in a supply chain agreement to provide sub-assembly manufacturing services. Through the partnership, Cenntro initially acquired 19% in 2017 of AYRO Operating’s common stock. Cenntro beneficially owned approximately 4.38% of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Cenntro owns the design of the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles and has granted us an exclusive license to purchase the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles for sale in North America.


Under our Manufacturing License Agreement with Cenntro (the “MLA”), in order for us to maintain our exclusive territorial rights pursuant to the MLA, for the first three years after the effective date of March 22, 2020, we must meet the following minimum purchase requirements, which we believe we satisfied for the initial period: (i) a minimum of 300 units sold by the first anniversary of the effective date of the MLA; (ii) a minimum of 800 units sold by the second anniversary of the effective date of the MLA; and (iii) a minimum of 1,300 units sold by the third anniversary of the effective date of the MLA. Cenntro will determine the minimum sale requirements for the years thereafter. Should any event of default occur, the other party may terminate the MLA by providing written notice to the defaulting party, who will have 90 days from the effective date of the notice to cure the default. Unless waived by the party providing notice, a failure to cure the default(s) within the 90-day time frame will result in the automatic termination of the MLA. Events of default under the MLA include a failure to make a required payment when due, the insolvency or bankruptcy of either party, the subjection of either party’s property to any levy, seizure, general assignment for the benefit of creditors, and a failure to make available or deliver the products in the time and manner provided for in the MLA.
 
Cenntro was also used to perform sub-assembly manufacturing of the AYRO 311. We import semi-knocked-down vehicle kits from Cenntro for the 411 model. We are no longer manufacturing and selling the AYRO 311 as we continue to develop our next generation three-wheeled vehicle. The vehicle kits are received through shipping containers by our assembly facility in Round Rock, Texas. The vehicles are then assembled with limited customization requirements per order. As such, the partnership with Cenntro allows us to scale manufacturing operations without significant investment in capital expenditures, and therefore bring products to market rapidly.

Final Assembly 
 
For final assembly of the 411, we currently occupy 24,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space configured in a “U”-shaped assembly line with multiple stations per vehicle. The chart below indicates the number of vehicles and assembly time required for each. Assembly time also includes USDOT quality checks and testing as the final step of the assembly process. Additionally, the number of vehicles indicated below assumes a single shift.

Vehicle | Assembly time (Man-Hours) | | Vehicle Assembly Capacity per month
---------+---------------------------+----+------------------------------------
AYRO 411 | | 12 | | 400*

 
*This capacity would decline if we begin production of future vehicle models.
 
Master Procurement Agreement with Club Car
 
In March 2019, we entered into a five-year Master Procurement Agreement (the “MPA”) with Club Car for the sale of our four-wheeled vehicles. The MPA granted Club Car the exclusive right to sell our four-wheeled vehicles in North America, provided that Club Car orders at least 500 vehicles per year.
 
Although Club Car did not meet the volume threshold for 2020, we currently have no intention of selling our four-wheeled vehicles other than exclusively through Club Car. Under the terms of the MPA, we receive orders from Club Car dealers for vehicles of specific configurations, and we invoice Club Car once the vehicle has shipped. The MPA has an initial term of five (5) years commencing January 1, 2019 and may be renewed by Club Car for successive one-year periods upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Pursuant to the MPA, we granted Club Car a right of first refusal for sales of 51% or more of AYRO Operating’s assets or equity interests, which right of first refusal is exercisable for a period of 45 days following delivery of an acquisition notice to Club Car. We also agreed to collaborate with Club Car on new products similar to its four-wheeled vehicle and improvements to existing products and granted Club Car a right of first refusal to purchase similar commercial utility vehicles which AYRO Operating may develop during the term of the MPA. We are currently engaged in discussions with Club Car to develop additional products to be sold by Club Car in Europe and Asia but there can be no assurance that these discussions will be successful.
 
Manufacturing Services Agreement with Karma
 
On September 25, 2020, we entered into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “Karma Agreement”) with Karma Automotive LLC (“Karma”), pursuant to which Karma agreed to provide certain manufacturing services for the production of our vehicles. The initial statement of work provides that Karma will perform assembly of a certain quantity of the AYRO 411 vehicles and provide testing, materials management and outbound logistics services. For such services in the initial statement of work, we agreed to pay $1.2 million to Karma, of which (i) $0.52 million was paid at closing and (ii) $0.64 million is due and payable five months following the satisfaction of certain production requirements.

-


The Karma Agreement expires (i) 12 months from the start of volume production of the vehicles or (ii) such earlier time as the parties mutually agree in writing. In addition, Karma, in its sole discretion, may terminate the Karma Agreement at any time, without cause, upon twelve months’ prior written notice. We may terminate the Karma Agreement, without cause, upon six months’ prior written notice.
 
Supply Agreement with Gallery Carts
 
During 2020, we entered into a supply agreement with Gallery Carts, a leading provider of food and beverage kiosks, carts, and mobile storefront solutions. Joint development efforts have led to the launch of the parties’ first all-electric configurable mobile hospitality vehicle for “on-the-go” venues across the United States. This innovative solution permits food, beverage and merchandising operators to bring goods directly to consumers.
 
The configurable Powered Vendor Box, in the rear of the vehicle, features long-life lithium batteries that power the preconfigured hot/cold beverage and food equipment and is directly integrated with the Club Car 411. The canopy doors, as well as the full vehicle, can be customized with end-user logos and graphics to enhance the brand experience. Gallery, with 40 years of experience delivering custom food kiosk solutions, has expanded into mobile electric vehicles as customers increasingly want food, beverages and merchandise delivered to where they are gathering. For example, a recent study conducted by Technomic found that a large majority of students, 77%, desired alternative mobile and to-go food options on campus.
 
Gallery, a premier distributor of Club Car 411 low-speed electric vehicles manufactured by AYRO, has a diverse clientele throughout mobile food, beverage and merchandise distribution markets, for key customer applications such as university, corporate and government campuses, major league and amateur-level stadiums and arenas, resorts, airports and event centers. In addition to finding innovative and safe ways to deliver food and beverages to their patrons, reducing and ultimately eliminating their carbon footprint is a top priority for many of these customers.


Strategic Partnership with Autonomic
 
Additionally, we are developing a technology platform that can be deployed to any vehicle as additional value-add subscriptions offered directly to the end customer. We have partnered with Autonomic, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Smart Mobility LLC, to collect vehicle health, use and location information (telematics) in its transportation mobility cloud and produce purpose-built information back to us, customers and fleet operators, generating an additional revenue stream. Working together, the companies aim to develop a range of services to enable mobility applications for our line of vehicles which power everything from moving products and equipment to people and last-mile delivery services.
Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to continue to develop and commercialize automotive-grade, sustainable electric transportation solutions for the markets and use cases that we believe can be well served by our purpose-built, street legal and road-ready electric vehicles. Our business strategy includes the following:

● | Leverage the relationship with Club Car to expand our product portfolio and increase our customer base. We are working on and have plans to expand our current electric transportation solutions portfolio in collaboration with Club Car. This plan includes next generation light duty trucks and new purpose-driven electric vehicles. Additionally, we are collaborating with Club Car’s sales and marketing teams to expand adoption of our vehicles in the United States and intend to expand our geographical footprint within Club Car’s global distribution and channel network. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scale up our operations to achieve growth. We intend to direct resources to scale up our operations, which we believe is needed to increase our revenue, including expanding and optimizing our automotive component supply chain and our flow-based assembly operations in Round Rock, Texas. Further, we plan to expand sales territories and add distribution channels, forming strategic partnerships to build-out our whole product offering and to access additional sales channels or to accelerate product adoption for particular vertical markets, building our brand, and increasing manufacturing capacity to produce higher volumes of electric vehicles.

Trends Driving the Need for Electric Vehicles
 
The U.S. electric vehicle market is expected by many commentators to increase dramatically over the next decade, driven by factors such as the country’s increasingly urbanized population, the significant cost of owning and operating gas-powered vehicles, the growing global awareness of the damaging effects of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and rising investment in clean technology and supporting infrastructure.
 
A segment of the electric vehicle market, low speed electric vehicles (“LSEVs”)—which are LSVs but cannot be powered by gas or diesel fuel—are growing increasingly popular as eco-friendly options for consumers and commercial entities. LSEVs run on electric motors fueled by a variety of different batteries, such as lithium ion, molten salt, zinc-air and various nickel-based designs.
 
In 2017, the global LSEV market was valued at approximately $2.4 billion, according to Allied Market Research, and global sales of LSEVs have only continued to grow over the past two years, with sales expected to reach 1.5 million units in 2021. According to the Low Speed Electric Vehicles Market report conducted by Market Study Report, over the next five years, the LSEV market is expected to register a 10.8% compound annual growth rate in terms of revenue, with the global market size expected to reach $8.9 billion by 2024, up from $4.8 billion in 2019.
 
Trends such as increasingly stringent government regulations aimed toward reducing vehicle emissions, growing urban populations, and social pressure to adopt sustainable lifestyles all create a demand for more ecologically and economically sustainable methods of transportation. This demand continues to spur technological advancements and LSEV market growth.
 
Incentivizing Effect of Government Rules and Regulations. Expanding rules and regulations governing vehicle emissions have contributed to growth in the LSEV market. In particular, the U.S., Germany, France, and China have implemented stringent laws and regulations governing vehicular emissions, requiring automobile manufacturers to use advanced technologies to combat high-emission levels in vehicles. To incentivize clean-energy use, many governments are increasingly instituting substantial incentives for consumers to purchase electric vehicles, such as:
 

● | tax credits, rebates, and exemptions; reduced vehicle registration fees; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reduced utility rates; and 
● | parking incentives. 

 
Further, governments are establishing infrastructure benchmarks to support the growth of the electric vehicle industry.

A prime example of government involvement in developing the electric vehicle industry, a recent New Jersey bill aims to have 330,000 electric vehicles on state roads by the end of 2024 and a total of 2.0 million by 2035. To facilitate this goal, the bill calls for the state to have 400 fast-charging stations and another 1,000 slow-charging stations, both by 2025. Thirty percent of all apartment, condo and townhouse developments in New Jersey would need to have chargers by 2030, while half of all franchise hotels would need to have chargers by 2050. As the network of government rules and regulations expands, so too should investment in the research and development of LSEV technology and infrastructure.
 
Urbanization on the Rise. According to the U.N., in 2015, 55% of the world’s population was urban, and by 2050, it is estimated that this percentage will increase to 68%. As the world population continues to urbanize, a growing number of consumers are expected to seek alternatives, such as LSEVs, to internal combustion engine vehicles in order to save money and space in congested city streets.
 
Increasing Sense of Social Responsibility. In tandem with governmental efforts to curb pollution and encourage more sustainable transportation practices, consumers face increasing social pressure to adopt eco-friendly lifestyles. As this demand grows, the LSEV market should continue to develop.
 
Competition and Market Opportunities
 
The worldwide automotive market, particularly for economy and alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive, and we expect it will become even more so in the future. Other manufacturers have entered the three- and four-wheeled vehicle markets, and we expect additional competitors to enter this market within the next several years. As the LSEV market grows increasingly saturated, we expect to experience significant competition. The most competitive companies in the global LSEV market include HDK Electric Vehicles, Bradshaw Electric Vehicles, Textron Inc., Polaris Industries, Yamaha Motors Co. Ltd., Ingersoll Rand, Inc., Speedway Electric, AGT Electric Cars, Bintelli Electric Vehicles and Ligier Group. Our relationship with Club Car, a division of Ingersoll Rand, Inc., gives us a strong competitive advantage. Despite this fact, many of the other competitors listed above have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than us and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Many of these competitors modify an existing fossil-fuel powered golf cart to meet utility and commercial needs for an all-electric commercial utility vehicle, unlike the AYRO 411 Fleet, which was engineered, designed and produced as a portfolio of electric, light duty trucks and vans.
 
When compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, our vehicles are significantly more attractive based on tax, title and license fees and CO2 emissions. Compared to a standard Ford F150 (gasoline) pickup truck (2.7 liter), the AYRO 411 Fleet provides an approximate 49% reduction in operating expenses and an approximate 100% reduction in CO2 emissions (if renewed energy is used to charge the AYRO vehicles, an increasing trend for most higher education campuses and government facilities).
 
Our most closely-matched competitor in the LSEV industry is Polaris Gem (“Gem”), an LSEV manufacturer that manufactures products designed for applications similar to ours. Gem offers three passenger vehicle models and two utility vehicle models. Although Gem’s GEM el XD model, which is similar to vehicles in the AYRO 411 Fleet, has a lower starting MSRP than the AYRO 411 Fleet, the GEM el XD would need to be highly configured to match the standard AYRO 411 Fleet features and, with such configuration, would exceed the base MSRP of each vehicle in the AYRO 411 Fleet. The AYRO 411 Fleet has a greater pick-up bed and van box capacity that the GEM el XD, in addition to 13% more horsepower and a 48% better turning radius, allowing drivers of the AYRO 411 Fleet to execute maneuvers in tighter spaces than they would using the GEM el XD.

We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in downward price pressure and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our vehicles or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
 
Target Markets
 
The multipurpose applications and clean energy use of LSEVs make them popular across a wide array of industries and customers, including college and university campuses, resorts and hotels, corporate parks, hospitals, warehouses, individual consumers, last mile delivery service providers, municipalities, and the food service industry. A number of these market segments, and our competitive position within them, are discussed in greater detail below.
Universities. LSEVs are growing increasingly common on university and college campuses due to a number of factors. LSEVs fulfil the versatile needs of campuses better than golf carts or standard combustion vehicles because, not only does LSEVs’ low speed threshold promote safer driving among pedestrians, the vehicles are also street legal with on-road safety features, enabling drivers to drive on roads and free up pedestrian space along sidewalks and smaller pathways. Additionally, the significantly reduced carbon imprint of LSEVs compared to internal combustion engine vehicles appeal to environmentally aware students and professors looking to promote environmental sustainability on campus. By transitioning from internal combustion engine vehicles to LSEVs, campuses should be able to reduce significantly the costs spent on fuel, oil, parts, and maintenance. Our AYRO 411 Fleet provides all of these benefits to university and college campuses. We estimate that in the U.S., there are over 1,800 higher education campuses with over 10,000 students each with over 400 on-campus vehicles that are ideal targets for the AYRO 411 Fleet as campuses transition from fossil-fueled campus fleet vehicles to EVs.
Food Delivery Services. As the millennial generation assumes a more substantial portion of the consumer population, customers increasingly favor convenience and timeliness, spurring dramatic growth in online ordering and delivery services across a wide swath of industries, including food delivery and restaurant ordering services. Food delivery sales are anticipated to increase over 20% per year, culminating in an expected $365 billion worldwide by 2030, according to Upserve. Upserve further estimates that approximately 60% of U.S. consumers report that they order delivery or takeout at least once a week. Within the next decade, potentially over 40% of restaurant sales will be attributable to delivery services, according to Morgan Stanley. In our market research, we have determined that delivery services, including restaurants using the next generation three-wheeled vehicle as a delivery vehicle rather than outsourcing delivery to third party services, would reduce their delivery costs by up to 50%. Delivery service companies using our next generation three-wheeled vehicle as an in-house delivery vehicle rather than outsourcing delivery would also be better equipped to manage the customer experience and maintain customer relationships and data.

Last Mile Delivery Service. Retail focus on last mile delivery—the movement of goods from a transportation hub to the final delivery destination—has grown exponentially over the past few years due to the rise in online ordering and e-commerce. Consumers’ ability to pick and choose products based on delivery speed and availability makes last mile delivery a key differentiator among retailers. Last mile delivery provides retailers timelier and more convenient delivery options not offered by the main three shipping services in the U.S. (the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS). Additionally, given the increasing designation of low emission zones in urban centers, retailers will need to continue to deploy eco-friendly vehicles. Retailers will likely expand the use of LSEV fleets to make deliveries in low emission zones due to their zero gas emissions and lower price than competing electric vehicles. We expect that the AYRO 411 Fleet, with its variety of cargo bed options ideal for hauling and delivery and its low price point, should stand out among the competition.
 
Municipalities. As more city governments adopt regulations geared toward reducing pollution from vehicles, cities are increasingly looking to replace their municipal vehicles with zero-emission fleets. Such fleet overhauls, however, can be costly. LSEVs are a cheaper and more practical option for cities daunted by the cost of standard electronic vehicles. Our LSEVs have both on and off-road capabilities, making them particularly versatile for municipalities.
 
On-Road and Personal Transportation. LSEVs offer a feasible and practical method of transportation, especially in urban centers. Because our LSEVs are street legal, they offer city dwellers a more sustainable, cost-efficient, easily maneuverable, compact and light weight option compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. Our LSEVs also offer a variety of specifications and equipment, meaning that consumers do not have to sacrifice comfort or convenience.
 
We primarily focus on the LSEV North American market, which is highly competitive and constitutes 28% of the global LSEV market according to Wise Guy Reports. We have examined various considerations with regard to our market impact, including cost comparisons to existing vehicles in the market, market validation and target commercial markets.
 
Business Developments
 
On September 25, 2020, we entered into the Karma Agreement with Karma. The term of the contract is for 12 months. Pursuant to the agreement Karma will provide certain manufacturing services, starting in 2021, under an attached statement of work including final assembly, raw material storage and logistical support of AYRO’s vehicles in return for compensation of $1.2 million. We paid Karma an amount of $0.52 million which was recorded as prepaid expense as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we made a cash payment of $0.08 million and issued warrants to an advisor to the transaction at signing of the contract with a fair value of $0.07 million.
Resources
 
We source our semi-knocked-down kits for the AYRO 411 from Cenntro. While many of their components are commercial off-the-shelf (“COTS”) parts, many are specific to the 411 product and are subject to raw material limitations. However, in designing our next generation three-wheeled vehicle, we are endeavoring to reduce supply risk by designing the vehicle to use as many COTS components as possible. Additionally, we are designing the platform for our next generation three-wheeled vehicle to fit replacement parts from multiple suppliers, which helps us reduce our resource supply risk.

Intellectual Property
 
As we expand our vehicle & service roadmaps, and integrated technologies, our focus on identifying specific market and customer needs continues to drive purpose-built engineering efforts.
 
Leveraging the all-electric AYRO 411 Fleet LSV and Non- LSV Vehicles, we develop applications or use case solutions optimized for the storage, delivery and logistics for delivering food, beverages, merchandise, equipment, tools and related goods. This is accomplished by integrating application-specific appliances, storage facilities, vehicle wraps and brands and related items. We leverage either integrated traction or a separate battery power system to provide AC power to the various appliances and solution elements. We are filing and have filed a number of provisional utility and/or design patents associated with the aforementioned verticalization development, and we have filed for both in the United States and internationally trademarks to cover the company name, company logo, and certain other key product and service marks. We continue to focus on innovative and applicable electric vehicle optimization designs that serve an expanding customer and application use base.
Patents
 
We currently have United States registrations for two design patents. Both were issued on February 11, 2020 and will expire on February 11, 2035. In addition to these issued patents, we have numerous non-public patent applications on file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).

Government Regulations
 
Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting AYRO are discussed below.

Mobile Source Emissions Control
 
The federal Clean Air Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that lawfully may be emitted by new vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United States. The current (“Tier 2”) emissions regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, set standards for motorcycles. Tier 2 emissions standards also establish durability requirements for emissions components to 5 years or 30,000 kilometers.
 
California has received a waiver from the EPA to establish its own unique emissions control standards for certain regulated pollutants. New vehicles and engines sold in California must be certified by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). CARB’s emissions standards for motorcycles are in line with those of the EPA. We currently expect that our vehicles will meet and exceed both the EPA’s and CARB’s standards.
 
Motor Vehicle Safety
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) defines a motorcycle as “a motor vehicle with motive power having a seat or saddle for the use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than three wheels in contact with the ground.” In order for a manufacturer to sell motorcycles in the U.S., the manufacturer has to self-certify to meet a certain set of regulatory requirements promulgated by the NHTSA in its Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”).
 
AYRO’s FMVSS strategy is designed to meet both federal motorcycle and state-specific autocycle requirements, as applicable, and conform as much as possible to automotive FMVSS requirements while not violating the motorcycle requirements that AYRO must meet.
 
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, or “Safety Act,” regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard If we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.
 
Operator’s License and Helmet Requirements
 
State regulations regarding operator licensing and occupant helmet requirements are currently a nationwide patchwork with regard to certain three-wheeled vehicles that may be classified as autocycles. While the strong majority of states have some form of exemption from helmet and motorcycle license requirements for three-wheeled vehicles qualifying as autocycles, the specific wording of each state’s statute may or may not include our three-wheeled vehicles. For example, in a selection of our larger market potential states of California, Texas and Florida, three-wheeled vehicles that are “fully enclosed” or “enclosed cab” are exempt from helmet and motorcycle endorsement requirements. In addition, for states that have passed specific autocycle requirements, many require that the vehicle have standard operating controls (accelerator and brakes) and a standard steering wheel, plus additional requirements. Our three-wheeled vehicles will offer standard controls to meet requirements aligned with these elements.
 
Our advocacy strategy involves creating a plan to work with state legislatures to advocate the normalization of these rules to reduce consumer confusion in the marketplace that comes from conflicting state-by-state regulations. Additionally, new products brought to market are designed in accordance with the most-restrictive state autocycle and vehicle laws so as to comply with all state laws and regulations.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) Certification
 
Our product programs are built on plug-in electric, zero emissions platforms. We report federal and state emissions data consistent with 10 CFR 474 and CARB requirements for Zero-Emission Vehicle certification.
Electromagnetic Compatibility
 
The Federal Communications Commission is the federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the communications law and regulations, including title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, specifically Part 15, which regulates unlicensed radio-frequency transmissions, both intentional and unintentional. With very few exceptions, all electronics devices must be reviewed to comply with Part 15 before they can be advertised or sold in the U.S. market.
Motor Vehicle Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
 
As with helmet laws and driver license requirements, state laws that regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of motor vehicles are a patchwork, nationwide. Our agreement with Club Car aims to provide U.S. and targeted countries channel and dealer coverage. For our electric vehicles, outside of our collaboration with Club Car or another third-party sales/distribution white label partner, we plan on a multi-faceted approach to sales, including exploring the following: (i) developing an expanded network of channel partners; (ii) entering into direct sales via a national leasing company that will in turn consummate sales with end users in a variety of states; and/or (iii) opening facilities in high growth states and delivering the vehicle to the end user via a common carrier.
 
We are registered as a manufacturer in Texas, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Florida and Arizona.
 
Pollution Control Costs
 
We are required to comply with stationary source air pollution, water pollution, and hazardous waste control standards that are now in effect or are scheduled to come into effect with respect to our manufacturing operations.
Research and Development
 
Our product development and engineering efforts align with the Society of Automotive Engineering (“SAE”) J2258_201611 standards for Light Utility Vehicles. The J2258 standard provides key compliance criteria for Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (“GVWR”), occupant protection and safety restraint systems, lateral and longitudinal stability, center of gravity and operating controls, among others. Our test validation and inspection standards follow FMVSS 49 CFR 571.500 for LSVs with the additions of SAE J585 and FMVSS 111 for rear visibility, lighting, signaling, reflectors, changes in direction of movement, back-up camera response timing and field of view.
 
Our development standards and test compliance validation processes are supported by a variety of test documentation including supplier self-reporting, third party laboratory test reports and regional compliance validation with CARB for speed, range and environmental performance.

Our production system follows a lean, cell-based manufacturing model. The process involves the following five sequential cells: (1) cab preparation, (2) chassis preparation, (3) system integration and testing, (4) final assembly and integration test, and (5) QA & FMVSS Compliance. Assembly quality and shift efficiency metrics are measured daily by our production staff at end of every shift.
 
We maintain a certification and compliance check list for each vehicle. Our three and four-wheeled vehicles use an automotive style steering wheel, turn signal stalk, headlight, running light and reverse light controls, a multi-speed windshield wiper and washer and an accelerator and brake pedal consistent with controls employed in standard passenger cars. As the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles are direct drive vehicles, there is no stick shift, clutch, paddle shift, or belt driven CSV (continuously variable) transmission needed to operate the vehicles within the intended torque band and speed range. Accordingly, our vehicles are homologated under existing U.S., state and local LSV requirements and the corresponding motorcycle and autocycle requirements under 49 CFR 571.3.

Corporate History
 
Merger
 
On May 28, 2020, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, by and among the Company, Merger Sub, and AYRO Operating, Merger Sub was merged with and into AYRO Operating, with AYRO Operating continuing after the merger as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the effective time of the Merger, without any action on the part of any stockholder, each issued and outstanding share of AYRO Operating’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “AYRO Operating Common Stock”), including shares underlying AYRO Operating’s outstanding equity awards and warrants, was converted into the right to receive 1.3634 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”). Immediately following the effective time of the Merger, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), and immediately following the Reverse Stock Split, the Company issued a stock dividend of one share of Company Common Stock for each outstanding share of AYRO Operating Common Stock to all holders of record immediately following the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split (the “Stock Dividend”). The net result of the Reverse Stock Split and the Stock Dividend was a 1-for-5 reverse stock split. Upon completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement and assuming the exercise in full of all pre-funded warrants issued pursuant thereto, (i) the former AYRO Operating equity holders (including the investors in a bridge financing and in private placements that closed prior to closing of the Merger) owned approximately 79% of the outstanding equity of the Company; (ii) former DropCar stockholders owned approximately 18% of the outstanding equity of the Company; and (iii) a financial advisor to DropCar and AYRO owned approximately 3% of the outstanding equity of the Company.

The Merger was treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes because substantially all of DropCar, Inc.’s operations were disposed of as part of the consummation of the Merger and therefore no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded by the Company as a result of the Merger. AYRO Operating was treated as the accounting acquirer, as its stockholders controlled the Company after the Merger, even though DropCar, Inc. was the legal acquirer. As a result, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in our consolidated financial statements are those of AYRO Operating as if AYRO Operating had always been the reporting company. All references to AYRO Operating, Inc. shares of common stock, warrants and options have been presented on a post-merger, post-reverse split basis.
 
Closing of Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On December 19, 2019, DropCar entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with DC Partners Acquisition, LLC (“DC Partners”), Spencer Richardson and David Newman, pursuant to which DropCar agreed to sell substantially all of the assets associated with its business of providing vehicle support, fleet logistics and concierge services for both consumers and the automotive industry to an entity controlled by Messrs. Richardson and Newman, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Business Development Officer at the time, respectively. The aggregate purchase price for the purchased assets consisted of the cancellation of certain liabilities pursuant to those certain employment agreements by and between DropCar and each of Messrs. Richardson and Newman, plus the assumption of certain liabilities relating to, or arising out of, workers’ compensation claims that occurred prior to the closing date of the Asset Purchase Agreement. On May 28, 2020, the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement Amendment”), which Asset Purchase Agreement Amendment (i) provides for the inclusion of up to $0.03 million in refunds associated with certain insurance premiums as assets being purchased by DC Partners, (ii) amends the covenant associated with the funding of the DropCar business, such that DropCar provided the DropCar business with additional funding of approximately $0.18 million at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement and (iii) provides for a current employee of the Company being transferred to DC Partners to provide transition services to the Company for a period of three months after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Asset Purchase Agreement closed on May 28, 2020, immediately following the consummation of the Merger.
