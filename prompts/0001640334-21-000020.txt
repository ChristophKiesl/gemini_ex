ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 5, 2015.
 
On August 22, 2017, each of Blaine Redfern and Morgan Powell, who were the controlling stockholders of the Company at that time, entered into and closed stock purchase and sale transactions pursuant to which they each sold 5,000,000 restricted shares of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Company, or, in the aggregate, 10,000,000 shares of the Common Stock being all of the outstanding restricted Common Stock of the Company, to Mr. Chao Ma. These transactions were completed at a price per share of $0.030320, for an aggregate amount of $303,200, pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement. 
 
In connection with the closing of the stock purchase transactions discussed above, on August 22, 2017, Mr. Redfern and Mr. Powell submitted their resignation letters, pursuant to which they each resigned from all positions they held as directors and officers of the Company, effective as of the closing of the stock purchase transactions. Effective as of August 22, 2017, upon resignation of Mr. Redfern and Mr. Powell, Mr. Ma was appointed to the board of the directors (the “Board”). Mr. Ma was also appointed as the President, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company.
 
On June 20, 2019, Mr. Ma, closed stock purchase and sale transactions pursuant to which he sold an aggregate of 10,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s Common Stock, to certain purchasers at a purchase price of $0.035 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $350,000. In connection with the closing of the stock purchase transactions, Mr, Ma resigned from all of the positions he held with the Company, effective as of the closing of the stock purchase transactions. One of the purchasers of restricted shares, Kynson Health Limited, a BVI entity, purchased 9,985,329 restricted shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $349,486. Kynson Health Limited is owned 100% by OuYang XingYing, who was appointed as the Company’s President, Secretary and Treasurer and director on June 20, 2019, upon the closing of the stock purchase and sale transactions and resignation of Mr. Ma.
 
The Company is a shell company, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Initially, the Company planned to develop a business that specialized in marketing health and wellness vacations to both individuals and corporate groups looking to revitalize and develop a fuller day-to-day life. Because we were not able to raise sufficient capital to execute our original business plan, the Company ceased that line of business and is now seeking a business combination with a private entity whose business would present an opportunity for its shareholders. 
 
Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict discretion of our Board of to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities.

We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation, or one that is in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.
 
We believe that there are numerous companies seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. These benefits are commonly thought to include the following:
 

• | the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | increased visibility in the marketplace; 
• | greater ease of borrowing from financial institutions; 
• | improved stock trading efficiency 
• | greater shareholder liquidity; 
• | greater ease in subsequently raising capital; 
• | ability to compensate key employees through stock options and other equity awards;
• | enhanced corporate image; and 
• | a presence in the United States capital markets. 



It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of a transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on that market.
 
With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with target company management are expected to focus on the percentage of our company that the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our existing shareholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our shareholders at such time.
 
We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, and will include miscellaneous other terms.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred.
 
Competition
 
We expect to encounter substantial competition in our efforts to identify and consummate a transaction with a business opportunity. The primary competition will be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, small venture capital partnerships and corporations, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, all of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.

Employees 
 
We presently have no employees apart from Ms. OuYang XingYing, our sole officer and director. Ms. Yang is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that she will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
 
We intend to hire additional management and other support personnel when we have reached a point in our proposed growth that would allow for such employment. In the interim, we will rely upon consultants to assist us in identifying and investigating acquisition opportunities.
