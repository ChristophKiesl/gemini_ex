ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Paysign, Inc. (the “Company,” “Paysign,” “we” or “our”) amended our articles of incorporation and changed our name from 3PEA International, Inc. to Paysign, Inc. on April 23, 2019. Additionally, we changed our trading symbol on the Nasdaq Capital Market to “PAYS.” The Company acquired 3Pea Technologies, Inc., a payment solutions company, in March 2006, which resulted in 3Pea Technologies, Inc. becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.
Business of Issuer
 
Paysign, Inc. is a vertically integrated provider of prepaid card products and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications. Our payment solutions are utilized by our corporate customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, increase patient adherence rates, reduce administration costs and streamline operations. Public sector organizations can utilize our payment solutions to disburse public benefits or for internal payments. We market our prepaid card solutions under our Paysign® brand. As we are a payment processor and prepaid card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the prepaid card lifecycle.
 
We provide a card processing platform consisting of proprietary systems and software applications based on the unique needs of our clients. We have extended our processing business capabilities through our proprietary Paysign platform. Through the Paysign platform, we provide a variety of services including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service. The Paysign platform was built on modern cross-platform architecture and designed to be highly flexible, scalable and customizable. The platform’s flexibility and ease of customization has allowed us to expand our operational capabilities by facilitating our entry into new markets within the payments space. The Paysign platform delivers cost benefits and revenue building opportunities to our partners.
 
We have developed prepaid card programs for corporate incentive and rewards including, but not limited to, consumer rebates and rewards, donor compensation, clinical trials, healthcare reimbursement payments and pharmaceutical payment assistance. We have expanded our product offerings to include additional corporate incentive products and demand deposit accounts accessible with a debit card. In the future, we expect to further expand our product offerings into other prepaid card offerings such as payroll cards, travel cards, and expense reimbursement cards. Our cards are sponsored by our issuing bank partners.
 
Our revenues include fees generated from cardholder fees, interchange, card program management fees, and settlement income. Revenue from cardholder fees, interchange and card program management fees is recorded when the performance obligation is fulfilled. Settlement income is recorded at the expiration of the card program.
 
What Are Prepaid Cards?
 
A prepaid card is a payment product that is pre-funded and not directly linked to an individual bank account. Prepaid cards are unlike debit cards that are attached to a personal or business checking account and draw funds from that linked account or a credit card that draws funds from a line of credit.
 
Prepaid cards can either be open-loop, closed-loop, or restricted-loop. Open-loop, or network-branded, prepaid cards carry an acceptance mark of a national or international payment network such as American Express, Discover, Mastercard or Visa and can be used anywhere that card brand is accepted. Closed-loop prepaid cards can only be used at a specific merchant whose name is typically branded on the card and are most likely not network branded. Restricted-loop prepaid cards may carry a network brand and can be used only at a specific group of non-affiliated merchant locations such as a shopping mall or a specific merchant category.

Open-loop, and some restricted-loop, prepaid cards are issued by a financial institution under a license of the payment network. Open-loop prepaid cards provide consumers, businesses and governments with the efficiency, security and flexibility of digital payments reducing costs associated with handling cash, checks and other paper-based payment processes, and provides the end user a payment product that is accessible and with global utility, convenient, safer than cash, can be used as a budgeting tool and contains protections against fraud and theft.
 
The prepaid market continues to experience significant growth due to consumers, corporations and governments embracing improved technology, greater convenience, more product choices and greater flexibility. Prepaid cards have also proven to be an attractive alternative to traditional bank accounts for certain segments of the population, particularly those without, or who could not qualify for, a checking or savings account.
 
The Mercator Advisory Group’s 17th Annual U.S. Open Loop Prepaid Cards Market Forecast 2020-2024, shows that $374 billion was loaded on open-loop prepaid cards in the United States in 2019 and they are forecasting that total open-loop loads will have a compound annual growth rate of 4.1% between 2020 and 2024, to $466.2 billion being loaded in 2024.
 
Consumers, both banked and unbanked, use prepaid cards such as general purpose reloadable (GPR) cards, to conduct their day-to-day financial transactions such as paying bills, depositing checks, and receiving direct deposits. According to the 2019 FDIC Survey of Household Use of Banking and Financial Services, 8.5% of U.S. households or approximately 128 million households, use GPR prepaid cards.
 
Common Examples of Prepaid Cards
 
The prepaid card market is divided into three macro categories based on who funds the card account. These categories are consumer-funded, corporate-funded and government-funded.
 
Consumer-Funded Programs: The consumer prepaid category consists of products such as general purpose reloadable (GPR) cards, gift cards, travel money cards, and remittance/peer-to-peer (“P2P”) cards.
 
General Purpose Reloadable Cards: A type of prepaid card typically purchased by a consumer for his/her personal use to pay for purchases, pay bills and/or access cash at ATMs. GPR cards may be purchased online and in retail locations from a variety of providers. Funds may be loaded onto the card by direct deposit of wages or benefits or at retail locations offering prepaid card reload services.
Gift Cards: A non-reloadable prepaid card that is purchased by a gift giver to be given to a gift recipient.
 
Corporate-Funded Programs: The corporate prepaid category consists of products such as employee/partner incentives, consumer incentives, payroll, employee benefits, healthcare, corporate expense and business travel, insurance claim disbursement, etc.
Our Products and Services
 
As a payment processor and prepaid card program manager, our payment solutions are utilized by our customers as a means to increase customer loyalty, increase brand recognition, reward customers, agents and employees while reducing administration costs and streamlining operations. We manage all aspects of the prepaid card lifecycle, from the card design and approval processes with partners and networks, to production, packaging, distribution, and personalization. We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, and lost and stolen card management and replacement. We provide in-house customer service which includes live bilingual customer care representatives staffed 24/7/365. We also run in-house Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and two-way SMS messaging platforms. As we do not have our own banking license to issue open-loop prepaid cards, our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with bank issuers.

As an end-to-end payment processor and prepaid card program manager, we derive our revenue from all stages of the card lifecycle. These revenues can include fees from program set-up; customization and development; data processing and report generation; card production and fulfillment; transaction fees derived from card usage; inactivity fees; card replacement fees; program administration fees; and settlement income.
 
To date, we have issued millions of prepaid cards under programs implemented for Fortune 500 companies, multinationals, as well as top pharmaceutical manufacturers, universities and social media companies.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3.5 million cardholders participating in approximately 360 card programs.
 
In our early years of operations, we focused mainly on providing co-pay assistance prepaid cards to the pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, we began marketing a corporate incentive prepaid card-based payment solution targeting the plasma donation industry. More recently, having built the necessary infrastructure and added essential staff, we have increased our focus and sales efforts on corporate incentive and corporate expense card programs as well as retargeting the pharmaceutical industry with co-pay assistance, buy and bill and other prepaid programs designed to maximize patient enrollment, adherence and retention.
 
The Paysign® Brand
 
In order to leverage the capabilities of the Paysign platform and successfully expand our product offerings, we established the Paysign brand of prepaid cards and solutions. The Paysign brand encompasses all of our current and future prepaid product offerings, including but not limited to, corporate incentives, healthcare related payment solutions for clinical trials, donations and co-pay assistance, payroll, settlement payments, corporate expense cards and solutions designed for the public sector as well as general purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Paysign is a registered trademark of the Company in the United States and other countries.
Corporate Incentives
 
Our Paysign corporate incentive cards offer businesses a practical and contemporary way to reward and motivate existing and potential customers, employees, donors, patients, clinical trial participants, sales professionals, agents and distributors. We develop incentive card programs, either traditional plastic or virtual, that our customers use for a wide variety of applications, including but not limited to: consumer rebates for large purchases or frequent buyers; trade incentives for third party distributors; new product launches and commission based sales incentives; consumer promotions such as automobile test drives; purchase incentives; loyalty rewards; compensation for the time and effort of donating; pharmaceutical payment assistance; referral programs; event giveaways; and purchase incentives. The Paysign solution can be integrated into existing payment management systems or act as a stand-alone solution. All Paysign cards are accepted anywhere Visa is accepted.
 
Key benefits of our corporate incentive cards are:
 

· | Reduced costs: Operating and administrative costs associated with processing traditional paper checks are reduced. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Co-Branding: Our clients can promote their brands as the card can include the corporate sponsor’s logo. The card itself advertises the sponsor’s brand. 
· | Customization: Our Paysign platform allows for easy customization of our corporate incentive card products. For example, our clients can select merchants or merchant categories which dictate where the card will be accepted. Our clients can receive customized reports, track card usage and attach surveys to the activation process to gain market intelligence.
· | Speed to Market: Our clients can get rewards and incentives to the intended recipients in a much quicker manner than traditional methods using our corporate incentive card products.

Per Diem/ Corporate Expense Payments
 
Per Diem, Corporate Expense and Business Travel Cards are reloadable prepaid card that allows businesses, non –profits and government agencies the ability to control employee spending while reducing administration costs by eliminating the need for traditional expense reports. We are currently focusing on marketing these card products to large corporations.
Pharmaceutical Market
 
Our Paysign solutions for the pharmaceutical industry are a specialized, adjudicated solution that pays all or a portion of a patient’s out-of-pocket costs associated with a prescription drug purchase. Funds are provided by the sponsoring pharmaceutical company for use at retail pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, hospitals, doctors’ offices and clinics nationwide.
 
Our pharmaceutical solutions provide payment claims processing and other administrative services for clients, in real-time, according to client benefit plan designs. Our solutions present a cost-effective payment delivery vehicle by providing real-time financial benefit for both consumers and pharmaceutical companies. Our offerings also allow clients to directly manage more of their pharmacy benefits and include pharmacy claims adjudication, network and payment administration, client call center service and support, reporting, rebate management, as well as implementation, training and account management.
 
Co-Pay Assistance Program
 
Our Co-Pay Assistance Program is a pharmaceutical payment card product which is adjudicated as a secondary claim at the point of purchase. The adjudication process determines what funds will be loaded onto the card by applying business rules designed by the pharmaceutical company. The loaded funds are then immediately applied to the prescription purchase at the point of purchase for the patient benefit. The card is used to defray out-of-pocket costs for the prescription. Key features and benefits of our Paysign card for the Co-Pay Assistance Program are:

· | Tracking and auditing "free samples" is no longer required, as the retail pharmacy network serves as the distribution mechanism for new prescriber promotions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The patient's primary insurance pays the standard adjudicated amount for prescription fills that would historically be "free samples".
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The distribution of cards enables far superior prescriber and patient data collection for the sponsoring pharmaceutical company through the use of automated questionnaires required to activate the cards.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The marketing programs can be better designed to meet the specifications and needs of the sponsoring pharmaceutical company as compared to programs involving the distribution of physical samples.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Because the card operates like a debit card, pharmacy retailers are paid instantly for the adjudicated promotional cost on covered prescription transactions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We provide a set of comprehensive, customizable reporting modules to our pharmaceutical clients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buy and Bill Program
 
Where Paysign’s standard pharmaceutical Co-Pay Assistance Program provides payment for self-administered pharmaceuticals purchased at a pharmacy, Paysign’s Buy and Bill Program is designed to provide a benefit for patients when purchasing directly from their physician’s office or through an infusion center for physician administered therapies.

Source Plasma Donor Payments 
 
Plasma derived therapies are lifesaving treatments used to treat various rare conditions. Plasma based therapies are manufactured using human plasma, which is the yellow liquid portion of whole blood that can be easily replaced by the body. Plasma makes up approximately 55 percent of whole blood and consists primarily of water and proteins. Source plasma is the plasma collected from individual donors that serves as the raw material for the further manufacture into these lifesaving therapies. Historically, source plasma donation centers compensated their donors with cash or checks. Over the past several years, plasma donation centers have migrated to a prepaid card solution for donor payments.
 
The Company offers a comprehensive customized payment solution for source plasma collection centers under the Paysign brand. The solution consists of the Paysign Plasma Donor Compensation Prepaid Card, the Paysign Partner Portal for administrators, and the Paysign Kiosk. The solution offers customized reporting and provides a level of business analytics previously unavailable. The solution can be utilized either as a stand-alone web-based solution or integrated with existing donor management systems, giving plasma donation centers an increased level of flexibility. The Company entered the market in late 2011 and has seen significant growth in this market segment. Currently, the Company services approximately 36% of the plasma collection centers in the US.
 
DDA Debit Cards—Paysign Premier
 
Recently, providers of GPR card products, in response to changes in the regulatory environment, have introduced new products similar to a GPR card but that act as true demand deposit accounts accessible with a debit card (“DDA Debit Card”). These DDA Debit Cards offer many of the features and functionalities of a traditional debit card associated with a standard bank account, including overdraft protection. The Company began marketing its DDA Debit Card, branded Paysign Premier Digital Bank Account, in the third quarter of 2019. The Company markets this product to a targeted portion of its existing cardholder base through existing communication points and to customers and employees of new clients.
 
Other Services
 
Customer Service Center
 
In order to provide a full range of services to our customers, we offer a fully staffed, in-house Customer Service Center which is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days per week consisting of live bilingual customer care representatives. The Paysign Platform provides Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”), SMS alerts and two-way SMS messaging, allowing cardholders to set alerts and check their balances and transaction history without the assistance of a live customer service operator. We believe our in-house customer service center provides the highest quality customer service experience for our clients as training is performed on-site by Paysign staff.
The Paysign Communications Suite
 
To help maximize the cardholder experience, cardholders can access their card balances and transaction history, as well as other information as dictated by the program, such as an ATM locator, a loyalty point counter, and geo-specific messaging through a number of touchpoints such as the Paysign kiosk, the Paysign Mobile App, two-way SMS, text alerts and the Paysign cardholder web portal.
Technology
 
Our technology platform employs a standard enterprise services bus in a service-oriented architecture, configured for 24/7/365 transaction processing and operations. We utilize two secure, interconnected, environmentally-controlled data centers, with emergency power generation capabilities, and fully redundant capabilities. We use a variety of proprietary and licensed standards-based technologies to implement our platforms, including those which provide for orchestration, interoperability and process control. The platforms also integrate a data infrastructure to support both transaction processing and data warehousing for operational support and data analytics.

Competition
 
The markets for financial products and services, including prepaid cards and services related thereto, are intensely competitive. We compete with a variety of companies in our markets and our competitors vary in size, scope and breadth of products and services offered. Certain segments of the financial services and healthcare industries tend to be highly fragmented, with numerous companies competing for market share. Highly fragmented segments currently include financial account processing, customer relationship management solutions, electronic funds transfer and prepaid solutions.
 
Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater financial strength and more recognized brands in the industry. These competitors may be able to attract customers more easily because of their financial resources and awareness in the market. Our larger competitors can also devote substantially more resources to business development and may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. To compete with these companies, we rely primarily on direct marketing strategies including strategic marketing partners.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our Paysign payment solutions through direct marketing by the Company’s sales team. Our primary market focus is on companies and municipalities that require a streamlined payment solution for rewards, rebates, payment assistance, and other payments to their customers, employees, agents and others. To reach these markets, we focus our sales efforts on direct contact with our target market and attendance at various industry specific conferences. We may, at times, utilize independent contractors who make direct sales and are paid on a commission basis only.
 
We market our Paysign Premier product through existing communication channels to a targeted segment of our existing cardholders, as well as to a broad group of individuals, ranging from non-banked to fully banked consumers with a focus on long term users of our product.
 
Markets and Major Customers
 
We have no major customers and are not reliant on any individual card program. We manage multiple programs at any given time. As of December 31, 2020, we managed approximately 360 card programs with approximately 3.5 million participating cardholders.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 
Paysign qualifies as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

· | the option to present only two years of audited financial statements and two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report on Form 10-K;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have elected to take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.

-

 

In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any time, which election is irrevocable.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion; (ii) the last day of 2024; (iii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (referred to as the Exchange Act), which would occur if the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during any three-year period.
 
Regulations
 
Introduction
 
We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. Applicable laws and regulations may change, and there is no assurance that such changes will not adversely affect our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of financial institutions we may work with. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of restrictions on activities, regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including but not limited to changes in the regulations governing banks, could have a material impact on our operations.
 
Our products and services are generally subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including:
 

· | anti-money laundering laws;
--+----------------------------


· | money transfer and payment instrument licensing regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | escheatment laws;
--+------------------


· | privacy and information safeguard laws;
--+----------------------------------------


· | bank regulations;
--+------------------


· | consumer protection laws;
--+--------------------------


· | false claims laws and other fraud and abuse restrictions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | privacy and security standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or other laws.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These laws are often evolving and sometimes ambiguous or inconsistent, and the extent to which they apply to us or the banks that issue our cards, our clients or our third party service providers is at times unclear. Any failure to comply with applicable law — either by us or by the card issuing banks, our client or our third party service providers, over which we have limited legal and practical control — could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties and the suspension or revocation of a license or registration required to sell our products and services. See "Risk Factors" for additional discussion regarding the potential impacts of changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject and failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations.
 
We continually monitor and enhance our compliance program to stay current with the most recent legal and regulatory changes. We also continue to implement policies and programs and to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current legal standards, as well as with new and changing legal requirements affecting particular services or the conduct of our business generally.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws
 
Our products and services are generally subject to federal anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, and similar state laws. On an ongoing basis, these laws require us, among other things, to:

· | report large cash transactions and suspicious activity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | screen transactions against the U.S. government's watch-lists, such as the watch-list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prevent the processing of transactions to or from certain countries, individuals, nationals and entities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | identify the dollar amounts loaded or transferred at any one time or over specified periods of time, which requires the aggregation of information over multiple transactions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | gather and, in certain circumstances, report customer information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | comply with consumer disclosure requirements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | register or obtain licenses with state and federal agencies in the United States and seek registration of any retail distributors when necessary.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Anti-money laundering regulations are constantly evolving. We continuously monitor our compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and implement policies and procedures to make our business practices flexible, so we can comply with the most current legal requirements. We cannot predict how these future regulations might affect us. Complying with future regulation could be expensive or require us to change the way we operate our business.
 
Money Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing Regulations
 
We are not currently subject to money transfer and payment instrument licensing regulations; however, we have plans to introduce products in the future that would be subject to such regulations. Currently, we believe that 39 U.S. jurisdictions would require us to obtain a license to operate a money transfer business. As a licensee, we would be subject to certain restrictions and requirements, including reporting, net worth and surety bonding requirements and requirements for regulatory approval of controlling stockholders, agent locations and consumer forms and disclosures. We would also be subject to inspection by the regulators in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed, many of which conduct regular examinations. In addition, we would be required to maintain "permissible investments" in an amount equivalent to all "outstanding payment obligations."

-

Escheatment Laws
 
Unclaimed property laws of every U.S. jurisdiction require that we track certain information on our card products and services and that, if customer funds are unclaimed at the end of an applicable statutory abandonment period, the proceeds of the unclaimed property be remitted to the appropriate jurisdiction.
Privacy and Information Safeguard Laws
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we or our third party service providers collect certain types of data, which subjects us to certain privacy and information security laws in the United States, including, for example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and other laws or rules designed to regulate consumer information and mitigate identity theft. We are also subject to privacy laws of various states. These state and federal laws impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use and disclosure of personal information, and require that financial institutions have in place policies regarding information privacy and security. In addition, under federal and certain state financial privacy laws, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies and practices for sharing nonpublic information with third parties, provide advance notice of any changes to our policies and, with limited exceptions, give consumers the right to prevent use of their nonpublic personal information and disclosure of it to unaffiliated third parties. Certain state laws may, in some circumstances, require us to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information. These laws may also require us to notify state law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data. In order to comply with the privacy and information safeguard laws, we have confidentiality/information security standards and procedures in place for our business activities and with our third-party vendors and service providers. Privacy and information security laws evolve regularly, requiring us to adjust our compliance program on an ongoing basis and presenting compliance challenges.
Bank Regulations
 
All of the cards that we service are issued by a state-chartered bank. Thus, we are subject to the oversight of the regulators for, and certain laws applicable to, these card issuing banks. These banking laws require us, as a servicer to the banks that issue our cards, among other things, to undertake compliance actions similar to those described under "Anti-Money Laundering Laws" above and to comply with the privacy regulations promulgated under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as discussed under "Privacy and Information Safeguard Laws" above.
Consumer Protection Laws
 
Certain products that we anticipate introducing in the future will likely be subject to additional state and federal consumer protection laws, including laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices, regulating electronic fund transfers and protecting consumer nonpublic information. Before we can introduce those products, we will have to develop appropriate procedures for compliance with these consumer protection laws.
Card Networks
 
In order to provide our products and services, we, as well as the banks that issue our cards, must be registered with Visa and/or MasterCard, as well as any other networks that we desire to use, such as Discover, Pulse, NYCE and Star, and, as a result, are subject to card association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card association or network for certain acts or omissions. The banks that issue our cards are specifically registered as "members" of the Visa and/or MasterCard card networks. Visa and MasterCard set the standards with which we and the card issuing banks must comply.

False Claims Laws and Other Fraud and Abuse Restrictions 
 
We provide claims processing and other transaction services to pharmaceutical companies that relate to, or directly involve, the reimbursement of pharmaceutical costs covered by Medicare, Medicaid, other federal healthcare programs and private payers. As a result of these aspects of our business, we may be subject to, or contractually required to comply with, state and federal laws that govern various aspects of the submission of healthcare claims for reimbursement and the receipt of payments for healthcare items or services. These laws generally prohibit an individual or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent. False or fraudulent claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, failing to refund known overpayments, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, improper coding and billing for medically unnecessary goods and services. Many of these laws provide significant civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance and can be enforced by private individuals through “whistleblower” or qui tam actions. To avoid liability, providers and their contractors must, among other things, carefully and accurately code, complete and submit claims for reimbursement.
 
From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry, including us, may be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or other fraud and abuse provisions. We cannot guarantee that state and federal agencies will regard any billing errors we process as inadvertent or will not hold us responsible for any compliance issues related to claims we handle on behalf of providers and payers. Although we believe our editing processes are consistent with applicable reimbursement rules and industry practice, a court, enforcement agency or whistleblower could challenge these practices. We cannot predict the impact of any enforcement actions under the various false claims and fraud and abuse laws applicable to our operations. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our practices could cause adverse publicity and cause us to incur significant legal and related costs.
 
Privacy and Security Standards under HIPAA or Other Laws.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 contains privacy regulations and the security regulations that apply to some of our operations. The privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by entities subject to HIPAA. For example, the privacy regulations permit parties to use and disclose individually identifiable health information for treatment and to process claims for payment, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. The privacy regulations also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used and disclosed. To the extent permitted by the privacy regulations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose individually identifiable health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. Determining whether data has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the privacy regulations and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. The security regulations require certain entities to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. We have implemented and maintain policies and processes to assist us in complying with the privacy regulations, the security regulations and our contractual obligations. We cannot provide assurance regarding how these standards will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. If we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, we could be subject to substantial penalties, damages and injunctive relief.
 
In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information and healthcare provider information. In addition, some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of medical records or other types of medical information. In many cases, these state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy regulations and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, the U.S. Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.

Patents and Trademarks
 
We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secrets laws.
 
In order to limit access to and disclosure of our intellectual property and proprietary information, all of our employees and consultants have signed confidentiality and we enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties. We cannot provide assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, however, will deter adequately infringement or misappropriation of those rights. Particularly given the international nature of the Internet, the rate of growth of the Internet and the ease of registering new domain names, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or proprietary information, or to take enforcement action.
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately seventy employees and independent contractors.
 
We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and believe all independent contractor and employment agreement relationships are satisfactory. We hire independent contractors on an as-needed basis, and we may retain additional employees and consultants during the next twelve months, including additional executive management personnel with substantial experience in development business.
