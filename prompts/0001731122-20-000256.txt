ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 Celexus, Inc. is an acquisition, management and holding company for early stage businesses and technologies in the hemp industry. Prior to the end of the fiscal year covered in this report, we entered into an agreement to acquire HempWave, Inc., which formerly operated as Bio Distribution, Inc. (“HempWave”). While that acquisition has not been finalized, we anticipate it will be completed in the coming months after we obtain an appraisal of HempWave.
Corporate History
 Celexus, Inc. is a Nevada incorporated corporation, originally organized on August 23, 2008. The company has been operating as Celexus, Inc. since October 2018. Prior to October 2018, the corporate entity operated under various names and business plans. Investors should only consider the company’s operations since October 2018 as relevant to the current business of the company. A detailed list of the corporate history of the company is available in our Form 10-Q filed on April 3, 2019 and available at:
 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355559/000173112219000162/e1260_form10q.htm. 
 Prior to October 2018, and within the past five years, the company was known as Telupay International, Inc., a development stage company focused on mobile banking and payment processing. Prior to this annual report, the last annual report filed for the company was submitted on July 17, 2014, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. On February 28, 2018, the company filed a Form 15 notice of termination of registration under section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company then undertook a change in majority ownership and business plan, reconstituting as Celexus, Inc., and on February 5, 2019 filing its Form 10 General Form for Registration of Securities pursuant to section 12(g) of the Securities Act of 1934.
 Business Overview
 
We are focused on the new opportunities available for the growth of hemp following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. We believe that the changes in law resulting from this legislation allow for hemp cultivation and transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. We believe that the hemp industry is ready for significant growth as a result of hemp therapeutic uses and environmental benefits and feel that this is the right time to enter this industry.
 Some observers estimate that hemp biomass has over 50,000 uses including 100% biodegradable plastic, paper, clothing, building materials, etc. Additionally, cannabidiol (“CBD”) based medicines and supplements are believed to provide many medical benefits. In particular, it has been reported that CBD has demonstrated effectiveness in treating some forms of childhood epilepsy syndromes and reducing or eliminating seizures in some patients. Others believe that CBD can treat hundreds of medical issues such as anxiety, depression, pain, arthritis, insomnia, anorexia, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, several types of cancer, Alzheimer’s, and dementia, among other medical conditions. However, medical trials are still necessary for many of these conditions.
 Hemp production also provides environmental benefits compared to traditional agricultural or forestry products. For instance, in regards to biomass for methanol, paper production, and fiberboard for construction, the average grow cycle for hemp is 12-14 weeks to fully mature at 10-15 feet tall. In contrast, a tree can take 20-50 years to reach full maturity. We believe that growth of hemp could significantly reduce deforestation by providing the same products that trees are able to supply. Further, hemp is a more efficient carbon absorbent than trees, helping to improve air quality and reducing greenhouse gas accumulation.
 We expect that more uses will be realized following new research and development that has only recently become possible after the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill. 
 Our Objective
 Our objective is to control every aspect of the hemp farming industry from seeds, to cultivation, to extraction, and to distribution. Our goal is to become a leading supplier of both hemp seeds and clones internationally. We aim to do this by undertaking strategic acquisitions of companies that will be wholly-owned operating subsidiaries of Celexus, Inc. Our business plan includes three-stages for these acquisitions. We intend to acquire:

1. | Landholding entities for the cultivation of high grade, certified hemp seeds and clones. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Processing facilities to dry biomass, extract hemp oil and refine to pharmaceutical grade CBD oils. 
3. | Wholesale distribution services for domestic and international distribution of hemp products.

Seeds and Clones Products
 As part of stage one, we intend to acquire state law compliant entities that will be able to cultivate help and produce seeds and clones for other cultivators.
 Finding quality seeds in the current hemp market has proven difficult for many growers. Low quality seeds are suitable for biomass and products derived from hemp fiber, but higher quality seeds are necessary for higher-value CBD production. These higher quality seeds are typically bio-engineered and protected by patents. As a result, cultivators will need to repurchase seeds every grow cycle. A typical CBD hemp farm will grow between 1,500 to 2,500 plants per acre. This requires approximately 2,500 to 3,500 seeds per acre per growth cycle since all seeds will not germinate.
 Clones are clippings from another hemp plant that can be planted and grown into new plants. There are three main benefits to growing clones over seeds.
 
1. | Faster growth cycles because the plant is already several inches tall;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | A clone copies the exact genetic makeup of the plant it was clipped from, reducing the risk of genetic issues; and
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Guaranteed plants in contrast to seed cultivation because some seeds do not sprout.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clones, however, are costlier per plant than seeds, which can reduce the demand for such products. With clones, there is also the risk that plants will carry over any disease or infection from the original plant. To mitigate this risk and to generate the highest quality product possible, we intend to grow out plants indoors and under constant supervision from our master growers.
 Exchange Agreement
 In February 2019, the Company signed an exchange agreement (“Agreement”) with HempWave, Inc., a company in common control of Lisa Averbuch our CFO and Director. We have targeted HempWave, Inc., as it is currently operating in the hemp industry and is farming high quality hemp in Arizona and as such we believe that it would be a great addition to our Company and would allow us to further achieve our business objectives. We expect the proposed HempWave acquisition to be a key part of establishing the company as a leader in the hemp industry. The acquisition agreement that was executed in February 2019, is expected to be fully consummated by May 31, 2020 or sooner, providing all due diligence and market analysis confirms that moving forward will be beneficial to the company and its shareholders.
 The Agreement entails that the Company will acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of HempWave (formerly Bio Distribution, Inc.) in exchange for $13,000,000 worth of common stock of the Company based on a fair market appraisal valuation and $1. The Company desires this exchange to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. There is a 90 day due diligence period in the Agreement during which time either party may terminate the Agreement without further liability.
 Termination
 This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time of the Exchange:
 (a)   by mutual written consent of CELE and the Company;
 (b)  by either CELE or the Company if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Exchange and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;
 (c)   by either CELE or the Company if the Exchange shall not have been consummated on or before July 31, 2018 (other than as a result of the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Effective Time.);
 (d)  by CELE, if a material adverse change shall have occurred relative to the Company (and not curable within thirty (30) days);
 (e)   by the Company if a material adverse change shall have occurred relative to CELE (and not curable within thirty (30) days);
 (f)   by CELE, if the Company willfully fails to perform in any material respect any of its material obligations under this Agreement; or
 (g)  by the Company, if CELE willfully fails to perform in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement.
 Extension; Waiver
 Subject to Section 6.01(c), at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.
 The foregoing descriptions of the Exchange Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of such agreements, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 on our Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively, each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 HempWave has acquired a bio-engineered strain of hemp seeds that produce low Tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) levels, to meet industry regulations, and a high CBD content, which is ideal for CBD products. HempWave will begin cultivation operations in two greenhouse facilities based in Phoenix and Willcox, Arizona, which have a combined total of over 210,000 square feet of arable land. The greenhouse facilities include agricultural lighting, drip systems, storage areas, and sufficient water rights.
 We believe HempWave is a suitable acquisition target. In addition to its current strains and growing space, HempWave has received all five industrial hemp licenses issued by the State of Arizona. The licenses include:
 
Nursery License —allows
the licensee to propagate eligible seed and propagative materials for planting for a licensed grower. A licensed nursery may not
grow industrial hemp for harvesting purposes, unless also licensed as a grower.
Grower License —allows
the licensee to: 1) obtain seed or propagative materials for planting; 2) possess authorized seed and/or propagative materials
for planting; 3) cultivate hemp; 4) harvest hemp; 5) possess and store harvested hemp; and 6) transport harvested hemp for processing.
Harvester License —allows
the licensee to harvest an eligible industrial hemp crop for a licensed grower.
Transporter License —allows
the licensee to transport a harvested industrial hemp crop for a licensed grower.
Processor License
—allows the licensee to: 1) engage in the processing, handling, and storage of industrial hemp or hemp seed at one or more
authorized locations in the state; and 2) sell, distribute, transfer, or gift any products processed from harvested hemp that is
not restricted by rule or law.

 The Company is heavily regulated including licensing as noted above and federal and state law. The Farm Bill of 2018 eliminated much of that regulation by removing Hemp as a federally banned substance.

Hemp Industry Regulations 
 
Our business is dependent on laws pertaining to the Hemp industry, while the industry faces strong opposition the regulations have begun to change in the favor of the company. With the Farm Bill of 2018, industrial Hemp is now legal on a federal level therefore much easier to manage and run the daily operations on a national scale. 
 
The 2018 Farm Bill allows for the interstate sale and transfer of hemp-derived products for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. The Farm Bill ensures that any cannabinoid—components of CBD —that is derived from hemp will be legal, if that hemp is produced in a manner consistent with the Farm Bill, associated federal regulations, associated state regulations, and by a licensed grower as defined in the Farm Bill.
 
As more regulations begin to take shape, it is the belief of the company that the operations of the business on an administrative level will become less cumbersome and help to stream line the speed of implementing new products, procedures and strategic partnerships.
 
Employees
 As of June 1, 2019, we have one full time employee with Celexus, Inc, our President, David Soto, who is engaged as a contractor.
