General
  
Duonas Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 19, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of June 30. We have $12,077 revenues, have incurred losses since inception. We are a company formed to commence operations concerned with production of decor pieces and living accessories made from concrete, such as: different sculptures, bookends, candle holders, billets for clocks, vases of different shapes and forms, planters; and subsequent selling thereof. As of today, we have developed our business plan and executed an Office Lease Agreement, dated May 17, 2016 and Equipment Purchase Agreement, dated May 10, 2016. Our office is located at str. Osijek 50, Rijeka, Primorje-Gorski Kotar, Croatia, 51000. Our telephone number is 38551215704.
Our Business
  
The newcomer design label comes forth with a new, fresh product line in pieces of decor and living accessories. The strength of these products lies in their clarity, their apparent stability and sophisticated simplicity. Elaborately handcrafted, the gray mass transforms into pruritic geometric solids: vase, candleholder, planter, which are delicate, unobtrusive, reduced, and essential.
  
The components such as sand, cement and water are as simple and unobtrusive as the end result. In its conventional use and application, concrete is often monumental, immense and imposing. During the course of complex work steps, we turn this grey mass into pruritic, geometric living accessories and pieces of decor.
  
We plan to commence operations in production of decor pieces and living accessories made from concrete, such as: different sculptures, bookends, candle holders, billets for clocks, vases of different shapes and forms, planters; and subsequent selling thereof. In the next 12 months after completion of our offering we intend to offer our services to clients in Croatia. 
  
We are working with small items (e.g. candle holders or vases); we plan to create high quality decorations for the house, for the office and for the backyard in future. Our items can be used for design, decoration and planning necessary space. Mr. Beinars will perform our design services. We anticipate that our potential clients or client agencies will execute contracts with us regarding our services in decorative field. We are going to work with wide range of clients from usual family, which wants to make their home and office look cozier, to interior designers, who want to please and satisfy their clients. Concrete is a versatile material and it is easy to make different decorative items from it. Such items can made simple things look more original.
  
We intend to provide several basic types of items:
 ·        Decorative sculptures;
 ·        Bookends;
 ·        Candle holders;
 ·        Billets for clocks
 ·        Vases;
 ·        Planters;
  
We plan to offer different items to help our client decorate their homes and offices to make them look original and cozier. By our philosophy, it is very important to suggest our clients the professional vision of decoration of living areas and working where they will spend their daily live. In the future our clients will have an ability to choose any product they like from our website (www.duonascorp.com). We will finish goods and we want to sale them via our website.

Potential clients
  
We plan to commence operations in decorative field and to be responsible for the concept decorative vision of homes and offices of our clients. Our potential clients will include interior designers, home renovators and homeowners. We intend to participate in local and national interior decor competition in order to take part in significant projects and spread the business in Croatia and other countries when and if we have funds available to expand our business.
  
Competition and potential customers 
  
Winning customers will be critical to our ability to grow our business. We are a new and un-established company, have a weak competitive position in the industry and have $12,077 revenues. Accumulated deficit was $7,108 as of June 30, 2017. We need capital to carry out our current business plan. We also anticipate that we will require additional financing in order to execute our business plan. We may not have sufficient financing to sustain our current operations. Our sole officer and director, Vladyslav Beinars, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to sustain our current operations. However, Mr. Beinars has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Many of the companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. It is uncertain whether services offered by us will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance.
  
The market competition of Croatia can be evaluated as a high. There are several large well-established companies, which provide similar service: Industrial Republic and Iklarica. That is why we plan to concentrate in small and middle-scale sized items. Our competitors include all interior decor service in residential design throughout Croatia. In order to be more or less successful in the existing stiff condition we will provide a new vision of modern houses’ decorations which are characterized by using unusual materials, environment friendly technologies and out of the ordinary appearance. Also we will make competitive price for our work in order to get more clients.
  
Duoans Corp. is going to cooperate with many companies. Some of them are direct manufacturers of furniture for the home and garden. Such companies often seek the help of scenery objects. Some of them are – “Eko-linija” and “Cadoro namjeљtaj”. In addition, we are going to be exhibited in other stores of our partners, like a “MojEnterijer” and “Marketcentar”.  We will use also the opportunity to be exposed in large shopping malls such as “Namjestaj-intermod”, “UrediSvojDom” and “Ikea”.
  
Duonas Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many participants in the business of providing decorative services. Many established, yet well financed entities are currently active in the business of providing such services. Nearly all Duonas Corp.’s competitors have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than us. We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in being able to provide such services and become a successful company in the interior decor industry. Therefore, Duonas Corp. may not be able to establish itself within the industry at all.
  
Marketing
  
Our sole officer and director, Vladyslav Beinars, will be responsible for marketing of our services. The marketing and advertising will be targeted to small businesses, interior designers, home renovators, homeowners and various sectors, which have need of interior decor. Our methods of communication will include: phone calls, email, and regular mail. We will ask our satisfied clients for referrals. We will also promote our services through word of mouth. We will be targeting clients in Croatia. We plan to develop a website to market, display and sell our services. One of the most powerful aspects of online marketing is the ability to target our chosen group with a high degree of accuracy and cost effective way. We have plans to hire marketing company which will help us to use the following online marketing tools to direct traffic to our website and identify potential:
  
Banner advertising:  New technologies have given to online advertisement customization capabilities when it comes to banner advertising. Advertisers now have the ability to have their  banner ads appear on pages devoted to certain types of content. We can have our ad appear on a site only when it is presenting an article on the decor industry. 
 Organic Search:  The remainder of the search results page is made up of organic or “natural” search results. These listings are generated based on the HTML tags and relevant content found  in a website. By specifically tailoring these elements, we can focus on particular audiences in a similar fashion as Pay-Per-Click.
  
As of the date of this prospectus we have registered domain name for our website (www.duonascorp.com). To accomplish this, we plan to contract an independent web designing company. Our website describes our advantages, show our contact information, and include some general information. We intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics mentioned above. We intend to promote our website by displaying it on our promotion materials. We will also promote our services through word of mouth and use internet promotion tools on Facebook, MySpace and Twitter to advertise our company and create links to our website. To enhance advertising of our services we plan to keep improving and developing our website to make it as “user friendly” as possible.

Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of customers using our services, there is no guarantee that it will cover our costs and that we will be able retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed.
  
Contracts
  
We have executed an Office Lease Agreement with Branko Markos, dated May 19, 2016. According to the agreement, Duonas Corp. leases an office for the production of decor pieces and living accessories. Also we have executed an Equipment Purchase Agreement with Zhengzhou Xinyu Machinery Co., Ltd.. According to the agreement, Duonas Corp. purchased equipment and raw materials for the production of decor pieces and living accessories. We have executed a Verbal Agreement with our sole officer and director Vladyslav Beinars. According to agreement President has verbally agreed to loan to the Company needed funds, which can be deemed for the purpose of the Corporation’s needs. We have signed two contracts with our customers Decoric Ltd. and HouseDec Ltd. The total amount of sales to Decoric Ltd. was $7,270 and HouseDec Ltd. $4,807.
Insurance
  
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Employees
  
We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer, Vladyslav Beinars.

Our office is located at str. Osijek 50, Rijeka, Primorje-Gorski Kotar, Croatia, 51000. Our phone number is 38551215704.
