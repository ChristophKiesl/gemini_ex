ITEM 1.          BUSINESS

Unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms “Havertys," "we," "our," or "us" when referring to the consolidated operations of Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc. and subsidiary.

Overview

Havertys is a specialty retailer of residential furniture and accessories. Our founder, J.J. Haverty began the business in 1885 in Atlanta, Georgia with one store and made deliveries using horse-drawn wagons. The Company grew to 18 stores and was incorporated in September 1929. Anticipating further growth, the Company accessed additional capital through its initial public offering in October 1929.

Havertys has grown to 120 stores in 16 states in the Southern and Midwest regions. All of our retail locations are operated using the Havertys name and we do not franchise our stores. Our customers are generally college educated women in middle to upper-middle income households. Our brand recognition is very high in the markets we serve, and consumer surveys indicate Havertys is associated with a high level of quality, fashion, value, and service.

Merchandise and Revenues

We develop our merchandise selection with the tastes of the diverse “on trend” consumer in mind. A wide range of styles from traditional to contemporary are in our core assortment and virtually all of the furniture merchandise we carry bears the Havertys brand. We also tailor our product offerings to the needs and tastes of the local markets we serve emphasizing more “coastal,” “western” or “urban” looks as appropriate. Our custom upholstery programs and eclectic looks are an important part of our product mix and allow the on-trend consumer more self-expression.

We have avoided offering lower quality, promotional price-driven merchandise favored by many regional and national chains, which we believe would devalue the Havertys brand with the consumer. We carry nationally well-known mattress product lines such as Tempur-Pedic®, Serta® and Sealy® in addition to our private label SkyeTM.

Our customers use varying methods to purchase or finance their sales. As an added convenience to our customers, we offer financing by third-party finance companies. Sales financed by the third-party providers are not Havertys’ receivables; accordingly, we do not have any credit risk or servicing responsibility for these accounts, and there is no credit or collection recourse to Havertys. Slightly less than one-third of our sales are third-party financed. The fees we pay to the third-party are included in our selling, general, and expenses (“SG&A”) as a selling expense.

Stores

As of December 31, 2020, we operated 120 stores serving 84 cities in 16 states with approximately 4.4 million retail square feet. Our stores range in size from 19,000 to 60,000 selling square feet with the average being approximately 35,000 square feet. We strive to have our stores reflect the distinctive style and comfort consumers expect to find when purchasing their home furnishings. The store’s location and curb appeal are important to the middle to upper-middle income consumer that we target, and attractive facades complement the quality and style of our merchandise. Interior details are also important for a pleasant and inviting shopping experience. We are very intentional in having open shopping spaces and our disciplined merchandise display ensures uniformity of presentations in-store, online and in our advertising.

We currently have no plans to expand outside our distribution footprint and there are a limited number of markets that we do not currently serve that are expansion candidates.  We are evaluating certain existing stores for relocation or closure. We do not expect a significant increase in our retail square footage in 2021.

 
Online Presence

We consider our website an extension of our brick-and-mortar locations and not a separate segment of our business. Most customers will use the internet for inspiration and as a start to their shopping process to view products and prices. Our website features a variety of helpful tools including a design center with room planners, upholstery customization, and inspired accessories to create shareable “Idea Boards.” A large number of product reviews written by our customers are also provided, which some consumers find important in the decision-making process.

The next stop in the purchase journey for most consumers is a visit to a store to touch, sit, and see merchandise in person. Our sales consultants also use havertys.com as a tool to further engage our customers while they are in the store. They may make their purchase in the store or opt to return home and finalize their decisions, place their orders online and set delivery. We limit online sales of our furniture to within our delivery network, and accessories to the continental United States.

Our website traffic, as expected, increased dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic as people spent more time in their homes and were reluctant or not able to shop in our stores. During April when our stores were closed, we reassigned a number of our store personnel to serve as online chat agents and our in-home designers shifted to virtual visits. Once our stores reopened, we continued to see a rise in the completion of the sales process online. Our total sales completed online for 2020 increased 65% over 2019 and were approximately 4.4% of our total 2020 sales. This level of sales makes our website our highest performing “store.”

We believe offering a direct-to-customer business complements our retail store operations as we serve the customer in the method of their choosing and leverage the power of high touch service and online capabilities.

Competition

The retail sale of home furnishings is a highly fragmented and competitive business. There has been growth in the e‑commerce channel both from internet only retailers and those with a brick-and-mortar presence. The degree and sources of brick-and-mortar retail competition varies by geographic area. We compete with numerous individual retail furniture stores as well as national and regional chains. Retail stores opened or operated by furniture manufacturers in an effort to control and protect the distribution prospects of their branded merchandise compete with us in certain markets.  Mass merchants, certain department stores, and some electronics and appliance retailers also have limited furniture product offerings.

We believe Havertys is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, with a targeted mix of merchandise that appeals to customers who are somewhat more affluent than those of promotional price-oriented furniture stores. Our online presence provides most elements of a seamless, omni-channel approach that many of our competitors do not have or cannot replicate. We consider the expansion of our custom order capabilities, free in-home design service, the tailoring of merchandise on a local market basis, and the ability to make prompt delivery of orders through maintenance of inventory, significant competitive advantages.

Suppliers and Supply Chain

We buy our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, the largest ten of which accounted for approximately 45% of our product purchases during 2020. Most of our wood products, or “case goods,” are imported from Asia. Upholstered items are largely produced domestically, with the exception of our leather products which are primarily imported from Asia or Mexico.

We purchase our furniture merchandise produced in Asia through sourcing companies and also buy direct from manufacturers. We have dedicated quality control specialists on-site during production to ensure the items meet our specifications. Our direct import team works with industry designers and manufacturers in some of the best factories throughout Asia. Approximately 17% of our case goods sales and 8% of our upholstery sales in 2020 were generated by our direct imports.

 
The longer lead times required for deliveries from overseas factories and the production of merchandise exclusively for Havertys makes it imperative for us to have both warehousing capabilities and end-to-end supply chain visibility. Our merchandising team provides input to the automated procurement process in an effort to maintain overall inventory levels within an appropriate range and reduce the number of written sales awaiting product delivery. We use real-time information to closely follow our import orders from the manufacturing plant through each stage of transit and using this data can more accurately set customer delivery dates prior to receipt of product.

Demand created by the "nesting" response generated by COVID-19 is outpacing product availability in certain categories. Manufacturers are challenged to ensure safe work environments and have encountered some raw material shortages. Product manufactured in Asia is also impacted by shipping capacity. We believe that the current volatility in our supply chain will improve by the third quarter of 2021.

Distribution

We believe that our distribution and delivery system is one of the best in the retail furniture industry and provides us with a significant competitive advantage. Our distribution system uses a combination of three distribution centers (“DCs”) and four home delivery centers (“HDCs”). The DCs receive both domestic product and containers of imported merchandise. A warehousing management system using radio frequency scanners tracks each piece of inventory in real time and allows for random storage in the warehouse and efficient scheduling and changing of the workflow. The DCs are also designed to shuttle prepped merchandise up to 250 miles for next day home deliveries and serve HDCs within a 500-mile radius. The HDCs provide service to markets within an additional 200 miles. We use a third-party to handle over-the-road delivery of product from the DCs to the HDCs and market areas. We use Havertys team members for executing home delivery, and have branded this service “Top Drawer Delivery,” an important function serving as the last contact with our customers in the purchase process. Operating standards in our warehouse and delivery functions provide measurements for determining staffing needs and increasing productivity.

When we restarted our operations after a six-week pause we had reduced delivery capacity due to fewer personnel. Time between purchase and delivery moved from our normal 3 to 5 days to as much as 3 to 5 weeks when inventory and associate shortages were most acute. Purchases made at the end of 2020 of in-stock product were delivered within 1 to 2 weeks as we have added additional team members, but for certain merchandise, delivery times can be up to 12 weeks.


 
Seasonality

Our business is affected by traditional retail seasonality, advertising and promotion programs, and general economic trends.  We typically achieve our smallest quarter by revenues in the second quarter and the largest in the fourth quarter. The “nesting” response generated by COVID-19 created outsized demand beginning in the second quarter of 2020. In 2018, our fourth quarter sales did not match historical patterns as business surrounding the traditional holiday shopping periods around Thanksgiving and Christmas was significantly lower than in the prior years.
Human Capital Resources

 As of December 31, 2020, Havertys’ total workforce was 2,766: 1,534 in our retail store operations, 992 in our warehouse and delivery points, 173 in our corporate operations, and 67 in our customer-service call centers. None of our team members is a party to a union contract. See Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Impact of COVID-19 for more information.
Health and Safety
 We were a leader in our industry as we closed our retail stores and paused distribution operations in mid-March to help protect the health and safety of our team members. Since reopening in May, we are carefully following CDC guidelines and have established a number of safety protocols, including face covering and physical distance requirements, enhanced cleaning, encouraging daily self-health checks, voluntary temperature screening stations, and access to virtual primary care physicians at no cost. We also have a multi-disciplinary team coordinating responses to COVID-19 tests due to illness or exposure and positive COVID-19 tests. As part of that process, we have developed a robust contact tracing program to identify team members who were in close contact with an ill colleague in the workplace.

We care about our teammates, customers, and the communities we serve. We have a strong safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs to ensure our team members can leave their job and return home safely, every day. This focus has resulted in a reduction of our frequency of injury claims of 43.4% over five years (2016 – 2020) and our self-insured loss rates are down 38.2% over the same period. This commitment and focus have enabled us to restart our business operations without sacrificing the safety of our teammates and customers.

Diversity
 Integrity and teamwork are two of our core values. These drive our approach in our everyday operations with our customers, suppliers and teammates and we believe that the best results happen when we work together. At Havertys, we see strength in America's many faces, cultures, and colors. Each person offers a unique point of view and presents a fresh perspective. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work.
Retention
 Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain, and motivate team members to achieve superior results. Havertys’ total compensation for teammates includes a variety of components including competitive pay consistent with positions, skill levels, experience, and knowledge. We also offer competitive benefits, including access to healthcare plans, financial and physical wellness programs, paid time off, parental leave and retirement benefits.

We are committed to supporting our teammates’ continuous development of professional, technical and leadership skills through corporate training programs, access to digital learning resources and through partnerships with local technical learning institutions. In 2020, Havertys team members consumed approximately 119,000 hours of learning. We also offer the ability for team members to pursue degree programs, professional certificates, and individual courses in strategic fields of study through our tuition reimbursement program.

 
Trademarks and Domain Names

We have registered our various logos, trademarks and service marks. We believe that our trademark position is adequately protected in all markets in which we do business. In addition, we have registered and maintain numerous internet domain names including “havertys.com.” Collectively, the logos, trademarks, service marks and domain names that we hold are of material importance to us.
