Item 1.Business
Overview
SunCoke Energy, Inc. (“SunCoke Energy,” “SunCoke,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us”) is the largest independent producer of high-quality coke in the Americas, as measured by tons of coke produced each year, and has more than 60 years of coke production experience. Coke is a principal raw material in the blast furnace steelmaking process and is produced by heating metallurgical coal in a refractory oven, which releases certain volatile components from the coal, thus transforming the coal into coke. We also own and operate a logistics business that provides handling and/or mixing services to steel, coke (including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities), electric utility, coal producing and other manufacturing based customers. 
Incorporated in Delaware since 2010 and headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, we became a publicly-traded company in 2011 and our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “SXC.”
Cokemaking Operations
We are a technological leader in cokemaking. We have designed, developed, built, own and operate five cokemaking facilities in the United States (“U.S.”) with collective nameplate capacity to produce approximately 4.2 million tons of blast furnace coke per year. Additionally, we have designed and operate one cokemaking facility in Brazil under licensing and operating agreements on behalf of ArcelorMittal Brasil S.A. ("ArcelorMittal Brazil”), which has approximately 1.7 million tons of annual cokemaking capacity. Our cokemaking ovens utilize efficient, modern heat recovery technology designed to combust the coal’s volatile components liberated during the cokemaking process and use the resulting heat to create steam or electricity for sale. This differs from by-product cokemaking, which repurposes the coal’s liberated volatile components for other uses. We have constructed the only greenfield cokemaking facilities in the U.S. in approximately 30 years and are the only North American coke producer that utilizes heat recovery technology in the cokemaking process. To diversify our business and customer base, SunCoke began exploring the foundry coke market in 2020. Foundry coke is a high-quality grade of coke that is used at foundries to melt iron and various metals in cupola furnaces, which is further processed via casting or molding into products used in various industries such as construction, transportation and industrial products. Throughout 2020, we tested production capacity and executed successful test sales of foundry coke. We will begin to produce and sell foundry coke on a commercial scale in 2021, but not at a level that will be material to our operations. Therefore, the discussion that follows is specific to blast furnace coke ("coke"), our main operation.
We believe our advanced heat recovery cokemaking process has numerous advantages over by-product cokemaking, including producing higher quality coke, using waste heat to generate derivative energy for resale and reducing the environmental impact. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 specifically directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to evaluate our heat recovery coke oven technology as a basis for establishing Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for new cokemaking facilities. In addition, each of the four cokemaking facilities that we have built since 1990 has either met or exceeded the applicable Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”), or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (“LAER”) standards, as applicable, set forth by the EPA for cokemaking facilities at that time. 
Our Granite City facility and the first phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill I, have steam generation facilities, which use hot flue gas from the cokemaking process to produce steam for sale to customers pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements. Granite City sells steam to United States Steel Corporation ("U.S. Steel") and Haverhill I provides steam, at minimal cost, to Altivia Petrochemicals, LLC. Our Middletown facility and the second phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill II, have cogeneration plants that use the hot flue gas created by the cokemaking process to generate electricity, which either is sold into the regional power market or to Cleveland-Cliffs Steel Holding Corporation pursuant to energy sales agreements. 
Our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities. We direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces. Substantially all of our coke sales are made pursuant to long-term, take-or-pay agreements, which require us to produce the contracted volumes of coke and require our customers to purchase such volumes of coke up to a specified tonnage or pay the contract price for any tonnage they elect not to take. As a result, our ability to produce the contracted coke volume is a key determinant of our profitability. Our domestic capacity is largely consumed by long-term contracts. With the exception of 400 thousand tons in 2021 and 800 thousand tons in 2022, our 4.2 million tons of domestic cokemaking capacity will be produced under long-term contracts. Accordingly, spot prices for coke do not significantly affect our revenues.

Historically, substantially all of our coke sales were made under long-term, take-or-pay agreements with three primary customers in the U.S.: ArcelorMittal USA LLC ("AM USA"), AK Steel Holding Corporation ("AK Steel") and United States Steel Corporation ("U.S. Steel"), each of which individually accounted for greater than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. In March 2020, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. ("Cliffs"), a leading producer of iron ore pellets, completed the acquisition of AK Steel, and subsequently changed the name of AK Steel to Cleveland-Cliffs Steel Holding Corporation. In December 2020, Cliffs completed the acquisition of AM USA, and subsequently changed the name of AM USA to Cleveland-Cliffs Steel LLC. Collectively, we refer to Cleveland-Cliffs Steel Holding Corporation and Cleveland-Cliffs Steel LLC as "Cliffs Steel." 
Our contracts with each entity were not impacted by the transactions that occurred in 2020. Contracts with Cliffs Steel are expected to account for approximately 75 percent of our domestic cokemaking capacity in 2021 and approximately 65 percent of our domestic cokemaking capacity in 2022. 
The following table sets forth information about our cokemaking facilities:

(1)Cokemaking nameplate capacity represents stated capacity for production of blast furnace coke. The minimum tons in our coke sales agreements may be lower than the annual cokemaking nameplate capacity. 
(2)The Middletown coke sales agreement provides for coke sales on a “run of oven” basis, which includes both blast furnace coke and small coke. Middletown nameplate capacity on a “run of oven” basis is 578 thousand tons per year.
(3)In July 2020, the Jewell and Haverhill I contracts with AM USA, now known as Cliffs Steel, were amended to extend the contract expiration date from December 2020 to December 2025. Under the contract amendments, Jewell and Haverhill I will supply a combined 800 thousand tons for the 2021 contract year and a combined 400 thousand tons annually for the 2022 through 2025 contract years. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion on contract amendments. Each facility will continue to operate at full capacity. The remaining capacity from Jewell and Haverhill I is expected to be sold into the spot market and/or the foundry coke market. 
(4)In July 2020, the Haverhill II contract with Cliffs Steel was amended to extend the contract expiration date from December 2021 to June 2023. In October 2020, the contract expiration date was further extended to June 2025. The energy supply agreement, whereby Cliffs Steel purchases electricity produced from the Haverhill II cogeneration plant, will expire in December 2021. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion on contract amendments. 
Our coke sales agreements contain pass-through provisions for costs we incur in the cokemaking process, including coal and coal procurement costs, subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields, operating and maintenance expenses, 
costs related to the transportation of coke to our customers, taxes (other than income taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation. When targeted coal-to-coke yields are achieved, the price of coal is not a significant determining factor in the profitability of these facilities, although it does affect our revenue and cost of sales for these facilities in approximately equal amounts. However, to the extent that the actual coal-to-coke yields are less than the contractual standard, we are responsible for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process. Conversely, to the extent our actual coal-to-coke yields are higher than the contractual standard, we realize gains. As coal prices increase, the benefits associated with favorable coal-to-coke yields also increase. These features of our coke sales agreements reduce our exposure to variability in coal price changes and inflationary costs over the remaining terms of these agreements. The coal component of the Jewell coke price is typically fixed annually for each calendar year based on the weighted-average contract price of third-party coal purchases at our Haverhill facility applicable to Cliffs Steel coke sales.
Our coke prices include both an operating cost component and a fixed fee component. Operating costs under two of our coke sales agreements are fixed subject to an annual adjustment based on an inflation index. Under our other four coke sales agreements, operating costs are passed through to the respective customers subject to an annually negotiated budget, in some cases subject to a cap annually adjusted for inflation, and we share any difference in costs from the budgeted amounts with our customers. Accordingly, actual operating costs in excess of caps or budgets can have a significant impact on the profitability of all of our domestic cokemaking facilities. The fixed fee component for each ton of coke sold to the customer is determined at the time the coke sales agreement is signed and is effective for the term of each sales agreement. The fixed fee is intended to provide an adequate return on invested capital and may differ based on investment levels and other considerations. The actual return on invested capital at any facility is based on the fixed fee per ton and favorable or unfavorable performance on pass-through cost items. 
Steelmaking customers faced significant challenges earlier in the year resulting from the novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19"). In response to the decline in end user demand, as well as in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, in March 2020, end user manufacturers began idling plants, which directly and adversely impacted our customers. As a result, the U.S. steel production utilization rate declined approximately 25 percent during the first half of 2020 from a stable 80 percent in December 2019 to 55 percent as of June 30, 2020. In order to help navigate through this challenging environment, SunCoke worked with our customers to provide near-term coke supply relief for customers in exchange for extending certain contracts. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further detail. In the second half of 2020, demand and capacity utilization in the U.S. steel industry largely recovered from the impacts of COVID-19 as many of the temporarily idled blast furnaces restarted, resulting in a U.S. steel production utilization rate of 75 percent as of January 2021. We expect continued recovery of U.S. steel production utilization rates in 2021. 
Our Brazil cokemaking operations are located in Vitória, Brazil, where we operate our ArcelorMittal Brazil cokemaking facility for a Brazilian subsidiary of ArcelorMittal S.A. Revenues from our Brazilian cokemaking facility are derived from licensing and operating fees, which include a fixed annual licensing fee, a licensing fee based upon the level of production required by our customer and full pass-through of the operating costs of the facility. 
Logistics Operations 
Our logistics business consists of Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT"), Kanawha River Terminal ("KRT"), Lake Terminal and Dismal River Terminal (“DRT”). CMT is located in Convent, Louisiana, with strategic access to seaborne markets for coal and other industrial materials. The terminal provides loading and unloading services and has direct rail access and the current capability to transload 15 million tons annually with its top of the line ship loader. The facility serves coal mining customers as well as other merchant business, including aggregates (crushed stone) and petroleum coke. CMT's efficient barge unloading capabilities complement its rail and truck offerings and provide the terminal with the ability to transload and mix a significantly broader variety of materials, including coal, petroleum coke and other materials from barges at its dock. KRT is a leading metallurgical and thermal coal mixing and handling terminal service provider with collective capacity to mix and transload 25 million tons annually through its operations in Ceredo and Belle, West Virginia. Lake Terminal and DRT provide coal handling and mixing services to SunCoke's Indiana Harbor and Jewell cokemaking operations, respectively. 
Our logistics business has the collective capacity to mix and/or transload more than 40 million tons of coal and other aggregates annually and has storage capacity of approximately 3 million tons. Our terminals act as intermediaries between our customers and end users by providing transloading and mixing services. Materials are transported in numerous ways, including rail, truck, barge or ship. We do not take possession of materials handled but instead derive our revenues by providing handling and/or mixing services to our customers on a per ton basis. Revenues are recognized when services are provided as defined by customer contracts. Logistics services provided to our domestic cokemaking facilities are provided under contracts with terms equivalent to those of arm's-length transactions.
Certain CMT customers are impacted by seaborne export market dynamics. Fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest Europe, as referenced in the Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index Report ("API2 index price"), as well as Newcastle index coal prices, as referenced in the Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index ("API6 index price"), which reflect low-ash coal prices shipped from Australia, contribute to our customers' decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through CMT. API2 and API6 prices declined during the first half of 2020, driven by tempered demand from Europe and increasing Russian coal supply, unfavorably impacting export volumes from our customers. During the fourth quarter, the coal export market showed signs of recovery, as reflected by an increase in API2 prices of 15 percent and an increase in Gulf Coast thermal coal export volumes of approximately 70 percent. The API2 forward curve projections indicate continued recovery of the coal export market, and we expect between 4 million and 5 million tons of coal to be exported from CMT in 2021. 
Our KRT terminals serve two primary domestic markets, metallurgical coal trade and thermal coal trade. Metallurgical markets are primarily impacted by steel prices and blast furnace operating levels whereas thermal markets are impacted by natural gas prices and electricity demand. Challenging market conditions impacted the volume of coal moving through our domestic logistics terminals in 2020, including the terminals that serve our own cokemaking facilities, as a result of the volume relief provided to our Domestic Coke customers. In 2021, we expect our cokemaking facilities to operate at full capacity. Therefore, we expect throughput volumes at our domestic logistics terminals to increase to approximately 10 million tons, up from approximately 9 million tons in 2020. Volumes from third party customers in 2021 are expected to be consistent with 2020. 
A significant portion of our logistics business has historically been from long-term, take-or-pay contracts with Murray American Coal, Inc. ("Murray") and Foresight Energy LLC ("Foresight"), which were adversely impacted by declining coal export prices and domestic demand. Murray filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 29, 2019. Foresight engaged outside counsel and financial advisors to assess restructuring options during 2019 and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 10, 2020. Both the Murray and Foresight contracts with CMT were subsequently rejected by the bankruptcy courts. CMT began handling tons in 2020 under an agreement with Javelin Global Commodities (UK) Ltd (“Javelin”), the global coal trading and marketing agent for Foresight and others. In December 2020, CMT entered into a long-term, take-or-pay agreement with Javelin, which includes 4 million tons in 2021 and 3 million tons in 2022. 
Seasonality
Our revenues in our cokemaking business are tied to long-term, take-or-pay contracts and as such, are not seasonal. However, our cokemaking profitability is tied to coal-to-coke yields, which improve in drier weather.  Accordingly, the coal-to-coke yield component of our profitability tends to be more favorable in the third quarter. Extreme weather may also challenge our operating costs and production in the winter months for our domestic coke business. KRT service demand fluctuates due to changes in the domestic electricity markets. Excessively hot summer weather or cold winter weather may increase commercial and residential needs for heat or air conditioning, which in turn may increase electricity usage and the demand for thermal coal and, therefore, may favorably impact our logistics business. Additionally, operating costs at CMT are impacted by water levels on the Mississippi River, which are often higher in the spring months. 
Raw Materials
Metallurgical coal is the principal raw material for our cokemaking operations. All of the metallurgical coal used to produce coke at our domestic cokemaking facilities is purchased from third-parties. We believe there is an adequate supply of metallurgical coal available in the U.S. and worldwide, and we have been able to supply coal to our domestic cokemaking facilities without any significant disruption in coke production.
Each ton of coke produced at our facilities requires approximately 1.4 tons of metallurgical coal. We purchased 5.4 million tons of metallurgical coal in 2020. Metallurgical coal is generally purchased on an annual basis via one-year contracts with costs passed through to our customers in accordance with the applicable coke sales agreements. Occasionally, shortfalls in deliveries by metallurgical coal suppliers require us to procure supplemental coal volumes. As with typical annual purchases, the cost of these supplemental purchases is also generally passed through to our customers. In 2021, our metallurgical coal contracts are based on coke production requirements and do not contain a minimum annual purchase requirement. Most metallurgical coal procurement decisions are made through a coal committee structure with customer participation. The customer can generally exercise an overriding vote on most coal procurement decisions.
Transportation and Freight
For inbound transportation of metallurgical coal purchases, our facilities that access a single rail provider have long-term transportation agreements, and where necessary, coal-mixing agreements that run concurrently with the associated coke sales agreement for the facility. At facilities with multiple transportation options, including rail and barge, we enter into short-term transportation contracts from year to year. Delivery costs are generally passed through to the customers.
For coke sales, the point of delivery varies by agreement and facility. The destination for coke sales under long-term, take-or-pay agreements from our Jewell and Haverhill cokemaking facilities is generally designated by the customer and shipments are made by railcar under long-term transportation agreements, which are passed through to our customers. At our Middletown, Indiana Harbor and Granite City cokemaking facilities, coke is delivered primarily by a conveyor belt leading to the customer’s blast furnace, with the customer responsible for additional transportation costs, if any. Most transportation and freight costs in our Logistics segment are paid by the customer directly to the transportation provider.
Research and Development and Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our research and development program seeks to improve existing and develop promising new cokemaking technologies, including new product development, and enhance our heat recovery processes. Over the years, this program has produced numerous patents related to our heat recovery coking design and operation, including patents for pollution control systems, oven pushing and charging mechanisms, oven flue gas control mechanisms and various others. Additionally, we have successfully utilized our existing coke ovens to produce foundry coke in addition to our primary product of blast furnace coke.
At Vitória, Brazil, where we operate one cokemaking facility on behalf of ArcelorMittal Brazil, we have intellectual property and licensing agreements in place for the entity’s use of our technology, under which we receive a per ton licensing fee as well as an annual licensing fee.
Competition
Cokemaking
The cokemaking business is highly competitive. Most of the world’s coke production capacity is owned by blast furnace steel companies utilizing by-product coke oven technology. The international merchant coke market is largely supplied by Chinese, Colombian and Ukrainian producers, among others, though it can be more challenging to maintain high quality coke in the export market, and when coupled with transportation costs, coke imports into the U.S. are often not economical.
The principal competitive factors affecting our cokemaking business include coke quality and price, reliability of supply, proximity to market, access to metallurgical coals and environmental performance. Our oven design and heat recovery technology play a role in all of these factors. Competitors include merchant coke producers as well as the cokemaking facilities owned and operated by blast furnace steel companies. 
In the past, there have been technologies which have sought to produce carbonaceous substitutes for coke in the blast furnace. While none have proven commercially viable thus far, we monitor the development of competing technologies carefully. We also monitor ferrous technologies, such as direct reduced iron production, as these could indirectly impact our blast furnace customers.
We believe we are well-positioned to compete with other coke producers. Our Domestic Coke segment accounts for approximately 30 percent of the U.S. blast furnace coke market capacity. Current production from our cokemaking business is largely committed under long-term, take-or-pay contracts. As a result, competition mainly affects our ability to obtain new contracts supporting development of additional cokemaking capacity, re-contracting existing facilities, as well as the sale of coke in the spot market. Our facilities were constructed using proven, industry-leading technology with many proprietary features allowing us to produce consistently higher quality coke than our competitors produce. Additionally, our technology allows us to produce heat that can be converted into steam or electrical power.
Logistics
The principal competitors of CMT are located on the U.S. Gulf Coast or U.S. East Coast. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast and provides strategic access to seaborne markets for coal and other bulk materials. Additionally, CMT is the largest bulk material terminal in the lower U.S. with direct rail access on the Canadian National Railway. In 2020, CMT accounted for approximately 55 percent of U.S. thermal coal exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast and approximately 15 percent of total U.S. thermal coal exports. CMT has a state-of-the-art ship loader, the largest of its kind in the world. We believe this ship loader has the fastest loading rate available in the Gulf Region, which should allow our 
customers to benefit from lower shipping costs. Additionally, CMT has a strategic alliance with a company that performs barge unloading services for the terminal, which provides CMT with the ability to transload and mix a significantly broader variety of materials.
Our KRT competitors are generally located within 100 miles of our operations. KRT has fully automated and computer-controlled mixing capabilities that mix coal to within two percent accuracy of customer specifications. KRT also has the ability to provide pad storage and has access to both CSX and Norfolk Southern rail lines as well as the Ohio River system. 
Lake Terminal and DRT provide coal handling and/or mixing services to our Indiana Harbor and Jewell cokemaking facilities, respectively, and therefore, do not have any competitors.

Workforce Stability & Leadership Experience 
Our commitment to employee retention through our development, benefits, performance management and incentive programs is shown through our low regrettable turnover rate of less than 1 percent in 2020. The stability of our workforce is anchored by our experienced corporate leadership team along with our General Managers that lead the day-to-day operations at our facilities. Our leaders each have an average of 20 years of leadership experience and an average of over 10 years with SunCoke. 
Employee Development & Training
SunCoke provides a robust training program that meets or exceeds all applicable regulatory requirements. We also provide specialized trainings on an as-needed basis for current topics throughout the year. Over the past several years, special training topics have included Active Shooter Preparedness, Harassment, Worker’s Compensation, Diversity and Inclusion, Conducting Effective Investigations and Retirement Planning.
SunCoke’s Personal Information & Privacy Policy lays out specific procedures to ensure that employees handle sensitive information in a secure and responsible manner. The Personal Information & Privacy Policy is updated to remain consistent with data security best practices. SunCoke utilizes a variety of information security training methods, including in-depth, periodic policy training, annual interactive video-based Code of Conduct training segments on data security best 
practices, and periodic security awareness communications that remind employees to stay vigilant with respect to data security.
We believe in developing our employees both within their daily roles and to be ready for their next assignment at SunCoke. Development occurs in the form of leadership training, stretch assignments, and on the job training. On an annual basis, we engage in succession management to ensure we focus development and training activities on our high performing and high potential talent, preparing potential successors for our most critical roles. Of the 107 positions filled in 2020, 47 (44 percent) were filled from within the Company. 
In many cases, we take a hands-on approach to training at SunCoke. As we pursued an additional business opportunity with foundry coke, we utilized intra-Company training of existing personnel to develop, implement, and execute this initiative. Leadership had the opportunity to provide many insights on topics from producing foundry to engaging new customers, highlighting the ability of our workforce to adjust to changing demands and grow with the Company. We pride ourselves on being a lean workforce that focuses on developing and promoting talent internally. 
Benefits
We offer comprehensive health, welfare and retirement benefits. We also offer supplemental benefits programs designed to enhance the daily life and well-being of our employees, including: weight-loss, benefits services price-transparency, retirement planning education and coaching, paid-time off (including for community service), tuition reimbursement, health management for chronic conditions and a 24/7 employee assistance program. 
Performance Management and Incentives 
Our full-year performance management process begins with setting annual goals for the Company, which guide the development of functional, local and individual employee goals. Employees and their managers are accountable for the goals and must review their performance against the goals on an ongoing basis. We provide employee base wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and geographic location. Additionally, we believe that individual performance and the results of the Company are directly linked to the payment of annual short-term incentives, which is why a significant portion of employee compensation is performance-based. Our short-term incentives include both financial metrics as well as performance-based environmental and safety metrics. The level of pay at risk increases progressively with positions of greater responsibility, with long-term cash and equity incentives with multi-year vesting periods granted at the Director, Vice President and Senior Vice President levels. Further, below the Director level, top performers may be granted long-term cash and equity incentives with multi-year vesting for retention. This helps the Company to retain those identified as having the top skills and abilities that are critical to our business.

We live by the ethos: Think Safe. Act Safe. Be Safe.
Our top priority has always been the safety of our employees, contractors and visitors. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this became even more challenging as we worked to ensure workplace safety was maintained while also ensuring that our employees were protected from the virus. In response to the pandemic, we established an internal task force of subject matter experts, initiated enhanced health and safety measures across our facilities and enacted a work from home program for all qualifying personnel. Each of our sites implemented screening procedures consistent with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") recommendations such as screening questionnaires and temperature checks for employees, contractors and other service providers. Additionally, to ensure employee safety, we adopted further protocols consistent with CDC, state and local guidance including mask wearing, social distancing, contact tracing and quarantine requirements.
Safety is so important to SunCoke that we include safety in our core values and also incorporate safety as a metric in our short-term incentive program. 
We have an ambition of zero incidents and injuries in the workplace. To reach our goal, we follow our Safety Vision, which is comprised of five core components including:
•Visible safety leadership - Site and corporate leadership have made a commitment to safety as the paramount value within the company and our site leadership practices visible safety leadership on a daily basis.
•Communication and training - All team members and contractors take responsibility for their own safety and the safety of those around them and we train to ensure proper safety knowledge. 
•Safe work practices - All team members and contractors take the time necessary to properly identify and mitigate all hazards and safely do each job.
•Incident investigation – We comply with all applicable laws and regulations and perform root cause analysis on all incidents. 
•Continuous improvement – We are always focused on preventing safety incidents and Thinking Safe, Acting Safe and Being Safe.
Our target for Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") at SunCoke for 2020 was 0.70 company-wide, and at the end of the year, it was 0.81. At SunCoke, our focus is on continuous safety improvement and while we did not achieve our target this past year, we improved our safety performance from 2019 and continue to perform well above industry standards, as detailed below.
Our excellent safety record is best understood in comparison to industry-wide safety performance. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the TRIR within our sector of Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing was 1.3 for 2019. For comparison, it was 2.4 for the Iron and Steel Mills sector. Our year-over-year safety performance is consistently lower than average industry-wide rates, signaling fewer recordable incidents and demonstrating our strong commitment to safety. In a year especially filled with external stressors and distractions, we successfully managed to keep our employees focused on safety and the job at hand. 

Year | Employee TRIR | Contractor TRIR
2018 | 0.59 | 1.03 
2019 | 0.9 | 0.8 
2020 | 1.08 | 0.38 

Ethics & Compliance 
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our officers, directors and employees, including senior financial officers and executives. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, along with our Core Values, establish the principles that guide our daily actions to uphold the highest standards of ethical and legal behavior. Whether working with customers, vendors, business partners or neighbors, we always strive to act with integrity. All employees must complete annual training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which we review and update as needed. The most recent updates occurred in 2019. We educate all employees to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Our Prohibited Payments and Political Contributions Policy addresses payments made to U.S. officials, including campaign contributions. Our Gifts, Entertainment and Sponsored Travel Policy provides guidance regarding business courtesies, including reporting obligations and value limitations. We also have a Human Rights Policy, which affirms our commitment to a fair living wage for all employees.
Guidance & Reporting Without Fear of Retaliation
All employees, officers and directors must report suspected policy violations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to the Compliance Team, which consists of our Chief Compliance Officer and other leaders from the Human Resources and Legal Departments. They can do so through a variety of channels, including, but not limited to, directly reporting to a supervisor, providing email or verbal reports directly to the Compliance Team and using our confidential, third-party 24/7 reporting hotline or website. Calls and online submissions are anonymous, unless the notifying party discloses his or her identity. We take the anonymity of these communications seriously and SunCoke’s Compliance Team follows up on each submission. In addition to the anonymous hotline, hourly employees represented by a collective bargaining unit can also file a report using the applicable union grievance process.
Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including environmental laws, which are a significant factor in our business. The following discussion summarizes the principal legal and regulatory requirements that we believe may significantly affect us.
Permitting and Bonding
•Permitting Process for Cokemaking Facilities. The permitting process for our cokemaking facilities is administered by each state individually. However, the main requirements for obtaining environmental construction and operating permits are found in the federal regulations. A construction permit allows construction and commencement of operations at the facility and is generally valid for at least 18 months. Generally, construction commences during this period, while many states allow this period to be extended in certain situations. A facility's operating permit may be a state operating permit or a Title V operating permit. 
•Air Quality. Our cokemaking facilities employ Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards designed to limit emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants. Specific MACT standards apply to oven door leaks, charging, oven pressure, pushing and quenching. Certain MACT standards for cokemaking facilities were developed using test data from SunCoke's Jewell cokemaking facility located in Vansant, Virginia. Additionally, under applicable federal air quality regulations, permitting requirements may differ among facilities, depending upon whether the cokemaking facility will be located in an “attainment” area—i.e., one that meets the national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for certain pollutants, or in a “non-attainment” or "unclassifiable" area. The status of an area may change over time as new NAAQS standards are adopted, resulting in an area changing from one status or classification to another. In an attainment area, the facility must install air pollution control equipment or employ Best Achievable Control Technology (BACT). In a non-attainment area, the facility must install air pollution control equipment or employ procedures that meet Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) standards. LAER standards are the most stringent emission limitation achieved in practice by existing facilities. Unlike the BACT analysis, cost is generally not considered as part of a LAER analysis, and emissions in a non-attainment area must be offset by emission reductions obtained from other sources. Any changes in attainment status for areas where our facilities are located presents a risk that we may be required to install additional pollution controls, which may require us to incur greater operating costs at those facilities.
•More stringent NAAQS for ambient nitrogen dioxide ("NO2") and sulfur dioxide ("SO2") went into effect in 2010. In July 2013, the EPA identified or "designated" as non-attainment 29 areas in 16 states where monitored air quality showed violations of the 2010 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. In December 2017, EPA issued a final designation of attainment or unclassifiable for all areas where our facilities are located. These designations mean that no future action is required for the facilities with respect to SO2 emissions at this time. However, it is possible for these areas to be redesignated in the future as non-attainment areas. If redesignated, we may be required to install additional pollution controls and incur greater costs of operating at those of our facilities located in areas that EPA determines to be non-attainment with the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. 
•In 2012, more stringent NAAQS for fine particulate matter ("PM"), or PM 2.5, went into effect. In January 2015, the areas where the Granite City and Indiana Harbor facilities are located were designated unclassifiable for PM 2.5, and the areas where the Haverhill and Jewell facilities are located were designated unclassifiable/attainment for PM 2.5. In April 2015, the area where the Middletown facility is located was designated unclassifiable/attainment for PM 2.5. 
•In November 2015, the EPA revised the existing NAAQS for ground level ozone to make the standard more stringent. In January 2018, EPA designated the areas where the Haverhill and Jewell facilities are located as attainment/unclassifiable for ozone. In June 2018, EPA designated the areas where the Granite City, Indiana Harbor, and Middletown facilities are located as marginal nonattainment for ozone. In December 2020, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency informed stakeholders in the Cincinnati and Cleveland nonattainment areas, including the Middletown facility, that the agency anticipates those areas will be reclassified as moderate nonattainment areas by the U.S. EPA in late 2021. Nonattainment designations under the new standard and any future more stringent standard for ozone have two potential impacts: (1) demonstrating compliance with the standard using dispersion modeling for permitting new facilities or significant new projects may be more difficult; and (2) facilities operating in areas that are classified moderate non-attainment areas may be required to install Reasonably Available Control Technology (“RACT”) or demonstrate that they already meet RACT standards. While we are not able to determine the extent to which this new standard will impact our business at this time, it presents a potential risk of having an impact on our operations.
•The EPA adopted a rule in 2010 requiring a new facility that is a major source of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) to install equipment or employ BACT procedures. Currently, there is little information on what may be acceptable as BACT to control GHGs (primarily carbon dioxide from our facilities), but the database and additional guidance may be enhanced in the future.
•Several states have additional requirements and standards other than those in the federal statutes and regulations. Many states have lists of “air toxics” with emission limitations determined by dispersion modeling. States also often have specific regulations that deal with visible emissions, odors and nuisance. In some cases, the state delegates some or all of these functions to local agencies.
•Wastewater and Stormwater. Our heat recovery cokemaking technology does not produce wastewater as is typically associated with by-product cokemaking. Our cokemaking facilities, in some cases, have wastewater and/or stormwater discharge permits.
•Waste. The primary solid waste product from our heat recovery cokemaking technology is calcium sulfate from flue gas desulfurization, which is generally taken to a solid waste landfill. On the whole, our heat recovery cokemaking process does not generate substantial quantities of hazardous waste as is typically associated with by-product cokemaking. The material from periodic cleaning of heat recovery steam generators has been disposed of as hazardous waste. Our facilities only generate wastes and do not have permits for waste transportation, storage or disposal. 
•U.S. Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Endangered Species Act and certain counterpart state regulations are intended to protect species whose populations allow for categorization as either endangered or threatened. With respect to permitting additional cokemaking facilities, protection of endangered or threatened species may have the effect of prohibiting, limiting the extent of or placing permitting conditions on soil removal, road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species. Based on the species that have been designated as endangered or threatened on our properties and the current application of these laws and regulations, we do not believe that they are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
•Permitting and Bonding for Former Coal Mining Operations. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”) and applicable state equivalents govern mining permits and reclamation plans, documents defining ownership and agreements pertaining to coal, minerals, oil and gas, water rights, rights of way and surface land and documents required by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s (“OSM’s”) Applicant Violator System. 
We currently have no applications pending for new SMCRA permits, but hold several permits for which reclamation is incomplete.
Our reclamation obligations under applicable environmental laws could be substantial. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), we are required to account for the costs related to the closure of mines and the reclamation of the land upon exhaustion of coal reserves. The fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. At which time, the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. At December 31, 2020, we had an asset retirement obligation of $2.0 million related to estimated mine reclamation costs. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, inflation rates, and the assumed credit-adjusted interest rates. Our future operating results would be adversely affected if these accruals were determined to be insufficient. These obligations are unfunded. Failure to comply with the regulatory requirements can result in sanctions.
•Bonding Requirements for Permits Related to Former Coal Mining Operations and Coal Terminals with Surface Mining Permits. Before a SMCRA permit or a surface mining permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or other form of financial security to guarantee the payment and performance of certain long-term mine closure and reclamation obligations. The costs of these bonds or other forms of financial security have fluctuated in recent years and the market terms of surety bonds generally have become less favorable to those entities with legacy mining obligations or terminal operators and others with such permits. These changes in the terms of such bonds have been accompanied, at times, by a decrease in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds. As of December 31, 2020, we have posted $9.6 million in surety bonds or other forms of financial security for future reclamation. 
Regulation of Operations 
•Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act and similar state laws and regulations affect our cokemaking operations, primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements relating to PM and SO2 and MACT standards. The Clean Air Act air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to: the Acid Rain Program; NAAQS implementation for SO2, PM and nitrogen oxides (“NOx”), lead ozone and carbon monoxide; GHG rules; the Clean Air Interstate Rule; MACT emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants; the Regional Haze Program; New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”); and New Source Review. The Clean Air Act requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of various industry-specific MACT standards. Our cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of MACT standards. The first category 
applies to pushing and quenching. The second category applies to emissions from charging and coke oven doors. The EPA is required to make a risk-based determination for pushing and quenching emissions and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary. In 2016, EPA issued a request for information and testing to our cokemaking facilities and other companies as part of its residual risk and technology review of the MACT standard for pushing and quenching, and a technology review of the MACT standard for coke ovens and charging emissions. Testing was conducted by our cokemaking facilities in 2017, but the EPA has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards. While we are not able to determine the extent to which any new standards will impact our business at this time, it presents a potential risk of having an impact on our operations and cost structure.
•Terminal Operations. Our terminal operations located along waterways and the Gulf of Mexico are also governed by permitting requirements under the CWA and CAA. These terminals are subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations and comparable state statutes regarding design, installation, construction, and management. Many such terminals owned and operated by other entities that are also used to transport coal and petcoke, including for export, have been pursued by environmental interest groups for alleged violations of their permits’ requirements, or have seen their efforts to obtain or renew such permits contested by such groups. While we believe that our operations are in material compliance with these permits, it is possible that such challenges or claims will be made against our operations in the future. Moreover, our terminal operations may be affected by the impacts of additional regulation on petcoke or on the mining of all types of coal and use of thermal coal for fuel, which is restricting supply in some markets and may reduce the volumes of coal that our terminals manage. 
•Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the sales of electricity from our Haverhill and Middletown facilities, including the implementation of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”). The nature of the operations of the Haverhill and Middletown facilities makes each facility a qualifying facility under PURPA, which exempts the facilities and the Company from certain regulatory burdens, including the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA”), limited provisions of the FPA, and certain state laws and regulation. FERC has granted requests for authority to sell electricity from the Haverhill and Middletown facilities at market-based rates and the entities are subject to FERC’s market-based rate regulations, which require regular regulatory compliance filings. 
•Clean Water Act of 1972. The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) may affect our operations by requiring water quality standards generally and through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”). Regular monitoring, reporting requirements and performance standards are requirements of NPDES permits that govern the discharge of pollutants into water. Discharges must either meet state water quality standards or be authorized through available regulatory processes such as alternate standards or variances. Additionally, through the CWA Section 401 certification program, states have approval authority over water discharge permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to their waters. Similarly, for permitting or any future water intake and/or discharge projects, our facilities could be subject to the Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permitting process.
•Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We may generate wastes, including “solid” wastes and “hazardous” wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. The EPA has limited the disposal options for certain wastes that are designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Furthermore, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our operations that currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements. Certain of our wastes are also subject to Department of Transportation regulations for shipping of materials. Any changes to hazardous waste standards or the constituents in the wastes generated at our facilities presents a potential risk of having an impact on our operations and cost structure. 
•Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, and similar state laws, responsibility for the entire cost of clean-up of a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators, or upon any party who released one or more designated “hazardous substances” at the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination. In the course of our operations we may have generated and may generate wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We also may be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. Under CERCLA, we may be responsible for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. We also must comply with reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act.
•Pursuant to a court-mandated deadline, EPA published a final rule in December 2020 that does not impose financial assurance requirements for managing hazardous substances on the coal products manufacturing sector under Section 108(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA 108(b)”). EPA’s final rule determined that the risks associated with these facilities’ operations are addressed by existing federal and state programs and regulations and modern industry practices. 
•Climate Change Legislation and Regulations. Our facilities are presently subject to the GHG reporting rule, which obligates us to report annual emissions of GHGs. The EPA also finalized a rule in 2010 requiring a new facility that is a major source of GHGs to install equipment or employ BACT procedures. In 2014, the Supreme Court issued an opinion holding that although EPA may not treat GHGs as a pollutant for the purpose of determining whether a source must obtain a PSD or Title V permit, EPA may continue to require GHG limitations in permits for sources classified as major based on their emission of other pollutants. Currently there is little information as to what may constitute BACT for GHG in most industries. Under this rule, certain modifications to our facilities could subject us to the additional permitting and other obligations relative to emissions of GHGs under the New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("NSR/PSD") and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act based on whether the facility triggered NSR/PSD because of emissions of another pollutant such as SO2, NOx, PM, ozone or lead. The EPA has engaged in rulemaking to regulate GHG emissions from existing and new coal fired power plants, and we expect continued legal challenges to this rulemaking and any future rulemaking for other industries. For instance, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan rules establishing carbon pollution standards for power plants. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the Clean Power Plan before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision on the rule. In October 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan ("CPP"). On October 9, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected any further challenges to the decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan. EPA then proposed the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule as a replacement for the CPP in August 2018, which it finalized in June 2019. In 2020, various legal challenges to ACE were filed by more than two dozen states and cities, along with environmental activist groups and a coalition of utility companies. 
Currently, we do not anticipate these new or existing power plant GHG rules to apply directly to our facilities. However, the impact of current and future GHG-related legislation and regulations have on us will depend on a number of factors, including whether GHG sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, the degree to which GHG offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and actions by the states in implementing these requirements. Any new GHG reduction laws on regulations that apply to us will likely require us to incur increased operating and capital costs and/or increased taxes on GHG emissions. We may not recover the costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements imposed on us from our customers due to limitations in our agreements. The imposition of a carbon tax or similar regulation could materially and adversely affect our revenues. Collectively, these requirements along with restrictions and requirements regarding the mining of all types of coal may reduce the volumes of coal that we manage and may ultimately adversely impact our revenues. Depending on whether another rule is promulgated in the future, it could increase the demand for natural gas-generated electricity.
•Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the “Miner Act”), has increased significantly the enforcement of safety and health standards and imposed safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. There also has been a significant increase in the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued. We no longer operate coal mines subject to the Miner Act.
•Occupational Safety and Health ACT (OSH Act). Our facilities are subject to regulation by OSHA or MSHA under the OSH Act and other agencies with standards designed to ensure worker safety. These standards impose minimum requirements for our operations to maintain and operate sites and equipment in a safe manner. As noted above, we have consistently operated within the top quartiles for OSHA’s recordable injury rates as measured and reported by the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute.
•Security. CMT is subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard pursuant to the Maritime Transportation Security Act. We have an internal inspection program designed to monitor and ensure compliance by CMT with these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of the facility.
•Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981. Under these laws, U.S. coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits and medical expenses to claimants who are current and former employees and last worked for the operator after July 1, 1973. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), which was implemented in 2010, amended previous legislation and provides for the automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and changes the legal criteria used to assess and award claims. SunCoke is not an active coal mine operator and does not perform or oversee coal mining. However, SunCoke has retained certain black lung liabilities associated with legacy coal operations. Our obligation related to black lung benefits at December 31, 2020 was $64.6 million and was estimated based on various assumptions, including actuarial estimates, discount rates, number of active claims, changes in health care costs and the impact of PPACA.
Environmental Matters and Compliance
Our failure to comply with the aforementioned requirements may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of clean-up and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations, which could in turn have an impact on our financial condition. Please see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Notices of Violation ("NOVs") issued by the EPA and state regulators for our Haverhill, Granite City, and Indiana Harbor cokemaking facilities.
Other legal and administrative proceedings are pending or may be brought against us arising out of our current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, antitrust, employment claims, premises-liability claims, allegations of exposures of third-parties to toxic substances and general environmental claims. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time, it is reasonably possible that some of them could be resolved unfavorably to us. Management of the Company believes that any liability which may arise from such matters would not be material in relation to the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company at December 31, 2020.
