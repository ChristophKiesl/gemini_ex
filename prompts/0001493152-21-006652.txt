ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Business History
 
Our company was incorporated as LandStar, Inc., a Nevada corporation, on May 4, 1998, for the purpose of purchasing, developing and reselling real property, with its principal focus on the development of raw land. From incorporation through December 31, 1998, we had no business operations and was a development-stage company. We did not purchase or develop any properties and decided to change our business plan and operations. On March 31, 1999, we acquired approximately 98.5% of the common stock of Rebound Rubber Corp. (“Rebound Rubber”) pursuant to a share exchange agreement with Rebound Rubber and substantially all of Rebound Rubber’s shareholders. The acquisition was effected by issuing 14,500,100 shares of common stock, which constituted 14.5% of the 100,000,000 of our authorized shares, and 50.6% of the 28,622,100 issued and outstanding shares on completion of the acquisition.
 
The share exchange with Rebound Rubber (and other transactions occurring in March 1999) resulted in a change of control and the appointment of new officers and directors. These transactions also changed our focus to the development and utilization of technology to de-vulcanize and reactivate recycled rubber for resale as a raw material in the production of new rubber products. Our business strategy was to sell the de-vulcanized material (and compounds using the materials) to manufacturers of rubber products.
 
Prior to 2001 we had no revenues. In 2001 and 2002 revenues were derived from management services rendered to a rubber recycling company.
 
In August 2001, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to authorize 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. We may designate preferred stock into specific classes by action of our board of directors. In May 2008, our board of directors established a class of Convertible Preferred Series A (the “Series A”), authorizing 10,000,000 shares. When established, among other things, (i) each share of Series A was convertible into 1,000 shares of our common stock, and (ii) a holder of Series A was entitled to vote 1,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series A on all matters submitted to a vote by stockholders.
 
In September 2008, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares to 985,000,000, $0.001 par value per share, further amended the Articles in January 2009 to increase the number of authorized shares to 4,000,000,000, and in January 2010 amended our Articles to increase the number of authorized shares to 8,888,000,000.
 
We were effectively dormant for a number of years. In or around February 2014, there was a change in control whereby Kevin Hayes acquired 1,000,000 shares of the Series A and was appointed as our sole director and officer. In or around April 2017, there was another change in control when Mr. Hayes sold the 1,000,000 shares of Series A to Hybrid Titan Management, which then proceeded to assign the Series A to William Alessi. Mr. Alessi was then appointed as our sole director and officer. Mr. Alessi initiated legal action in his home state of North Carolina to confirm, among other things, his ownership of the Series A; his “control” over the company, and the status of creditors of the company. In or around June 2017, the court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Alessi, confirming his majority ownership and control of the company.
 
In or around July 2017, while under the majority ownership and management of Mr. Alessi, we sought to effect a merger transaction (the “Merger”) under which the company would be merged into Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (“Data443”). Data443 was originally formed under the name LandStar, Inc. The name of the North Carolina corporation was changed to Data443 in December 2017. In November 2017, our controlling interest was acquired by our current chief executive officer and sole board member, Jason Remillard, when he acquired all of the Series A shares from Mr. Alessi. In that same transaction, Mr. Remillard also acquired all of the shares of Data443 from Mr. Alessi. Mr. Remillard was then appointed as our sole director and sole officer and of Data443.

In January 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Myriad Software Productions, LLC, which was owned 100% by Mr. Remillard. Those assets were comprised of the software program known as ClassiDocs®, and all intellectual property and goodwill associated therewith. As a result of the acquisition, the Company was no longer a “shell” under applicable securities rules. In consideration for the acquisition, we agreed to a purchase price of $1,500,000, comprised of: (i) $50,000 paid at closing; (ii) $250,000 in the form of a promissory note; and (iii) $1,200,000 in shares of our common stock, valued as of the closing, which equated to 1,200,000,000 shares of our common stock. The shares have not yet been issued and are not included as part of our issued and outstanding shares. However, these shares have been recorded as “Acquisition of ClassiDocs” included in additional paid in capital within our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019.
 
In April 2018, we amended the designation for our Series A by providing that a holder of Series A was entitled to (i) vote 15,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series A on all matters submitted to a vote by stockholders, and (ii) convert each share of Series A into 1,000 shares of our common stock.
 
In May 2018, the Company amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation. The total authorized number of shares is 8,888,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, designated in the discretion of our board of directors. The Series A remains in full force and effect.
 
In June 2018, after careful analysis and in reliance upon professional advisors we retained, it was determined that the Merger had, in fact, not been completed, and that the Merger was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. As such, the Merger was legally terminated. In place of the Merger, in June 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Data443 (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Data443 became our wholly-owned subsidiary, with both the Company and Data443 continuing to exist as corporate entities. As consideration in the Share Exchange, we agreed to issue to Mr. Remillard: (a) 100,000,000 shares of our common stock and (b) on the eighteen-month anniversary of the closing of the Share Exchange (the “Earn Out Date”), an additional 100,000,000 shares of our common stock, provided that Data443 has at least an additional $1,000,000 in revenue by the Earn Out Date (not including revenue directly from acquisitions). None of the shares of our common stock to be issued to Mr. Remillard under the Share Exchange have been issued. As such, none of said shares are included as part of our issued and outstanding shares. However, these shares have been recorded as “Share exchange with related party for Data443 additional share issuable” included in additional paid in capital within our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019.
 
On or about June 29, 2018, we secured the rights to the WordPress GDPR Framework through our wholly-owned subsidiary Data443 for a total consideration of €40,001, or approximately $46,521, payable in four payments of approximately €10,000, with the first payment due at closing, and the remaining payments due at the end of July, August and September 2018. Upon issuance of the final payment, we gained the right to enter into an asset transfer agreement for the nominal cost of one euro (€1).
 
On or about October 22, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Modevity, LLC (“Modevity”) to acquire certain assets collectively known as ARALOC®, a software-as-a service (“SaaS”) platform that provides cloud-based data storage, protection, and workflow automation. The acquired assets consist of intellectual and related intangible property including applications and associated software code, and trademarks. Access to books and records related to the customers and revenues Modevity created on the ARALOC platform were also included in the asset purchase agreement. These assets were substantially less than the total assets of Modevity, and revenues from the platform comprised a portion of the overall sales of Modevity. We are required to create the technical capabilities to support the ongoing operation of this SaaS platform. A substantial effort on our part is needed to continue generating ARALOC revenues through development of a sales force, as well as billing and collection processes. We paid Modevity (i) $200,000 in cash, (ii) $750,000, in the form of a 10-month promissory note, and (iii) 164,533,821 shares of our common stock.
 
On or around February 7, 2019, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Management Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Wala, Inc. (“Wala”). Under the License Agreement the Company was granted the exclusive right and license to receive all benefits from the marketing, selling, and licensing of the data archiving platform known as ArcMail and all assets related thereto (the “ArcMail Assets”). In connection with the License Agreement, the Company also executed (i) a Stock Rights Agreement, under which the Company had the right to acquire all shares of stock of Wala; and, (ii) a Business Covenants Agreement, under which Wala and its CEO agreed to not compete with the Company’s use of the ArcMail assets for a designated period of time. The License Agreement, Stock Rights Agreement, and Business Covenants Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the “ArcMail Agreements”).

On October 14, 2019, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc., and to effect a 1-for-750 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common and preferred shares, each with $0.001 par value, and to reduce the numbers of authorized common and preferred shares to 60,000,000 and 337,500, respectively. On October 28, 2019, the name change and the split and changes in authorized common and preferred shares was effected, resulting in approximately 7,282,678,714 issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock to be reduced to approximately 9,710,239, and 1,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s preferred shares to be reduced to 1,334 as of October 28, 2019.

On December 11, 2020, the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (“CSPA”) with Triton Funds, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Triton”), an unrelated third party. Triton agreed to invest $1 million in the Company in the form of common stock purchases. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the CSPA, the Company agreed to sell to Triton common shares of the Company having an aggregate value of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). The price of the shares to be sold will be $0.006 per shares. Triton’s obligation to purchase securities is conditioned on certain factors including, but not limited, to the Company having an effective registration available for resale of the securities being purchased; a minimum closing price of $0.009 per share for the Company’s common stock on the delivery date for the shares; and, Triton’s ownership not exceeding 9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company at any time. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on December 28, 2020. The S-1 was declared effective by the SEC as of January 26, 2021.
 
On February 12, 2021, and effective January 31, 2021 the Company declared terminated each of the ArcMail Agreements. The Company has asserted numerous claims under the ArcMail Agreements.

The Company considers its relationship with Wala to be closed and will not pursue any further action in that regard.
 
On February 12, 2021 the Company closed its acquisition of the ArcMail Assets from the Wala Creditors pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Asset Sale Agreement executed by and between the Company and the Wala Creditors. The effective date of the Asset Sale Agreement and the acquisition was deemed to be January 31, 2021.

Payments under the Notes commence in 30-days and continue monthly thereafter for 60-months. The Notes are secured by a pledge of the ArcMail Assets as collateral under the terms of a Security Agreement in favor of the Wala Creditors. The foregoing descriptions of the Asset Sale Agreement; Notes; and, Security Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the actual language contained in the Asset Sale Agreement, Notes, and Security Agreement, respectively.

Business Overview
 
We are in the data security and privacy business, operating as a software and services provider. Data security and privacy legislation, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), is driving significant investment by organizations to offset risks from data breaches and damaging information disclosures of various types. We provide solutions for the marketplace that are designed to protect data via the cloud, hybrid, and on-premises architectures. Our suite of security products focus on the protection of: sensitive files and emails; confidential customer, patient, and employee data; financial records; strategic and product plans; intellectual property; and any other data requiring security, allowing our clients to create, share, and protect their data wherever it is stored.
 
We deliver solutions and capabilities via all technical architectures, and in formats designed for each client. Licensing and subscription models are available to conform to customer purchasing requirements. Our solutions are driven by several proprietary technologies and methodologies that we have developed or acquired, giving us our primary competitive advantage.

We intend to sell substantially all of our products and services directly to end-users, though some sales may also be effected through channel partners, including distributors and resellers which sell to end-user customers. We believe that our sales model, which combines the leverage of a channel sales model with our own highly trained and professional sales force, will play a significant role in our ability to grow and to successfully deliver our value proposition for data security. While our products serve customers of all sizes in all industries, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 100 users or more who can make larger purchases with us over time and have a greater potential lifetime value. We also intend to focus on the European Union, as the GDPR has driven increased IT spending as companies seek to securely manage data and comply with the GDPR. Targeted industries include the financial services, healthcare, public, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, consumer and retail, education, media and entertainment and technology sectors.
 
Size of Our Market Opportunity
 
Worldwide spending on information security products and services will reach more than $114 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.4 percent from last year, according to the latest forecast from Gartner, Inc. In 2019, the market was forecast to grow 8.7 percent to $124 billion, with further increases expected for 2020. As cloud-based services increase in popularity, that market increases to an estimated $300 billion by 2021. The International Data Corporation’s Data Age 2025: The Evolution of Data to Life-Critical study estimates that the amount of data created in the world will grow to 163 Zettabytes (or 151 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, representing a nearly tenfold increase from the amount created in 2016. They estimate that nearly 20% of that data will be critical to our daily lives (and nearly 10% will be hypercritical). The study also suggests that by 2025, almost 90% of all data will require a meaningful level of security, but less than half will be secured. Every enterprise and governmental agency will almost certainly require new technologies to protect and manage data.
 
We believe that the functionalities offered by our programs and services position us to benefit from this growing market. Further, as we continue to grow our business, we believe that we may have opportunities to expand into collateral growing markets, such IT operations management, storage management and data integration.
 
Our Products
 
We currently have eight major product lines, each of which provides features and functionality which enable our clients to fully secure the value of their data. This architecture easily extends through modular functionalities, giving our clients the flexibility to select the features they require for their business needs and the flexibility to expand their usage simply by adding a license.

Expand Our Sales Force. Continuing to expand our salesforce will be essential to achieving our customer base expansion goals. We have recently expand our sales capacity by adding headcount throughout our sales and marketing department. As we continue to grow, we intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing department.
 
Increase Sales to Existing Customers. We believe significant opportunities exist to further expand relationships with our existing customers. We will continue to cultivate incremental sales from our existing customers by driving increased use of our software within our installed base by expanding footprint and usage. As we innovate and expand our product offering, we expect to have an even broader suite of products to offer our customers. Our key strategies to ensure a high subscription license renewal rate and maintain our high maintenance renewal rate include focusing on the quality and reliability of our customer service and support teams to ensure our customers receive value from our products and providing software upgrades and enhancements when and if they are available.
 
Focus on International Opportunities. We believe there is a significant opportunity for our products and services in the EU and other international markets in order to enable compliance with the GDPR. We recently an office in Dubai, which has already resulted in significant new business for us. We believe that a focus on international markets will be a key component of our growth strategy, and we will continue to market our products and services overseas.
 
Our Customers
 
Our current customer base is comprised primarily of customers purchasing ARALOC, ArcMail, DataExpress, and ClassiDocs products. Our customers vary greatly in size, ranging from small and medium businesses to large enterprises.
Services
 
Maintenance and Support
 
Our intended customers will typically purchase software maintenance and support as part of their initial purchase of our products. These maintenance agreements provide customers the right to receive support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they become available during the maintenance period and access to our technical support services. We will maintain a customer support organization that provides all levels of support to our customers.
Professional Services
 
While users can easily download, install and deploy our software on their own, we anticipate that certain enterprises will use our professional service team to provide fee-based services, which include training our customers in the use of our products, providing advice on deployment planning, network design, product configuration and implementation, automating and customizing reports and tuning policies and configuration of our products for the particular characteristics of the customer’s environment.
Sales and Marketing

We have a highly-trained professional sales force that is responsible for overall market development, including the management of the relationships with our channel partners and supporting channel partners.

Marketing
 
Our marketing strategy focuses on building our brand and product awareness, increasing customer adoption and demand, communicating advantages and business benefits and generating leads for our channel partners and sales force. We will market our products as a solution for securing and managing file systems and enterprise data and protecting against cyber-attacks. Our internal marketing organization will be responsible for branding, content generation and product marketing. Our marketing efforts will also include public relations in multiple regions, analyst relations, customer marketing, and extensive content development available through our web site and social media outlets.
Seasonality
 
Our business is not subject to seasonality.
 
Research and Development
 
While currently limited, our planned research and development efforts will be focused on improving and enhancing our existing products and services, as well as developing new products, features and functionality. We plan to regularly release new versions of our products which incorporate new features and enhancements to existing ones.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company has a policy of requiring key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship. The Company’s employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to it all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with the Company. In addition, the Company has a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which it discusses potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements. The Company’s agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or technology or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
 
We currently make use of a number of trademarks in our business, including, without limitation, the following:
 

● | ClassiDocs® 
--+-------------
● | ARALOC® 
● | DataExpress™

 
Unlike copyrights and patents, trademark rights can last indefinitely so long as the owner continues to use the mark to identify its goods or services. The term of a federal trademark is ten years, with ten-year renewal terms. The number of years remaining for the federal trademark on the three trademarks we make use of in our business is as follows:
 
ClassiDocs: Eight years
 
ARALOC: Four years
 
DataExpress: Fourteen years
 
Competition
 
The industry in which we compete is highly competitive. Many companies offer similar products and services for data security. We may be at a substantial disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out operations and marketing efforts. We hope to maintain our competitive advantage by offering quality at a competitive price, and by utilizing the experience, knowledge, and expertise of our management team.

10
--


We will face competition from more established companies that have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger sales, marketing, research and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development costs, which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. Increased competition could result in us failing to attract customers or maintaining them. It could also lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed.
 
Employees
 
As of March 23, 2021, we had 22 employees and independent contractors, of which one was considered to be part of our management team; our sole director and officer, Jason Remillard. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. The Company believes that it will be successful in attracting experienced and capable personnel. The Company’s employees are not represented by any labor union.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety of our employees and business partners has been made a priority, while continuing to support the needs of our customers and communities during the continuation of the pandemic. We temporarily closed our headquarters, and we continue to closely monitor and comply with state and local requirements, guidelines, and recommendations. We shifted from existing flexible working arrangements to working from home on a regular basis, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to maintain productivity and to remain in contact with our employees, business partners, and customers. We have also limited travel to further support and protect our employees.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may include business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.
Legal Proceedings
 
The Company may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature it believes are normal and incidental to its business. These matters may include product liability, intellectual property, employment, personal injury cause by the Company’s employees, and other general claims. The Company is not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of its management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Properties
 
Our principal executive office is located at 101 J Morris Commons Lane, Suite 105, Morrisville, North Carolina 27560. The space is a shared office space, which at the current time is suitable for the conduct of our business.
Going Concern
 
We are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment and other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations. We may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing, from financial institutions or otherwise, in order to maintain and expand our existing operations. The failure by us to obtain such financing would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report in our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to the effect that our limited operations and lack of profitability raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. We may be required to cease operations which could result in our stockholders losing all or almost all of their investment.
