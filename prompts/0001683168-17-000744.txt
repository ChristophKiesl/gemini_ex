Recent Developments
 
Warrant Exercise
 
On February 9, 2017, we entered into a private transaction (the “Private Transaction”) pursuant to a Warrant Exercise Agreement (the “Agreement”) with certain holders of our existing warrants (the “Original Warrants”). The Original Warrants were originally issued on November 3, 2015, to purchase an aggregate of 1,443,362 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), at an exercise price of $3.30 per share and were to expire on November 3, 2020.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, the holders of the Original Warrants and we agreed that such Original Warrant holders would exercise their Original Warrants in full and we would issue to each such holder new warrants, with the new warrants being identical to the Original Warrants except that the termination date of such new warrants is February 10, 2022 (the “Reload Warrants”). In addition, depending on the number of Original Warrants exercised by all holders of the Original Warrants, we also agreed to issue to the holders another new warrant, identical to the Original Warrant except that the exercise price of such warrant is $5.30 and such warrant is not exercisable until August 10, 2017 (the “Market Price Warrants” and together with the Reload Warrants, the “New Warrants”).
 
We received gross proceeds of $3,866,573 from the exercise of the Original Warrants and issued Reload Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 799,991 shares of our Common Stock and Market Price Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 371,699 shares of our Common Stock.
 
Chardan Capital Markets LLC acted as financial advisor on the Private Transaction in consideration for which it received $363,617 and was issued New Warrants for 115,000 shares of Common Stock.
 
Reverse Stock Split and Listing on Nasdaq
 
On November 4, 2016, we effected a reverse stock split on a one-to-three basis. The reverse stock split became effective on November 9, 2016. The reverse stock split was implemented to facilitate our successful uplisting on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Unless otherwise noted, all share and per share data give effect to such reverse stock split of our Common Stock.
Distribution Agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Inc.
 
On February 18, 2016, we entered into a distribution agreement (“Distribution Agreement”) with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Inc. (“Sony”), pursuant to which we agreed to grant Sony certain rights for the marketing and distribution of our animated feature-length motion pictures and animated television series in the United States and Canada, and potentially additional countries. In consideration for such rights, and subject to certain conditions, Sony has paid us an advance in the amount of $2.0 million, against future royalties.

On January 10, 2017, we entered into an amendment of our home entertainment distribution agreement with Sony pursuant to which, among other things, Sony agreed to pay $1,489,583 which was owed and payable by us to Sony’s sister company Sony DADC US Inc. (“DADC”) for certain disk manufacturing and replication services.
 
In connection with such transaction, we issued Sony 301,231 shares of our Common Stock at $4.945 per share, Sony’s exclusive territory for exercising its home entertainment distribution rights under the Distribution Agreement was extended from the United States and Canada to worldwide, and the amount of advances subject to recoupment by Sony out of royalty payments that would otherwise be due to us under the Distribution Agreement was increased by the amount of the payment to DADC. Future cash flow from the distributed products under the Distribution Agreement, if any, will be impacted by the additional recoupment obligation. In connection with the above issuance of our shares, we entered into a subscription agreement with Sony, effective as of January 17, 2017.
 
Our Products
 
Original Content
 
We own and produce original content that is meant to entertain and enrich toddlers to tweens as well as families. It is generally a three-year cycle from the inception of an idea, through production of the content and development and distribution of a range of consumer products to retail, creating an inevitable lag time between the creation of the intellectual property to the realization of economic benefit of those assets. Our goal is to maintain a robust and diverse portfolio of brands, appealing to various interests and ages, featuring evergreen topics with global appeal. Our portfolio of intellectual property can be licensed, re-licensed, and exploited for years to come, with revenue derived from multiple sources and territories. Our portfolio of original content includes:
Content in Production 
 
Llama Llama: We are currently in production on fifteen half-hour animated episodes to premiere on Netflix this year. Llama Llama’s creators include Oscar-winning director Rob Minkoff (The Lion King), director Saul Blinkoff (Doc McStuffins), showrunner Joe Purdy, art director Ruben Aquino (Frozen) and Emmy-winning producers Jane Startz and Andy Heyward. Based on the NY Times #1 best-selling children’s books of the same name, the animated series centers on young Llama Llama’s first steps in growing up and facing childhood milestones. Each episode will be structured around a childhood milestone coupled with a life lesson learned by Llama Llama and his friends, told with a sense of humor, vitality, and understanding. The global licensing program was unveiled in June 2016 at the Licensing Expo held in Las Vegas.
 
SpacePop: SpacePop is music and fashion driven animated property that has garnered over 14 million views and over 48,000 subscribers since its launch in May 2016. With 108 three-minute webisodes greenlit for production, SpacePop has a best-in-class development and production team on board including Steve Banks (head writer and story editor of Sponge Bob Square Pants) as content writer; Han Lee (Pink Fizz, Bobby Jack) for original character designs; multiple Grammy Award-winning producer and music veteran Ron Fair (Fergie, Mary J. Blige, Black Eyed Peas, Pussycat Dolls, Christina Aguilera and more), singer-songwriter Stefanie Fair (founding member of RCA’s girl group Wild Orchid with Fergie) for the original SpacePop theme music; and veteran music producer and composer John Loeffler (Kidz Bop, Pokemon) for original songs. Current promotional partners include Six Flags, Dippin’ Dots, and Camplified. We have collaborated with licensing partners throughout North America, including Taste Beauty (beauty and bath products), Bare Tree Media (emoticons), Canal Toys (craft and activity kits), Yowie Group, Ltd. (confections), Jaya Apparel (apparel), and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (home entertainment). Additionally, SpacePop products ranging from apparel and accessories, to beauty, cosmetics, candy, books and music became available at select Claire’s and Kohl’s in October 2016. We added a program at Toys “R” Us® in December 2016 with a dedicated feature space merchandising over 20 SpacePop items from our various licensees creating the ultimate SpacePop destination in time for the December 2016 holiday season.
 
Stan Lee’s Cosmic Crusaders: Stan Lee’s Cosmic Crusaders is a co-production between us, Stan Lee’s POW! Entertainment, and The Hollywood Reporter of an adult-themed animated series whose launch coincided with “Stan Lee’s 75 Years in Business” salute in The Hollywood Reporter’s Comic-Con issue. Stan Lee’s Cosmic Crusaders is based on a concept by Stan Lee and written by Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza. With 52 eleven-minute episodes greenlit for production, the first four episodes premiered exclusively on THR.com with one episode that aired during Comic-Con International 2016. Stan Lee’s Cosmic Crusaders is the first series to launch on THR.com and will be promoted through The Hollywood Reporter’s YouTube channel, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. The global consumer products program was introduced at Licensing Expo 2016 with national retailer Hot Topic secured as anchor retail partner.

Licensed Content 
 
Augmenting our original content, we act as an agent for established brands which attempts to maximize our existing infrastructure while creating incremental sources of revenue for us without additional overhead. These brands include From Frank, a popular line of greeting cards and Celessence Technologies, a microencapsulation technology that releases fragrance and is used to scent products.
 
Kid Genius Cartoon Channel 
 
In April 2015, we partnered with Comcast to launch the new Kid Genius Cartoon Channel on Xfinity on Demand. With Xfinity, Kid Genius Cartoon Channel is currently in over 22 million homes. In November 2016, we partnered with a leading kids’ app distributor adding Over-The-Top (“OTT”) distribution expanding the channel onto platforms such as Roku, Apple TV, Amazon and Google thus reaching an additional 20 million homes. Our plans are to continue this roll-out into 2017 adding additional reach with the goal of being in over 80 million homes. Kid Genius Cartoon Channel combines the powerful value of owning a channel in its own right with the ability to promote our brands and products.
Distribution
 
Content
 
Today’s global marketplace and the manner in which content is consumed has evolved to a point where we believe there is only one viable strategy, ubiquity. Kids today expect to be able to watch what they want whenever they want and wherever they want. They, the kids, are their own programmers and therefore as content creators we now must offer direct access on multiple fronts. This includes digital distribution as well as linear broadcast. We, through our partnership with Comcast’s Xfinity platform, launched the all-digital on demand network Kid Genius Cartoon Channel. Originally debuting in approximately 22 million households via Comcast, the reach of the Kid Genius Cartoon Channel and therefore all of the Genius Brands content expanded in November 2016 to approximately 42 million households through a distribution deal that brought Kid Genius Cartoon Channel into homes via AppleTV, Roku, Samsung TV, and Amazon Prime. In these homes, Genius Brands programs are always available to kids when they want it. Genius Brands also distributes its content via leading digital providers such as Netflix and Amazon giving additional instant availability to consumers of its shows.
 
We also have strong ties to and actively solicit placement for our content from the largest linear broadcasters such as Nickelodeon, The Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, Sprout, and PBS. Finally, we are a preferred partner of YouTube having successfully launched an original series with YouTube in May 2016 and making YouTube a focal point of the distribution of some of our shows. We replicate this model of ubiquity around the world defining content distribution strategies by market that blends the best of linear, VOD, and digital distribution.

Finally, we expanded our long term strategic partnership with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment from domestic to a global partnership in January 2017.
 
Consumer Products
 
A primary source of our revenue is our licensing and merchandising activities from our underlying intellectual property content. We work directly licensing properties to a variety of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. We currently have across all brands in excess of 50 licensees and hundreds of licensed products in the market. Products bearing our marks can be found in a wide variety of retail distribution outlets reaching consumers in over 10,000 retail doors. Our licensees sell to best in class retailers including Wal Mart, Target, Toys R Us, Claire’s, Kohl’s, Best Buy, Hudson News, Barnes & Noble, Amazon.com and many more. We often negotiate dedicated retail space on a direct basis with retailers that will include branded signage to give our brands prominence and clear communication with the consumer. License agreements that we enter into often include financial guarantees and commitments from the manufacturers guaranteeing a minimum stream of revenue for us. As licensed merchandise is sold at retail, these advances and/or minimum guarantees are paid out, and we then earn additional revenue.
Marketing
 
Genius Brands believes that generating awareness and consumer interest in our brands requires a dedicated 360 degree approach to marketing which we regularly deploy. Beyond the content creation and achieving distribution, consumers must become engaged with the content in all aspects of their lives. Successful marketing campaigns for our brands have included utilizing influencers (individuals with a strong, existing social media presence who drive awareness of our brands to their followers) and influencer marketing, participating in fast casual restaurant promotions, on-pack promotions with leading consumer packaged goods companies, and national live events at theme parks with companies like Six Flags. We also deploy digital and print advertising to support the brands. Finally, we work with a leading PR agency to promote our efforts to both consumer and trade. We regularly initiate grass roots marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships with brands that align and offer value to us. For the year 2016, our marketing efforts led to over 60 million impressions on behalf of our brands.
Competition
 
We compete against other creators of children’s content including Disney, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Sesame Street as well as other small and large creators. In the crowded children’s entertainment space, we compete with these other creators for both content distribution across linear, VOD, and digital platforms as well as retail shelf space for our licensed products. To compete, we are focused on our strategic positioning of “content with a purpose” which we believe is a point of differentiation embraced by the industry, as well as parents and educators. Additionally, the Kid Genius Cartoon Channel enables us to increase the awareness of our brands through an owned platform.
Customers and Licensees
 
Our business is not reliant on one or a few major customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had partnered with over 50 consumer products licensees going to market with over 500 stock keeping units (“SKU”). As of the same date, we licensed our content to over 20 broadcasters in nearly 90 territories globally as well as a number of VOD and online platforms that have a global reach. This broad cross-section of customers includes companies such as Comcast, Netflix, Sony, YouTube, Mattel, Toys R US, Target, Kohls, Claire’s, Penguin Publishing, Manhattan Toys, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon, Google, Bertelsmann Music Group, Discovery International, and others both domestically and internationally. In 2016, approximately 19% of our revenue was attributable to the recognition of revenues earned from one customer that paid advances in 2013 and 2014 for the administration of certain music publishing right on our behalf.
Government Regulation
 
The FCC requires broadcast networks to air a required number of hours of Educational and Informational content (E/I). We are subject to online distribution regulations, namely the FTC’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which regulates the collection of information of children younger than 13 years old.
 
We are currently subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally, including numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, enforcement and advertising of credit accounts, and limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider. Although credit to some of our customers is provided by third parties without recourse to us based upon a customer’s failure to pay, any restrictive change in the regulation of credit, including the imposition of, or changes in, interest rate ceilings, could adversely affect the cost or availability of credit to our customers and, consequently, our results of operations or financial condition.

Licensed toy products are subject to regulation under the Consumer Product Safety Act and regulations issued thereunder. These laws authorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) to protect the public from products which present a substantial risk of injury. The CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall such products. The CPSC may also impose fines or penalties on manufacturers or retailers. Similar laws exist in some states and other countries in which we plan to market our products. Although we do not manufacture and may not directly distribute toy products, a recall of any of the products may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 
We also maintain websites which include our corporate website located at www.gnusbrands.com, as well as www.spacepopgirls.com, www.kidgeniustv.com, www.babygenius.com, www.smckids.com, www.slam7.com, and www.edisonsecretlab.com. These websites are subject to laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications and commerce, which is a currently developing area of the law. The United States has enacted Internet laws related to children’s privacy, copyrights and taxation. However, laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled. The growth of the market for Internet commerce may result in more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that place additional burdens on companies conducting business over the Internet. We cannot predict with certainty what impact such laws will have on our business in the future.  In order to comply with new or existing laws regulating Internet commerce, we may need to modify the manner in which we conduct our website business, which may result in additional expense.
 
Because our products are manufactured by third parties and licensees, we are not significantly impacted by federal, state and local environmental laws and do not have significant costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 19 full-time equivalent employees and an additional seven temporary or contracted part-time or full-time equivalents in certain functions, such as legal, accounting and production management. We employ on an outsourced, as-needed basis, contractors in the fields of investor relations, public relations and production.
Intellectual Property
 
As of December 31, 2016, we own the following properties and related trademarks: Secret Millionaires Club, Thomas Edison’s Secret Lab, “Baby Genius”, “Kid Genius”, “Wee Worship”, “A Squared,” “Kaflooey,” and “Ready, Play, Learn” as well as several other names and trademarks on characters that had been developed for our content and brands. Additionally, we have trademark applications pending for Rainbow Rangers and SpacePop.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we hold 12 registered trademarks in multiple classes in the United States as well as additional trademarks in the United States that are associated with our other brands. We also have a number of registered and pending trademarks in Europe and other countries in which our products are sold.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we also held 96 motion picture, 13 sound recording and one literary work copyrights related to our video, music and written work products.
 
We have a two-third ownership interest in Stan Lee Comics, LLC which owns the publishing brand Stan Lee Comics and all properties produced therein. Stan Lee Comics, LLC is a joint venture with Stan Lee’s POW! Entertainment. Stan Lee Comics, LLC is the owner of the Stan Lee’s Mighty 7 property.
 
We have 50/50 ownership agreements with the following partners and their related brands: Martha Stewart’s Martha & Friends; and Gisele Bündchen’s Gisele & the Green Team.
 
In addition to the wholly-owned or partially-owned properties listed above, we have agreements with certain intellectual property owners to represent their content as a licensing agent. We act as a licensing agent for the following established brands: Llama Llama, From Frank, and Celessence Technologies.

Company Information
 
We were incorporated in California on January 3, 2006 and reincorporated in Nevada in October 2011. We commenced operations in January 2006, assuming all of the rights and obligations of our then Chief Executive Officer, under an Asset Purchase Agreement between the Company and Genius Products, Inc., in which we obtained all rights, copyrights, and trademarks to the brands “Baby Genius,” “Kid Genius,” “123 Favorite Music” and “Wee Worship,” and all then existing productions under those titles. In October 2011, we (i) changed our domicile to Nevada from California, and (ii) changed our name to Genius Brands International, Inc. from Pacific Entertainment Corporation (the “Reincorporation”). In connection with the Reincorporation, we changed our trading symbol from “PENT” to “GNUS.”
 
On November 15, 2013, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with A Squared Entertainment LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“A Squared”), A Squared Holdings LLC, a California limited liability company and the sole member of A Squared (the “Parent Member”), and A2E Acquisition LLC, its newly formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary (“Acquisition Sub”). Upon closing of the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement (the “Merger”), which occurred concurrently with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Acquisition Sub merged with and into A Squared, and A Squared, as the surviving entity, became our wholly-owned subsidiary.  As a result of the Merger, we acquired the business and operations of A Squared.
