We seek solutions that maximize performance in transformative aerospace and defense systems and high-speed communications networks. Our manufacturing approach is focused on the highest standards of precision that enable us to deliver leading-edge products. 
Customers
We have an increasingly global customer base that spans applications across telecommunications and CATV network infrastructure, satellite communications, defense, and aerospace. Major customers include: Cisco Systems Inc., Commscope Holding Company, Inc., and Raytheon Company and their respective affiliates, each of whom represented greater than 10% of consolidated revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. See Note 13 – Segment and Revenue Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about significant customers.
Sales and Marketing
We sell products worldwide through multiple channels made up of our direct sales force, application engineers, third party sales representatives, and distributors. Our sales force is aligned according to product line to maximize expertise. We communicate with customers’ engineering, manufacturing, and purchasing personnel throughout the sales cycle to provide optimized customer solutions through product design, qualifications, performance, and price. As a result, we develop strategic and long-lasting customer relationships with tailored products and services. Marketing efforts are focused on increasing brand awareness, communicating our technological advantages, and generating leads. We use a variety of marketing methods, including our website, participation at trade shows, and selective advertising to achieve these goals.
Manufacturing
We utilize MOCVD systems capable of processing a wide range of compound semiconductor-based materials. Operations include wafer fabrication, device design and production, fiber optic module, subsystem and system design and manufacture,  and QMEMS gyroscope, accelerometer, and IMU and INS design and manufacture. Operations beyond wafer fabrication are already largely and increasingly manufactured with our electronics manufacturing services ("EMS") partners. We are to a large extent vertically integrated in the manufacture of QMEMS gyroscopes, accelerometers, inertial measurement units and inertial navigation systems design and manufacture within our own facilities. Many of our manufacturing operations are computer monitored or controlled to enhance production output and statistical control. 
We seek to minimize ongoing capital investments, while maximizing the variable nature of our cost structure. Where cost advantages can be gained, we continue to outsource the production of certain products, subsystems, components, and subassemblies to contract manufacturers ("CMs") located domestically or overseas. For example, we are in the process of transitioning our CATV Lasers and Transmitters product line from in-house manufacturing in Beijing, China, to a variable cost, EMS model as described in Part II, Item 7 Recent Developments, "Hytera and Fastrain Transactions".
Our manufacturing processes involve extensive quality assurance systems and performance testing. Our CMs also maintain comprehensive quality assurance and delivery systems that are monitored for compliance. Our facilities have achieved and continue to maintain certification status for quality management systems. Manufacturing facilities located in Alhambra, California and Beijing, China are registered to ISO 9001 standards and the Concord, California facility is registered to AS 9100 standards. 
Research and Development
Our industry is characterized by rapid changes in process technologies with increasing levels of functional integration. To that end, research and development efforts focus on maintaining our technological competitive edge to improve the quality and features of existing products. We strive to design new proprietary production technologies and products, improving the performance of existing materials, components, and subsystems, and reducing costs in the product manufacturing process. 
Many projects have focused on developing lower cost versions of our existing products. In view of the high cost of development, we solicit research contracts that provide opportunities to enhance our core technology base and promote the commercialization of targeted products.
Supplier Relationships
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, and equipment. Supplier relationships are reviewed to mitigate risks and lower costs, especially where we depend on a few suppliers for critical components or raw materials. Communications with suppliers are ongoing to prevent interruptions and our supply-chain management is focused on maintaining quality while lowering purchase prices through standardized purchasing efficiencies and design requirements. We strive to limit inventories to levels sufficient to meet near-term needs.
We are subject to rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding the use of "conflict minerals". These rules have imposed and will continue to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the ability to verify the origin of any "conflict minerals" used in our products.
Competition
The markets we serve are extremely competitive, characterized by rapid technological change. Primary competitive factors are product cost, yield, throughput, performance, reliability, breadth of product line, product heritage, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty to competitors’ technologies. Certain product lines are subject to frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, and significant price erosion. We face competition from numerous domestic and international companies, who may have significant engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and financial resources. In addition, competitors may develop enhancements to, or future generations of, products that offer superior price and performance characteristics.
Although our markets are competitive, there are substantial barriers to entry. These barriers include significant dependence on existing patents, the time and costs required to develop products, the technical difficulty in manufacturing semiconductor-based products, the lengthy sales and qualification cycles, and the difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled employees with the required scientific and technical backgrounds. 
We sell products to current and future potential competitors. As the markets for our products grow, new competitors are likely to emerge and current competitors may increase their market share. In the European Union ("EU") and certain countries throughout the world, political and legal arrangements encourage the purchase of domestically produced goods, which places us at a disadvantage in those regions or countries. 
Order Backlog
Our product sales are made pursuant to purchase orders, in some cases with short lead times. These orders are typically subject to revision or cancellation and can be made without deposits. Historically, for our CATV Lasers and Transmitters product line, products have typically shipped within the same quarter in which a purchase order is received, and therefore order backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period and may not be comparable to prior periods.
Seasonality
In certain previous fiscal years, we have experienced an increase in revenues in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to increased sales of our CATV Lasers and Transmitters product line resulting from an increased build of cable networks during seasons with warmer weather.
Intellectual Property and Licensing
We protect our proprietary technology by applying for patents to preserve the technology, related know-how, and information as trade secrets. The success and competitive advantage of certain product lines depends heavily on the ability to obtain intellectual property protection for proprietary technologies. We also rely on other intellectual property rights such as trademarks and copyrights where appropriate and acquire, through license grants or assignments, the rights to patents on inventions originally developed by others. We do not believe financial obligations under any of these agreements adversely affects our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
As of September 30, 2021, we held approximately 56 U.S. patents and approximately 66 foreign patents and approximately four additional patent applications pending. The issued patents cover various products in the major markets we serve. Our U.S. patents will expire on varying dates between 2021 and 2038. These patents and patent applications claim protection for various aspects of current or planned commercial versions of our materials, components, subsystems, and systems.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment, emission, release, discharge, and disposal of certain materials used in research and development and production operations, as well as laws and regulations concerning environmental remediation, homeland security, and employee health and safety. The production of wafers and devices involves the use of certain hazardous raw materials, including, but not limited to, ammonia, phosphine, and arsine. We have in-house professionals to address compliance with applicable environmental, homeland security, and health and safety laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental protection laws and regulations.
Human Capital
Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is essential to continued success. Competition is intense in recruiting personnel within the semiconductor and fiber optics industries. We are focused on retaining key contributors, developing staff, 
and cultivating their continued commitment. As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 365 employees, including approximately 75 international employees that are located primarily in China. This represents a decrease of approximately 22 employees when compared to September 30, 2020. We believe that employee relations are good. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any labor-related work stoppage.
