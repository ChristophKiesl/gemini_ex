Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing transformative cell therapies for patients with cancer, infectious diseases and other serious conditions. We use our proprietary technology, Cell Squeeze, to physically squeeze cells through a microfluidic chip, temporarily opening the cell membrane and enabling biologic material of interest, or cargo, to diffuse into the cell. This technology allows us to create a broad pipeline of product candidates for different diseases. We believe our Cell Squeeze technology has the potential to create well-tolerated cell therapies that can provide therapeutic benefit for patients. Our potential benefits include accelerated timelines with production time under 24 hours, compared to four to six weeks for other existing cell therapies, improved patient experience by eliminating the need for pre-conditioning or lengthy hospital stays, reduced toxicity concerns by leveraging physiological mechanisms, and broadened therapeutic impact. Our goal is to use the SQZ approach to establish a new paradigm for cell therapies. We are using Cell Squeeze to create multiple cell therapy platforms focused on directing specific immune responses. Our most advanced platform in development, SQZ Antigen Presenting Cells, or SQZ APCs, is currently in a Phase 1 trial in HPV+ tumors. Our additional platforms currently in development are SQZ Activating Antigen Carriers, or SQZ AACs, for which an investigational new drug application, or IND, was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in January 2021 for SQZ-AAC-HPV, a cell therapy candidate generated from red blood cells engineered with tumor-specific antigen to treat HPV+ tumors, and SQZ Tolerizing Antigen Carriers, or SQZ TACs. We are leveraging each of these platforms to create differentiated product candidates that have applicability across multiple disease areas. 
 Our SQZ APC platform is focused on generating robust CD8+ T cell (CD8, CD8 T cell) responses, which are known to be critical to powerful immune responses. We believe that the keys to driving responses are the quantity, quality and specificity of the CD8+ T cells that are generated. In preclinical studies, the SQZ APC platform has shown approximately 1,000 times more efficient CD8+ T cell activation compared to other cancer vaccine approaches and has also shown that these T cells are specific to the target antigen. SQZ APCs have shown encouraging anti-tumor activity and the ability to elicit protective memory preclinically, indications of the quality of the CD8+ T cells produced. We have also shown in preclinical studies the ability of SQZ APCs to elicit specific immune responses for multiple target antigens, including highly immunogenic (HPV) and less immunogenic (mutant KRAS) antigens. 
 Our lead product candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, from our SQZ APC platform, is a targeted cancer vaccine that has been designed to generate antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses to attack HPV+ tumors. We believe there remains significant unmet need in HPV+ cancers, with over 630,000 new cases every year globally. 
 We are evaluating SQZ-PBMC-HPV in a Phase 1 clinical trial as a monotherapy and in combination with other immuno-oncology agents for the treatment of HPV16+ advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including cervical, head-and-neck, anal, penile, vulvar and vaginal cancer. The primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose, if any, or maximum administered dose and to define a dose for the expansion cohort and future trials. We are currently enrolling patients in the monotherapy portion of the trial, which includes multiple cohorts of different doses and dosing schedules. As of December 31, 2020, we had dosed 12 patients. This includes three patients in the low-dose monotherapy cohort, five patients in the high-dose monotherapy cohort, and four patients in a high-dose, double-priming monotherapy cohort. We expect to initiate the combination portion of the trial in mid-2021 and anticipate data from combination cohorts in 2022. The total number of patients enrolled will depend on safety and observed immunogenic effects. We can expand the trial to treat additional monotherapy or combination cohorts of patients or expand cohorts that show clinical benefit. If we expand the trial, we may enroll up to a total of 200 patients. Unlike certain other oncology cell therapies, patients in the clinical trial receive no pre-conditioning, and we plan for the treatment to be administered without post-treatment hospitalization. There had been no treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events and no dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, observed as of December 31, 2020. All doses in the trial have been manufactured in under 24 hours and each patient had successful manufacturing of their SQZ APCs. We are encouraged by the safety data and manufacturing we have seen to date as well as the initial biomarker data from the low-dose cohort, which showed early signs of intratumoral immune activity. We expect to present more comprehensive biomarker data from patients in the monotherapy cohorts at a scientific conference in mid-2021. 
 
The SQZ APC platform for oncology is being developed as a part of our collaboration with Roche, a relationship that began in 2015 and was subsequently expanded in 2018 to include a broader cell source to create SQZ APCs, and co-development and co-commercialization terms. The 2018 expanded collaboration agreement includes $125 million in upfront payments and near-term milestone payments, significant cost sharing, royalties, and over $1 billion in potential future payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales milestones. The timing of these future milestone payments will depend on the clinical development and commercialization of our SQZ APC product candidates, and we may not receive any or all of these milestone payments. To date, we have received $94 million in upfront and near-term milestone payments from our collaboration agreements with Roche, of which $75 million was received under the 2018 expanded collaboration. Our collaboration with Roche provides us with access to many potential combination drugs, including their PD-L1 drug, atezolizumab. See “—Collaboration, Research and License Agreements—Roche Collaboration.” 
 Beyond oncology, we are also applying the SQZ APC platform to infectious diseases. As with SQZ APCs for oncology, this approach has the potential to induce an endogenous CD8 T cell-driven immune response targeted against a pathogen of interest, in both prophylactic and therapeutic patient settings. In preclinical studies, we have observed SQZ APCs’ ability to generate responses against multiple infectious disease antigens, including hepatitis B virus, or HBV, cytomegalovirus, or CMV, influenza A and simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV, 
 3

the non-human primate form of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. We expect to submit our first IND to the FDA from the infectious disease platform in 2022 for the treatment of HBV. While we are initially developing this platform to potentially provide a curative vaccine for chronic diseases, we believe the SQZ-APC approach could also enable rapid response vaccines in the face of seasonal or new emerging outbreaks. 
 Our second oncology platform, SQZ AACs, applies our Cell Squeeze technology to create Antigen Carriers from red blood cells (RBCs). SQZ AACs then leverage a similar process to eryptosis, the natural clearing of aged RBCs, in order to drive powerful activation of patients’ endogenous T cells. Our first SQZ AAC IND in oncology for HPV+ tumors was cleared by the FDA in January 2021 and we expect initial monotherapy data in house by the end of 2021. While our first product candidate from our SQZ AAC platform is autologous, meaning it uses a patient’s own red blood cells, we believe an allogeneic approach is possible in the future, allowing us to potentially create off-the-shelf therapeutics. Our second preclinical product candidate for our SQZ AAC platform targets specific oncogenic KRAS mutations, which are found in approximately 30% of all human cancers in the United States. Historically, targeting mutant KRAS proteins with small molecules has been challenging due to a lack of “druggable” binding pockets. Recently, selective third-party inhibitors of certain KRAS mutations, namely G12C, have demonstrated encouraging preliminary anti-tumor effects, providing clinical validation for targeting mutant KRAS for the treatment of cancer. However, the majority of KRAS mutations remain out of reach for small molecules. In preclinical studies, we have been able to elicit responses to KRAS G12D and G12V mutations with our cellular vaccine platforms, which together represent over 50% of KRAS mutations, four times that of G12C. There are approximately 100,000 patients per year in the United States with KRAS G12D and G12V mutations across multiple tumor types, including pancreatic, colorectal and some lung cancers. We plan to submit an IND for SQZ AACs to treat KRAS-mutated tumors in 2022. 
 Our third platform, SQZ TACs, applies our Cell Squeeze technology to create Antigen Carriers that leverage a similar cell clearance process as SQZ AACs but as an approach for generating immune tolerance. In preclinical models, we have shown the capability to increase regulatory T cells, which suppress the immune system, and shut down other immune stimulatory drivers such as effector T cells and antibody responses. The SQZ TAC platform is potentially applicable to many autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, as well as other applications with unwanted immune responses, such as antibody responses against biologics or gene therapy vectors. We plan to select a first indication and initiate IND-enabling studies with SQZ TACs in 2021.

 We believe product candidates from our SQZ platforms could offer meaningful benefits for patients by providing potential efficacy and safety, as well as a better patient experience compared to existing cell therapies. Recently approved cell therapies have advanced the treatment paradigm in disease areas such as cancer; however, many treatments remain challenged by various factors, including limited therapeutic applicability, a burdensome patient experience, such as pre-conditioning and hospitalization, as well as manufacturing, operational, and scaling challenges. We believe the current SQZ platforms and the future evolution of our platforms can offer many advantages over existing cell therapy approaches. Some of these advantages are outlined in the graphic below.

Company History 
 Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Armon Sharei, is the lead inventor of Cell Squeeze, which is based on his team’s work in the laboratories of Dr. Klavs Jensen and Dr. Robert Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a series of experiments with a complex, high-pressure, fluid-jet delivery system, the team discovered that simple, rapid, mechanical deformation of cells enables intracellular delivery of biomaterials. The team created the SQZ microfluidic chip specifically designed to exploit this phenomenon. Through collaboration with leading scientists in the immunology and regenerative medicine fields, the team discovered the process’ novel capabilities and potential for significant impact through robust engineering of cell therapies. SQZ Biotechnologies was founded with the goal of realizing the broad potential of this technology and establishing a new paradigm for cell therapies as effective, safe treatments to impact the lives of patients around the world. 
 SQZ Strategy 
 Our goal is to build a fully integrated cell therapy company leveraging the Cell Squeeze technology to develop differentiated, transformative product candidates for patients across a broad range of disease areas. To enable a future with impactful SQZ cell therapy products as a compelling early-line treatment option for patients, we are executing a strategy with the following key elements: 
  
∎ | Advance our lead product candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, in HPV16+ tumors through clinical development. SQZ-PBMC-HPV, the first implementation of our SQZ APC platform, is engineered by squeezing a patient’s own peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, with defined HPV16+ tumor antigens to create tumor-targeted APCs. SQZ-PBMC-HPV is designed to induce robust endogenous CD8+ T cell activation against HPV+ cancer cells. In collaboration with Roche, we are evaluating SQZ-PBMC-HPV in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with HPV16+ advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The trial is designed with monotherapy and combination therapy cohorts. We are currently dosing patients in the monotherapy cohorts and expect to present more comprehensive biomarker data from patients in the monotherapy cohorts at a scientific conference in mid-2021. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Enhance the SQZ APC platform by incorporating additional functionality and making it applicable to a broader patient population. We are encouraged by initial observations and progress in the ongoing Phase 1 trial of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in HPV+ tumors. Our enhanced APC (or eAPC) program is designed to build on this progress by leveraging the cargo flexibility of the Cell Squeeze technology to create next generation product candidates. There are multiple signals that contribute to effective CD8+ T cell activation. We are designing our eAPCs using multiple mRNA cargos to potentially enhance signals 2 & 3, as well as to prolong antigen presentation and remove HLA restrictions potentially improving on signal 1. The eAPC platform advancements would be potentially applicable across future oncology and infectious disease products. We plan to report preclinical data from our next-generation SQZ APCs at a scientific meeting in the first half of 2021 and plan to submit an IND for this program to the FDA by the end of 2021. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Broaden our oncology pipeline through the development of SQZ AACs. The Cell Squeeze technology enables us to utilize a wide range of cell types and antigens to create novel cell therapy candidates. In addition to our SQZ APC oncology platform, we are focused on expanding our oncology pipeline using our wholly owned SQZ AAC platform. Our first SQZ AAC IND in oncology to treat HPV+ tumors was cleared by the FDA in January 2021. We are also developing product candidates using other tumor antigens, such as mutant KRAS. We have generated preclinical data from our SQZ APC and AAC programs that showed our ability to generate robust CD8+ T cell responses with multiple tumor antigens. We are conducting preclinical studies on our SQZ AAC program, targeting KRAS G12D and G12V mutations. There are approximately 100,000 patients per year in the United States with KRAS G12D and G12V mutations across multiple tumor types, including pancreatic, colorectal and some lung cancers. We plan to submit an IND to the FDA in 2022 for SQZ AACs to treat KRAS-mutated tumors.

∎ | Progress our infectious disease pipeline into clinical development. We are leveraging our progress with SQZ APCs in oncology to expand into infectious diseases. For infectious disease, we are developing SQZ APCs with pathogen-specific antigens to generate targeted immune responses. We have generated preclinical data for SQZ APCs targeting HBV, CMV, SIV and influenza that demonstrated SQZ APCs’ ability to generate robust CD8+ T cell responses across multiple targets. We plan to initially develop SQZ APCs for chronic infectious diseases and expect to submit our first IND to the FDA from the infectious disease platform in 2022 for the treatment of HBV. While we are initially developing this platform to develop a potentially curative vaccine for chronic diseases, we believe the SQZ APC approach could also enable rapid response vaccines in the face of seasonal or new emerging outbreaks. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Utilize our SQZ TAC platform to address autoimmune and other diseases. We are developing our SQZ TAC platform, which leverages antigen presentation to create immune tolerance, in multiple indications. Our approach is focused on generating antigen-specific tolerance and exploring the potential of TACs to treat multiple diseases. We believe the SQZ TAC platform is potentially applicable to many autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, as well as other applications with unwanted immune responses, such as antibody responses against biologics or gene therapy vectors. We plan to select an indication and execute IND-enabling studies for our first application with the TAC platform in 2021. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Invest in our manufacturing capabilities and advance our point-of-care system. We have developed a proprietary, rapid and cost-efficient central cGMP manufacturing process for our product candidates, which is a critical driver of our long-term success. The system we have created is applicable across all of our SQZ platforms with minor customization changes. The production time for our lead product candidates, SQZ-PBMC-HPV and SQZ-AAC-HPV, are under 24 hours with a vein-to-vein time of approximately one week. We plan to continue to invest resources to refine our existing manufacturing process with the goal of further reducing manufacturing time and cost. We are also developing a point-of-care system that could generate doses at 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the treatment center, thus creating a better patient experience. We anticipate the initial prototype of the point-of-care system will begin non-clinical tests in the second half of 2021.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Opportunistically collaborate with strategic partners to realize the full potential of the Cell Squeeze technology. While we intend to establish our own fully integrated internal capabilities to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we may selectively pursue and form strategic collaborations or partnerships in order to accelerate our development timelines, broaden the therapeutic reach of our SQZ platforms and maximize the full potential of the Cell Squeeze technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SQZ Technology 
 Generating cell therapy candidates with the Cell Squeeze technology is simple, as illustrated below: we physically squeeze cells at high speeds through a microfluidic constriction to temporarily disrupt the cell membrane and enable the target cargo to enter directly into the cytosol. The elegance of our system enables us to process over 10 billion patient cells per minute at current clinical scale and introduce virtually any cargo of interest into any cell type to create what we believe to be an unprecedented range of potential therapeutics. Our unique technology and its products are covered by over 30 patent families. 
 
SQZ Differentiation 
 Limitations of Current Cell Therapies 
 Recently approved cell therapies have advanced the cancer treatment paradigm in certain therapeutic applications; however, efforts to expand into new disease areas have been constrained due to the limitations of cell-engineering approaches, such as lengthy and expensive manufacturing, overall patient safety and efficacy concerns, and limited biological applicability beyond initial indications. 
Breadth of Impact 
  
∎ | Limited therapeutic applications. Electroporation and viral techniques, the most commonly used methods for engineering cell therapies, are limited in both the diversity of cargo that can be introduced into cells and the cell types that can be manipulated. Both these techniques are primarily suitable for delivering nucleic acids into certain cell types and have difficulty delivering other materials, such as proteins and small molecules. These limitations restrict the functions that can be engineered into cells and, consequently, the diseases that can be treated with cell therapies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Limited access to biology. Despite the recent advances in implementing cell therapies for oncology, these products have relied on a narrow set of biological mechanisms limiting their therapeutic applicability to date. For example, most chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and T-cell receptor, or TCR, products rely on genetic changes to effector cells to generate tumor killing and these therapies have only been approved in B cell malignancies. Most current tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TIL, products do not directly engineer cell functions but simply expand T cells ex vivo to provide more cells. The field has been constrained to effector cell manipulation, narrowing the range of targetable tumors, forcing the need for pre-conditioning, limiting memory formation, and can result in variable clinical responses and significant tolerability issues. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Experience 
  
∎ | Significant safety concerns. Considerable concerns remain regarding the safety and side effects of current cell therapies. For example, serious, life-threatening side effects have been reported for CAR-T cell therapies, including severe cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicities, serious infections, low blood cell counts and a weakened immune system. These side effects are, in part, due to the blunt force of these treatments, which unleash an artificial and engineered immune response in patients that is difficult to control. Additionally, the pre-conditioning required ahead of treatment with these therapies can lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous outcomes. As a result, these treatments are considered riskier than earlier line chemotherapy and radiation and patients often face significant hospitalization time to undergo treatment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

∎ | Unintended impact to cell function. Methods of cell engineering, such as electroporation or viral engineering, have been shown to cause significant downstream biological consequences to cell function. Electroporated cells have shown dysregulation of many key genes and functional pathways as measured through transcriptome, protein and functional profiling. Viral engineering is also known to cause significant changes in biology and cellular behavior. These biological changes could potentially lead to the loss of a cell’s physiological activity and may impact the potency, efficacy and safety of cell therapies that rely on these methods. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing 
  
∎ | Operational and scaling challenges. The high production time and costs associated with current cell therapies are significant challenges to making these treatments accessible and effective across many patients. This cost is driven mostly by the complexity and extended manufacturing time. The time that elapses between apheresis and product delivery at the hospital is commonly referred to as “vein-to-vein” time. Typical vein-to-vein time for treating cancer patients using autologous T cell therapy is approximately four to six weeks and involves many steps and complex logistics. This drives the high cost of current cell therapies, increases the risk of batch failures, and poses a problem for late-stage patients with limited time given the rapid progression of disease. We believe that this intensive and costly process is a major impediment to effectively scaling production of cell therapies and justifying their use for earlier lines of treatment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SQZ Solution 
 We believe the following characteristics highly differentiate our Cell Squeeze approach from existing cell therapies: 
 Breadth of Impact 
  
∎ | Translation across cell types. Our technology has been compatible with the over 25 mammalian cell types that we have tested to date. We have created a library of SQZ chips optimized for a variety of cell populations that can be easily optimized for use in our manufacturing systems. We believe this broad translatability expands the indications that we can consider targeting and also avoids costly cell expansion steps by allowing us to use cells that are easier to access, but historically difficult to engineer, such as stem cells and immune cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Material agnostic. Our technology is generally agnostic to cargo material. We have achieved the intracellular delivery of peptides, proteins, small molecules, nucleic acids and gene-editing complexes. Many of these material classes, such as proteins and peptides, have been difficult to deliver with existing techniques. In addition, we have been able to simultaneously deliver multiple different materials into cells, enabling us to multiplex engineer several cellular functions in a single squeeze. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Access to novel biology. Our technology allows us to access novel biology that was previously not possible due to the inability to deliver cargo to the cytosolic compartment cells. As an example of novel biology we have accessed, in our SQZ APC platform, our technology is capable of directly engineering major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, Class I presentation and co-stimulation in a physiologically relevant manner to generate potent CD8+ T cell responses. This illustrates our ability to access immune functions upstream of the effector cells that current cell therapies are focused on and potentially result in a physiological immune response with higher specificity, potency and durability. By accessing these mechanisms, SQZ technology also likely eliminates the need for pre-conditioning and genetic alteration of cells. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Experience 
  
∎ | Potential for safer and more impactful products by mimicking physiological mechanisms. We believe the versatility of Cell Squeeze allows us to approach mechanisms without disrupting other normal physiology. By doing this, we avoid pre-conditioning patients and expect our therapeutic candidates to be well tolerated. We believe that this, coupled with our cost-effective manufacturing, create the potential for SQZ therapeutic candidates to move up into earlier lines of therapy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Addressing fundamental disease drivers. By enabling broad engineering of cell biology, the SQZ technology has allowed us to design therapeutics that target the underlying drivers of disease. In our oncology programs, for example, the CD8+ T cell responses generated by our SQZ APC and AAC platforms are capable of targeting the underlying driver mutations that result in cancer, such as HPV E6 and E7 or KRAS mutants. In contrast, CAR-T mechanisms target non-tumor driving antigens, such as CD19, CD20 or BCMA. We believe the ability to target the underlying drivers of disease enables us to create more impactful and more tolerable therapies that are broadly applicable. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Minimal unintended cell perturbation providing optimum cell health. To date, our technology has not adversely affected normal cell genotype, phenotype or function in preclinical models, which we believe could translate to improved efficacy and fewer undesired effects. In the context of human T cells and hematopoietic stem cells, for example, we observed gene expression patterns close to normal, while alternatives, such as electroporation, result in dramatic misregulation of gene expression. Moreover, our existing platforms do not rely on genetic alterations to cells thereby eliminating long-term safety concerns arising from unintended consequences to DNA disruption. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing 
  
∎ | Production and administration. The production time for our current product candidates is under 24 hours, with a vein-to-vein time of approximately one week, compared to current cell therapies, which can have vein-to-vein times of four to six weeks. The SQZ product candidate is then administered to the patient via a simple syringe push. We are also developing a point-of-care system that we expect will further reduce this vein-to-vein time and provide the ability to create a patient product at the treatment center. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8

 
∎ | Scalability. We believe that the simplicity of the microfluidic system that squeezes cells allows for robust parallelization and scale up. In its current clinical manufacturing implementation, the core component of our technology is our SQZ chip, which is approximately the size of a postage stamp and is made up of hundreds of parallel channels that enable it to process up to 10 billion patient cells per minute. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Cost efficiency. We believe that eliminating the need for viral vectors and multi-day manufacturing could dramatically cut costs relative to current cell therapies and enable expansion into areas where current cell-engineering approaches are cost prohibitive. We anticipate manufacturing costs for SQZ-PBMC-HPV will be approximately 10 times lower per dose at commercial scale compared to currently marketed cell therapies. In future iterations, the point-of-care system could potentially reduce costs even further. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQZ Cell Therapy Platforms 
 To date, we have leveraged Cell Squeeze to build three cell therapy platforms that we are applying to multiple therapeutic areas. These platforms are designed to modulate the immune system in a target-specific manner with initial applications in oncology, infectious disease and immune disorders. Our SQZ platforms are designed to be able to manufacture product candidates in under 24 hours and administered without any pre-conditioning and without any planned hospitalization, creating what we believe is a more streamlined, accessible patient experience and a lower burden on the health system, from a time and cost perspective. Our current cell therapy platforms are summarized in the table below. 

 | SQZ Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) | SQZ ACTIVATING ANTIGENCARRIERS (AACs) | SQZ TOLERIZING ANTIGENCARRIERS (TACs) 
Current Indications Under Development | Cancer—Solid and liquid tumor Infectious diseases | Cancer—Solid and liquid tumors | Autoimmune diseases and tolerance applications 
Initial Cell Type | PBMCs* | RBCs** | RBCs** 
Cell Source | Autologous | Autologous; potential for allogeneic | Autologous; potential for allogeneic 
Candidate Description | PBMCs are squeezed with tumor or infectious disease specific antigens to generate SQZ APCs. Cytosolic delivery of the antigens enables robust MHC-I presentation of the target and drives activation of the patient’s endogenous CD8+ T cells against tumor cells or infected cells | RBCs are squeezed with tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant to generate SQZ AACs. The product is designed to be rapidly engulfed in vivo by the patient’s endogenous professional antigen presenting cells. This drives activation of the patient’s endogenous CD8+ T cells against the tumor | RBCs are squeezed with a disease-specific antigen to generate SQZ TACs. The product is designed to be rapidly engulfed in vivo by the patient’s endogenous professional antigen presenting cells. This drives tolerization of the patient’s T cell and antibody responses against the target
Mechanism of Action | Activate disease-specific T cell responses using ex vivo engineered APCs | Activate tumor-specific T cell responses using endogenous, professional antigen presenting cells | Suppress endogenous antigen-specific immune responses using tolerogenic presentation by professional antigen presenters 
Patient Experience | No pre-conditioning or planned hospitalization across programs 
Manufacturing Time | Under 24 hours to create multiple doses. Compatible with point-of-care implementation

Cell Squeeze Technology Enables the Interchangeability of Cargo and Versatile Target Selection 
 Our cell therapy platforms are focused on modulating immune responses targeting disease-specific antigens. The SQZ APC and SQZ AAC platforms are designed to activate immune cells against the target antigens and drive killing of specific diseased cells, while in contrast, the SQZ TAC platform is designed to tolerize against the target antigen. Although each platform has demonstrated robust activity across antigens and our strategy includes leveraging Cell Squeeze’s capability to insert cargos interchangeably, antigen selection is a defining factor for each individual product.

To select the appropriate antigen for a given product candidate, we consider multiple factors, including: 
  
∎ | Unmet Medical Need: The patient population potentially impacted by the antigen-specific product must have a significant unmet need.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Disease Driver: The antigen for a given product must be associated with driving the disease. For example, driving mutations in a tumor, such as E6 and E7 for HPV, tend to be critical to the tumor cells malignant behavior.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Safety: The antigen must be specific to the disease and minimize potential for complications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While many diseases have common antigens that can be used as a target across the patient population, there are significant unmet medical needs that would be better addressed by a personalized approach. In this context, we believe we can leverage the cargo flexibility of the SQZ platforms to create personalized therapies. For example, in oncology the field has developed many approaches to identify personalized neoantigens. We could use the same process for our SQZ APCs or AACs to deliver a personalized set of neoantigens and create a patient-specific product. We believe the modularity of our SQZ platforms allows us to potentially address many indications using the same underlying mechanism by targeting both common and personalized antigens. 
 SQZ Antigen Presenting Cells (APC) Platform 
 SQZ APC Platform Overview 
 We are focused on generating powerful CD8+ T cell responses with the SQZ APC platform. CD8+ T cells are known to be critical to anti-tumor and anti-pathogen responses. Moreover, by mimicking the actions of the immune system and generating powerful responses we believe SQZ APCs also elicit protective immune memory. Immunological memory is the ability of the immune system to quickly and specifically recognize an antigen that the body has previously encountered and initiate a corresponding immune response. The potential significance for patients could mean preventing recurrence of disease or protection from future infection. 
 In order to generate an immune response, CD8+ T cells require robust antigen presentation on MHC Class I by APCs to become activated. Antigens for presentation on MHC Class I are primarily sourced from the cytosol. Traditionally, cell therapies and vaccine systems targeting antigen presentation have relied on APCs endocytosing the target material. Endocytosis is the process by which cells engulf material, resulting in the material being segregated from the cytosol in an endosome. This results primarily in MHC Class II presentation and subsequent CD4+ helper T cell activation. Through a process referred to as cross-presentation as shown below, a small amount of endosomal material can be presented on MHC Class I to yield some CD8+ T cell activation. However, this process is inefficient, resulting in suboptimal anti-tumor activity or viral protection. SQZ APCs on the other hand can access MHC Class I directly, bypassing the need for cross presentation. 
 Antigen Presentation: MHC Class I vs. MHC Class II

SQZ APCs are created by engineering a patient’s own PBMCs with specific antigens to develop ex vivo antigen presenting cells that, when administered to the patient, are designed to drive activation and proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo. PBMCs include a mixed population of T cells, B cells, natural killer, or NK, cells and monocytes. 
 We believe that our unique capability to deliver antigen to the cell cytosol enhances MHC Class I presentation and subsequent CD8+ T cell activation relative to other approaches that rely on cross-presentation. In preclinical studies of our SQZ APCs, we have observed presentation of antigen on MHC Class I 1,000 times more efficiently than observed through cross-presentation (endocytosis via incubation), as shown in the graph below. 
 SQZ Drives CD8+ T cell Activation 1,000 Times More Efficiently Compared to Cross-Presentation 
 
Antigen presentation is the body’s natural mechanism for activating immune responses in many disease contexts, including oncology and infectious diseases. When evaluating immune therapies in oncology, literature has shown that in effective treatments, clinical responses have correlated directly with CD8+ T cell responses and infiltration into patient tumors. To address the underlying challenges of prior approaches in immune therapies in both oncology and infectious disease, we expect our SQZ APC platform to improve: 
 Quantity:    Achieve sufficient proliferation of activated T cells due to the natural expansion process that T cells undergo in vivo after stimulation by an APC 
 Specificity:    Drive antigen-specific responses by engineering APCs with precise disease-specific antigens of interest while avoiding broad stimulation of other undesirable responses 
 Quality:    Create healthy cells that can leverage the body’s natural T cell activation process to generate functional T cell responses 
 We believe that our approach addresses each of these areas and therefore has advantages over approaches including CAR-T, TCR, TIL and vaccines, all which face challenges in at least one of these areas. 
Quantity 
 Demonstrating the high quantity of T cells and their activation by SQZ PBMC, in a preclinical study we measured activation and absolute numbers of T cells after exposure to SQZ PBMCs. In this study shown below, we squeezed PBMCs with OVA, a common antigen used to measure immune response, and evaluated OT-I activation, the transgenic CD8+ T cells specific to OVA in mouse models, as measured by CD69 protein. We also evaluated CD8+ T cell activation across PBMCs, including T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes. We observed that the cells squeezed with OVA activated CD8+ T cells in high percentages, while OT-I CD8+ T cells alone and cells squeezed with no antigen did not activate responses at all, suggesting that the squeezed cells were efficiently presenting the antigen and generating a high proportion of T cells to respond. Since our SQZ APC platform is capable of inserting antigen directly into the cytosol, we are able to engineer all PBMC cell types into APCs to create a greater quantity of active CD8+ T cells. We believe this capability eliminates the need for the cell sorting and expansion that is necessary for cell therapy approaches that require a specific cell type. 
 SQZ APCs and Sub-Cell Types Activate CD8+ T Cells

We also measured the quantity of T cells by looking at the TILs when looking at a specific tumor. As shown below, this experiment, shows 21 times the number of CD8+ T cells infiltrate tumors when SQZ APCs are used compared to antigen alone. 
 SQZ APCs Drive High Number of CD8+ T Cells in Tumors 
 

Specificity 
 Specificity is key to ensuring responses are targeted, which could potentially result in better tolerability than treatments that broadly stimulate non-targeted T cell reactions. To evaluate specificity, in a preclinical study, we assessed SQZ APCs’ ability to induce specific immune responses without broadly stimulating the immune system by squeezing cells with an OVA. In a murine model, we tested the response of T cells specific to OVA, measured by the OT-I T cells shown in the graph below, and the response of T cells specific to a different model antigen, gp100, measured by the pmel T cells shown in the graph below. We observed that the cells squeezed with OVA caused activation and proliferation of OT-I T cells and not pmel T cells. We also squeezed cells with gp100 and found that nominal pmel T cells were activated and proliferated in vivo, as measured by the percent of cells that divided.

SQZ APCs Direct Specific Responses 
 

Quality 
 The true test of functionality of T cells is measured in their ability to impact disease; for example, how they infiltrate and kill tumors. By generating robust endogenous T cell responses, we believe the responses will be functional and of high quality, which is in contrast to ex vivo T cell expansion processes that cannot recreate the endogenous signaling environment necessary to generate a robust T cell response. The oncology preclinical studies described below verify the quality of the response as they demonstrate robust anti-tumor activity and formation of protective memory in vivo. 
 Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the SQZ-APC platform is capable of producing antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses that are directed against tumors in vivo.
SQZ APC Pipeline 
 We believe SQZ APC’s ability to induce CD8+ T cell responses and the importance of these responses have broad applicability in oncology and infectious diseases. With the ability to insert nearly any cargo, clinical data from one APC candidate can help inform implementation of other programs and streamline clinical development decisions on dosing and antigen/indication selection. Because we have seen comparable preclinical immune response data across the antigens we have squeezed into APCs, we believe SQZ APCs could translate to other therapeutic vaccines generated from the platform. Our pipeline of products currently in development with SQZ APCs is displayed below.

 SQZ APCs for Oncology 
 We are developing oncology product candidates derived from our SQZ APC platform in collaboration with Roche, designed to address multiple tumor types. Our lead SQZ APC product candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of HPV16+ solid tumors. We and Roche will alternate U.S. commercial rights for each SQZ APC oncology product developed, and we maintain full commercial rights for our SQZ APCs outside of oncology. It has not yet been determined whether we or Roche will have U.S. commercial rights for SQZ-PBMC-HPV. See “—Collaboration, Research and License Agreements—Roche Collaboration.”

The SQZ APC oncology platform is based on squeezing tumor-associated antigens directly into the cytosol, creating SQZ APCs that are designed to induce endogenous CD8+ T cells when administered to the patient. Once the antigens are delivered directly into the cytosol, the antigens are processed and presented on MHC Class I, where they activate the patient’s CD8+ T cells. The activated CD8+ T cells then proliferate and attack tumor cells that are associated with the antigen. In the context of our first product candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, the cell therapy is engineered by squeezing a patient’s own PBMCs with defined HPV16+ tumor antigens to create tumor-targeted APCs ex vivo before administering back to patient. This process is depicted below. 
 
Recent advancements in immuno-oncology have highlighted the importance of CD8+ T cells in attacking tumors. In addition, published clinical studies across tumor types have underscored both the prognostic value of CD8 tumor infiltration and the strong therapeutic correlation of CD8 infiltration to immunotherapy response. 
 The cancer immunity cycle depicted below describes the way a patient’s immune system interacts with a tumor to generate tumor-killing immune responses. The focus of our SQZ APC oncology product candidates is to engineer antigen presentation (steps 2 & 3), which are the seminal physiological events that lead to a productive CD8+ T cell response. The interaction of T cells with APCs at step 3 has significant downstream impact as it determines the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response (specificity) in addition to providing the stimulatory signals that determine ultimate proliferation (quantity) and phenotypic diversity (quality) of the resulting response.

We believe that our SQZ APC platform provides an advantage by driving the physiological interaction between antigen presenting cells and T cells that underpins the generation of a productive CD8+ T cell response, potentially providing a differentiated benefit for cancer patients. In preclinical studies with our SQZ APCs, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver antigen and create APCs (steps 2 and 3) that generate robust, specific CD8+ T cell responses capable of controlling and clearing tumors in mice. Beyond HPV related antigens, we have shown that SQZ APCs are able to elicit robust, specific CD8+ T cell responses to less immunogenic antigens such as KRAS protein with G12D and G12V mutations. 
 Lead SQZ APC Product Candidate: SQZ-PBMC-HPV 
 HPV+ Cancers Unmet Need and Market Opportunity 
 HPV infection causes some of the most common types of cancer, such as cervical and head-and-neck cancer, and there is significant need for new treatment options to address HPV+ tumors. HPV is one of the most common viruses worldwide. In 90% of individuals infected by HPV, the immune system successfully controls the virus and the HPV infection is resolved within two years without intervention. However, when certain strains of HPV persist for many years, the infection can lead to cancer. Despite recent efforts to prophylactically vaccinate for HPV, it is not expected that there will be significant decline in HPV+ cancers for many years due to the gap between vaccination age and average age of HPV+ cancer onset. 
 According to the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, in the United States as of September 2020, HPV+ tumors represent 3% of all cancers in women and 2% of all cancers in men, resulting in over 39,000 new cases of HPV+ tumors every year. The burden of HPV infection is even larger outside of the United States, with HPV+ tumors representing 4.5% of all cancers worldwide, according to the International Journal of Cancer, resulting in 570,000 new cases for women and 60,000 new cases for men every year. According to the CDC, HPV infection plays a significant role in the formation of more than 90% of anal and cervical cancers, and most cases of vaginal (75%), oropharyngeal (70%), vulval (70%) and penile (60%) cancers. In addition, an increasing percentage of head-and-neck cancer is being attributed to HPV infection, particularly those arising from the oropharynx. 
 The current standard of care for HPV+ cancers differs by tumor type but typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. These treatments are associated with acute and long-term effects including mucositis, swallowing dysfunction, dry mouth and dental problems. When patients progress, few options are available to them. In some of these tumor types, checkpoint inhibitors are being utilized, however only a portion of patients respond, and significant unmet need remains. 
 We see the treatment of patients with HPV+ tumors not only as an opportunity to serve a population in significant need of new treatment options, but also as a key to unlocking additional tumor types we could potentially treat. HPV+ cancers are a well-studied cancer type. In particular, HPV+ tumors in patients that are HLA-A*02+ have been extensively researched, with many known biomarkers that can aid in assessing therapeutic activity and monitoring patients’ immune systems and tumors. HLA-A*02+ patients comprise approximately 30% to 50% of the Caucasian population in the United States. We are enrolling patients with various HPV+ tumors who are HLA-A*02+ in our Phase 1 clinical trial of SQZ-PBMC-HPV to allow us to draw on this knowledge in evaluating the activity of SQZ-PBMC-HPV. 
 Our SQZ APCs are not inherently HLA-restricted and our eAPCs, which are based on an mRNA cargo, are designed to be agnostic to patient HLA type. 
 We selected our first target antigen, HPV16 E6/E7, to develop SQZ-PBMC-HPV to treat HPV16+ cancers. E6 and E7 are oncoproteins found in HPV16+ tumors. E6 and E7 are highly expressed in tumor cells, absent in normal cells, and are thought to be the cancer drivers in HPV16+ tumors, which we believe make them ideal antigens for use as targets of tumor-directed active immunization. By administering SQZ-PBMC-HPV to activate CD8+ T cells that target HPV E6/E7, we believe we will be able to specifically treat HPV+ tumors. 
 SQZ-PBMC-HPV: Clinical Development 
 SQZ-PBMC-HPV is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of HPV16+ advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In this trial, SQZ-PBMC-HPV is being studied as a monotherapy and in combination with other immune-oncology agents, including cohorts in combination with atezolizumab, as well as ipilimumab and nivolumab. The Phase 1 trial has a flexible design to allow for additional potential combinations. We believe that positive data from this trial could support our development of a new differentiated treatment for patients with HPV16+ tumors, as well as provide support for our SQZ APC platform. 
 The primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate safety and tolerability, to determine the maximum tolerated dose, if any, or maximum administered dose and to define a dose for the expansion cohort and future studies. Unlike certain other oncology cell therapies, patients in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial receive no pre-conditioning and we plan for the treatment to be administered without post-treatment hospitalization. As part of the trial protocol, 24 hours of hospitalization is required for observation purposes only for the first two patients in a newly started cohort. SQZ-PBMC-HPV is administered intravenously via a simple syringe push. The secondary objectives of the trial are to assess antitumor activity in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and to assess dose manufacturing feasibility. Biomarkers are being measured through both blood and tumor biopsy. These biomarkers include the following: 
 Peripheral Blood-based Biomarkers 
  
∎ | HPV-specific T cells and their cytokine secretion
--+--------------------------------------------------


∎ | Blood cytokine levels
--+----------------------

 15

 Tumor Tissue-based Biomarkers 
  
∎ | CD8 T cell infiltration
--+------------------------


∎ | Tumor microenvironment
--+-----------------------


∎ | Potential mechanisms of resistance
--+-----------------------------------

 Among other markers of immune responses, we believe CD8 TILs are a potentially relevant pharmacodynamic biomarker. While we cannot predict whether increases in CD8 TILs correlate with clinical benefit in our initial clinical study population, there is evidence supporting this correlation in the scientific literature. Multiple published studies, across tumor types, have demonstrated the strong correlation of increases in CD8 TILs to clinical responses when patients are treated with immunotherapies. Scientific literature also indicates that CD8 TILs are a powerful prognostic indicator for multiple tumor types. With strong support of the scientific literature and industry observations, we believe that demonstrating an increase in CD8 TIL responses in tumor biopsies from patients who are on study, relative to baseline, would be a meaningful indicator of therapeutic activity for SQZ-PBMC-HPV, especially in light of these patients’ immune status and advanced disease, with many patients on trial having progressed on multiple previous therapies, oftentimes including immune checkpoint inhibitors. An additional biomarker that we are measuring is granzyme B, or GZMB, positivity of cells. GZMB is expressed in T cells that have been activated or stimulated to become cytotoxic and can be an indicator of killing activity. 
 The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to test multiple monotherapy doses and regimens. The first cohorts include: 
  
∎ | Cohort 1: Low-dose - 0.5 million live cells per kilogram dosed once every three weeks
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Cohort 2: High-dose - 2.5 million live cells per kilogram dosed once every three weeks
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Cohort 3: High-dose Double Prime - 2.5 million live cells per kilogram dosed on Day 0 and Day 1 followed by one dose every three weeks thereafter
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of December 31, 2020, 12 patients with advanced metastatic disease have been dosed across these monotherapy cohorts; three in Cohort 1, five in Cohort 2, and four in Cohort 3. There have been no DLTs observed. One patient in Cohort 1 experienced grade 2 cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, which was self-limiting and a grade 2 infusion reaction, both of which were deemed treatment-related. The grade 2 CRS was classified as a serious adverse event due to the investigator admitting the patient to the hospital to observe the CRS. We have not seen any grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events. We believe that these safety data could enable transitioning to earlier lines of therapy. All doses in the trial have been manufactured in under 24 hours and each patient had successful manufacturing of their SQZ APCs. 
 We are encouraged by the safety data and manufacturing we have seen so far in the trial, as well as the initial biomarker data from the low-dose cohort, which showed some early signs of intratumoral immune activity in certain patients. All three patients had progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The initial biomarker data from the three patients in the low-dose cohort, based on paired tumor biopsies at baseline and four weeks on treatment, is shown below: 
 
 
∎ | Patient 1 demonstrated a net decrease of 80 CD8 T cells per mm2 and net decrease of 9 granzymeB+ CD8 T cells per mm2.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Patient 2 demonstrated a net increase of 990 CD8 T cells per mm2 and net increase of 32 granzymeB+ CD8 T cells per mm2. This patient had been on study for ten months as of December 31, 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Patient 3 demonstrated a net increase of 30 CD8 T cells per mm2 and net increase of 47 granzymeB+ CD8 T cells per mm2.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For the three patients evaluable for CD8 TIL analysis in Cohort 2, the biomarker data were consistent with that seen in Cohort 1. We expect to present comprehensive biomarker data from patients across the monotherapy cohorts at a scientific conference in mid-2021. 
 The total number of patients we will enroll in the trial will depend on safety and observed immunogenic effects. We may enroll up to a total of 200 patients and we have the ability to open expansion cohorts to further assess the antitumor activity of SQZ-PBMC-HPV as monotherapy as well as add multiple combination cohorts. 
 SQZ-PBMC-HPV: Preclinical Studies 
 We have conducted preclinical studies that support our Phase 1 clinical trial. Our lead product candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, relies on the body’s immune system for its biological activity, specifically to interact with a patient’s CD8+ T cells. For preclinical mouse studies, human cells cannot be used as they would be rejected by the mouse’s immune system. We created a mouse SQZ-APC analogue that is comparable to our human SQZ-APC product candidate. This same analogue is used in all of our preclinical mouse studies. Also, in these studies we often 
 16

compare SQZ to cross-presentation. In order to achieve cross presentation in our preclinical studies, the cells are incubated with antigen which results in endocytosis. The engulfed material is presented on MHC-II and cross-presentation results in a small amount of antigen to be presented on MHC-I. 
 In a preclinical study, we inoculated 35 mice with HPV+ tumors. After 10 days of tumor growth, we dosed 20 mice with inactive control and 15 mice with SQZ-PBMC-HPV. We observed that at Day 32 the mice dosed with the SQZ-PBMC-HPV had low tumor volume or had their tumors cleared with an average tumor volume of less than 80 mm3, while mice treated with inactive control had an average tumor volume over 1,300 mm3. This data is depicted in the graph below. 
 Effect of Therapeutic Treatment with SQZ-PBMC-HPV on Tumor Regression in Mice 
 

In a separate preclinical study, we inoculated 28 mice with HPV+ tumors. After 18 days of tumor growth, we administered SQZ-PBMC-HPV to 14 mice and inactive control to 14 mice. At Day 28, the tumors in the SQZ-PBMC-HPV treated mice began to regress, at which point we assessed the T cell activity inside the tumors. For 7 mice in each group, we measured the TILs in these tumors by measuring the percentage of live cells that were immune cells, which we identified by the immune-cell marker CD45. As shown in the graph below, we observed an average of 29% of the live cells were TILs for the mice dosed with SQZ-PBMC-HPV, as compared to approximately 6% of the live cells in the control group. Of these TILs, as shown in the graph below, we assessed that an average of about 25% of the TILs for the treated mice were CD8+ T cells, as compared to an average of about 5% in the control group. In addition, as shown in the graph below, of the CD8+ T cells that gathered in the tumor, we assessed that over 80% of those cells were specific to HPV antigens in the mice treated with SQZ-PBMC-HPV, as compared to less than 9% in the control group. We believe these data show that SQZ-PBMC-HPV induces antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that home to the tumor effectively and exhibit anti-tumor activity.

In an additional tumor study of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in mice shown below, we measured the increase of CD8+ T cells and E7-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor. We observed that mice treated with SQZ-PBMC-HPV had 21 times the number of CD8+ T-cells in the tumor when compared to mice receiving inactive control. In addition, mice treated with SQZ-PBMC-HPV had 524 times the number of E7 specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor when compared to mice receiving inactive control. 
 CD8+ T Cells and HPV-Specific CD8+ T Cells Increase after SQZ-PBMC-HPV Treatment in Mice Tumors 
 


 
TILS: CD8+ T Cells per mg of Tumor | TILS: E7 Specific CD8+ T Cells per mg of Tumor

 
A commonly observed side effect with current T cell therapies is severe cytokine release syndrome. In our preclinical studies in mice, we measured the cytokines, MCP-1, IFNγ, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-6 and TNFα. Mice dosed with our SQZ APCs had serum cytokine profiles 
 18

similar to untreated mice. We believe these data further demonstrate that SQZ APCs do not induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile and thus support our expectation that they should be well tolerated in the clinic. 
 We also conducted a preclinical study to assess the capabilities of the SQZ-PBMC-HPV to prophylactically prevent tumor growth. We administered SQZ-PBMC-HPV at Day -14 and Day -7 to 15 mice and inactive control to 15 mice prior to inoculating them with HPV+ tumor cells on Day 0. As shown in the graph below, we observed that the 15 mice prophylactically dosed with SQZ-PBMC-HPV cleared the tumor cells and did not show any tumor growth. In contrast, the 15 mice that received inactive control showed tumor growth that averaged nearly 1500 mm3 in volume by Day 30. 
 Effect of Prophylactic Vaccination with SQZ-PBMC-HPV on Tumor Growth in Mice 
 

We tested for evidence of immunological memory in the prophylactically treated mice by re-injecting these mice with additional tumor cells. As shown in the graph below, 60 days following initial treatment with SQZ-PBMC-HPV, none of the prophylactically treated mice showed evidence of new tumor growth when re-challenged, suggesting that SQZ-PBMC-HPV triggered the development of memory T cells against HPV+ tumors and suppressed recurrence of these tumors.

Re-Challenge Experiment: Effect on New Tumor Growth in Prophylactically Vaccinated SQZ-PBMC-HPV 
 Mice 60 Days after Treatment 
 

We have evaluated in preclinical studies how SQZ APCs perform therapeutically in comparison to a peptide-based vaccine, benchmarking their capabilities against a well-established cancer vaccine strategy used in multiple clinical trials. In this preclinical study, we dosed 15 mice with SQZ APCs, 15 with peptide vaccine and 30 with inactive control at Day 16 following injection with tumor cells. At Day 28, the tumors in the SQZ APC-treated mice began to regress, while the inactive control and the peptide vaccine group continued to grow. At this time point we assessed the activity within the tumors, taking TIL measurements. We observed that the tumors of SQZ APC-treated mice were made up of an average of 47% immune cells, as compared to only 20% in the peptide vaccine treated mice, and 9% in the inactive control, as measured by CD45+ cells. Of those immune cells, for the SQZ APC-treated mice, an average of 33% of the immune cells were CD8+ T cells, as compared to only 14% in the peptide vaccine-treated mice, and 4% in the inactive control mice. Of those CD8+ T cells, an average of 87% of them were HPV specific for the SQZ-treated mice, compared to only 33% in the peptide vaccine-treated mice and only 2% for the inactive control. In these experiments, the peptide vaccine contained ~15,000 times more antigen than the SQZ APCs, which we believe further highlights the potential potency of the SQZ APC platform relative to alternative vaccine modalities. 
 20

Anti-Tumor and Infiltration Activity of SQZ-PBMC-HPV and Traditional Vaccine Approaches 
 

We conducted additional preclinical studies in mice to assess the dose-level and boosting effect on anti-tumor activity. We observed both a dose effect shown by the magnitude of the E7 specific CD8+ T cell response being developed in the live cell dose, and a boosting effect shown by additional immunizations increasing the magnitude of E7 specific CD8+ T cell responses. 
 We have conducted studies of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in combination with other immune-oncology agents in mice. A portion of these studies evaluated the combinations of SQZ-PBMC-HPV with a novel PD1-IL2v bi-specific antibody, under development by our partner Roche, that is designed to bind to PD-1+ T cells and stimulate them with IL2. Data from these studies were presented at SITC in November 2020. This compound aims to enhance endogenous expansion and activity of T cells that express PD-1. We believe this compound could enhance the specific T cells SQZ-PBMC-HPV is able to elicit. 
 In a study in the TC-1 tumor model we allowed the tumors to progress for 14 days before treatment to model a challenging later-stage tumor. Twenty-four mice remained untreated. On day 14, 24 mice were treated with SQZ-PBMC-HPV. On day 21, half of the mice that were treated with SQZ-PBMC-HPV and 12 of the untreated mice began a weekly regimen of PD1-IL2v. Two other groups in the study assessed a different novel compound and are not included in the data below, accounting for 24 mice. The data below show the tumor growth in untreated mice, PD1-IL2v alone treated mice, SQZ-PBMC-HPV alone treated mice, and PD1-IL2v SQZ-PBMC-HPV combination treated mice. The surviving mice were followed to day 84. All of the mice in the untreated group and the PD1-IL2v group alone had grown tumors and had died by 40 days earlier in the study. In the SQZ-PBMC-HPV alone group 17% of mice remained tumor free and 100% of the mice that received the combination of SQZ-PBMC-HPV and PD1-IL2v were tumor free. 
 21

Anti-tumor Activity of SQZ-PBMC-HPV and PD1-IL2v as Monotherapies and in Combination 
 

In an additional study of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in combination with PD1-IL2v in the TC-1 tumor model, 20 mice were implanted with tumors. On day 14,10 mice were immunized with SQZ-PBMC-HPV. On day 21, 5 mice that had received SQZ-PBMC-HPV and 5 mice who had not were given PD1-IL2v. On day 24 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated from the tumors and an analysis of the CD8 T cells in the tumors was conducted. The average number of antigen-specific CD8 T cells per mg of tumor in the untreated mice was 34, in PD1-IL2v alone treated mice the average was 42, in SQZ-PBMC-HPV alone treated mice the average was 16,488, and, in the mice that received the combination of the two the average was 60,571. The combination cohort show an over 1,400 times increase in HPV-specific CD8 TILs from PD1-IL2v alone, over 1,700 from untreated mice, and over three times the increase of SQZ-PBMC-HPV alone.

We have also conducted in vitro preclinical studies to evaluate the activity of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in human cells. We cultured SQZ-PBMC-HPV cells with E7-specific responder cells and measured IFNγ as a surrogate for activity. As shown in the graphs below, we observed an average of more than seven times the amount of IFNγ secretion from the cell lines containing SQZ-PBMC-HPV compared to unprocessed PBMCs. We also evaluated activity in all of the constituent cell types of SQZ-PBMC-HPV. As shown in the graph below, we observed that every cell type showed a functional response as APCs and lead to T cell activation as measured by IFNγ secretion.

Additional Oncology Indications: Targeted Oncology Opportunities Beyond HPV+ Tumors 
 We believe our SQZ APCs have the potential to be broadly applicable across cancer types in a “plug-and-play” manner by allowing us to swap antigens based on the desired indication. We intend to apply the insights gained from the development of our first product candidate to expand the application of our SQZ APCs to a broad range of cancers, using both defined-antigen and personalized-antigen approaches. 
 We consider antigen categories based on their immunogenicity, which determines how difficult it will be to create an immune response, with the most immunogenic antigens being the easiest and the least immunogenic being the most difficult (as shown below). 

23




HPV is a well-studied antigen with well-defined biomarkers. Point mutations, like KRAS mutants, are considered to be more difficult to target with a specific immune response. We have shown in preclinical human in vitro systems the ability of SQZ APCs to elicit immune responses for both highly immunogenic (HPV) and less immunogenic (mutant KRAS) antigens, as shown in the graphs below. 
 SQZ Showed Immune Responses Across Antigen Types Including HPV and KRAS 
 

Targeting of KRAS protein by small molecule inhibitors in a mutant-specific manner has been historically challenging. Recently, selective inhibitors of certain KRAS mutations, namely G12C, have demonstrated encouraging preliminary anti-tumor effects, providing clinical validation for targeting mutant KRAS in cancer. However, the majority of KRAS mutations remain out of reach for small molecule inhibitors. In preclinical studies, we have been able to elicit responses to KRAS G12D and G12V mutations, which represent over 50% of KRAS mutations, four times that of G12C. There are approximately 100,000 patients per year in the United States with KRAS G12D and G12V mutations across multiple tumor types, including pancreatic, colorectal and some lung cancers. 
 
24

In preclinical experiments, we squeezed KRAS G12D and KRAS G12V antigens into two sets of human donor cells and measured the responses by culturing with antigen-specific responder CD8+ T cells and measuring IFNγ as a surrogate for activity. In both studies, we observed antigen-specific activation of CD8+ T cells in quantities more robust than control. The data below show that when cells squeezed with KRAS G12D antigen are compared to those squeezed with HPV or wildtype KRAS, the KRAS G12D SQZ cells activated KRAS G12D specific CD8+ T cells ten times more effectively than the SQZ HPV cells, which served as an active control. In the G12V study, they were over 22 times more effective. 
 SQZ APCs Squeezed with KRas G12D or G12V Elicit Functional CD8 T Cell Responses 
 

Based on these results, we believe SQZ APCs have significant potential in HPV+, KRAS mutant cancers, and other patient populations in a targeted manner. 
 Next Generation SQZ APCs: eAPCs and HLA Agnostic Cargo 
 We are encouraged by initial observations and progress in the ongoing Phase 1 trial of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in HPV+ tumors. Our eAPC program is designed to build on this progress by leveraging the cargo flexibility of the Cell Squeeze technology to create next generation products. There are multiple signals that contribute to effective CD8+ T cell activation. Signal 1 is the presentation of antigen sequences on MHC-I on the APC to the TCR of the CD8+ T cell. Signal 2 is costimulatory surface receptors on the APC that interact with counterparts on the T cell surface. Signal 3 is secreted cytokines that can modulate T cell activation states. We are designing our eAPCs to potentially drive more powerful immune stimulation by incorporating additional signal 2 and signal 3 elements by delivering additional mRNA cargos. This includes potential combinations of signals such as CD70, CD86, IL-2, IL-12, IFNγ, among others. In addition, eAPCs use the full E6 and E7 proteins as the antigen source by delivering mRNA sequences that code for the desired antigens instead of synthetic long peptides. This may ultimately eliminate existing HLA restrictions, enhance presentation of multiple CD8 and CD4 epitopes, and broaden the addressable population by 2-3 times the number of patients. 
 By directly encoding costimulatory signals and cytokines into the APC, this approach potentially enables us to incorporate critical functionality of desirable combination drugs, such as next generation IL2 drugs, directly into the APC. Moreover, by restricting the availability of the cytokine or costimulatory molecule to the APC itself we believe we can potentially reduce toxicity associated with systemic exposure to potent molecules such as IL2 and IL12 while otherwise retaining the ability of antigen-specific T cells to benefit from their stimulation. 
 
25

The eAPC platform advancements would be potentially applicable across future oncology and infectious disease products. We plan to present preclinical data from our next-generation SQZ APCs at a scientific meeting in the first half of 2021 and plan to submit an IND for this program to the FDA by the end of 2021. 
 
We have conducted preclinical experiments evaluating SQZ eAPCs with different cargos and their ability to drive functional enhancements. In one study, we squeezed human-donor PBMCs simultaneously with 4 cargos: an antigen encoding mRNA, CD86 mRNA, membrane bound IL-2 mRNA (mbIL-2), and membrane bound IL-12 mRNA (mbIL-12). One day later the cells were stained with markers for each intracellular cytokine. Less than 2% of control cells express any of the cytokines. An average of over 88% of eAPCs cells were positive for CD86 markers, over 74% for IL-2 markers, and over 75% for IL-12 markers.

SQZ APCs for Infectious Diseases 
 As with SQZ APCs for oncology, our platform in infectious diseases has the potential to create rapid and powerful therapeutic vaccines that induce specific endogenous CD8+ T cells to drive a targeted immune response against chronic and acute infectious diseases in both prophylactic and therapeutic patient settings. 


Increased pathogen-specific CD8+ T cell activity can be associated with improved patient outcomes for some infectious diseases. For example, the ability to clear HBV infection has been associated with the presence of a strong virus-specific T cell response. Robust CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses are present in patients with resolved HBV infections, while in patients with chronic HBV infection, the HBV-specific T cell response is weak. Increased levels of HBcAg-specific CD8+ T cells is correlated with lower detectable levels of the HBV viral genome. Additionally, HIV patients that have active CD8+ T cells may be able to control their disease to the point where they are non-symptomatic and cannot transmit. These patients are often referred to as elite controllers. Elite controllers of HIV without disease progression have elevated HIV-specific CD8+ T cell titers. 
 Although HIV treatments have been in development for decades and anti-retroviral drugs have made strides for HIV, HIV/AIDS is still a leading cause of death in low-income countries. Current therapies have been hampered by drug toxicities and immune-deficiency complications which have limited their ability to control the disease in the long term. Other chronic infections also face therapeutic shortcomings. For example, HBV can lead to chronic infection, severe liver damage, and even cancer. Antivirals and interferon injections are current standard of care and used over a patient’s lifetime, but many patients advance to needing liver transplants. In addition to these known diseases in need of targeted solutions, pandemics like Ebola, Swine Flu, SARS and COVID-19 have highlighted the need for a vaccine system that can rapidly respond to new pathogens. Even prior to the recent COVID-19 impact, the CDC estimated that as many as 56,000 people die from the flu or flu-like illness in the United States each year. 
 Infectious diseases represent large patient populations with significant unmet medical need. Our first indication in infectious disease, chronic HBV, has the potential to impact the more than 240 million people chronically infected worldwide. Two billion people have been infected with HBV and over 880,000 people die each year due to HBV-associated liver conditions, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic hepatitis B infection causes almost 40% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Although current therapies improve patient outcomes, risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma remains elevated. According to the CDC, as of 2016, 862,000 patients in the United States were reported to be HBV positive, with over 3,000 new cases every year. Other chronic infections also face shortcomings in treatment. Significant advances have been made in the development of effective HIV treatments that allow people living with HIV to suppress their virus to undetectable levels. However, HIV antiviral therapies are life-long therapeutics and could cause a significant emotional and physical damage to people living with HIV. To address the burdens of life-long treatment, a finite treatment may be essential towards improving patient’s quality of life. Over 1 million people in the US are living with HIV as of 2016 with over 35,000 new diagnoses each year. 
 In the case of certain high-risk patients and emerging pandemics, the capabilities of SQZ APCs as both a prophylactic and a therapeutic may provide a unique opportunity due to their potential production speed and ability to generate antigen specific CD8+ T cell responses. 
 We have been assessing our ability to elicit immune response with specific infectious disease model antigens and have observed SQZ APCs’ ability to generate anti-viral responses against multiple antigens, including HBV, HPV, CMV, and SIV, the non-human primate form of HIV. We are currently conducting additional indication-specific studies to support our first IND submission in chronic HBV. We plan to submit an IND for this program to the FDA for the treatment of HBV in 2022. 
 In a study to assess SQZ APCs ability to induce HBV-specific CD8 T cells responses, we generated SQZ APCs by delivering HbsAg mRNA. As a control, human PBMCs were squeezed with no cargo, an “empty squeeze”. The APCs and control cells were co-cultured with HBsAg responder cells and HBV-specific CD8 T cell activation was measured with IFNγ ELISpot. The SQZ APCs generated with HBsAg mRNA were observed to be approximately 6 times as potent in activating T cells than the empty squeeze APCs. These data demonstrated the ability of SQZ APC to elicit specific CD8 T cell responses against HBV.

PBMCs Squeezed with HBV mRNA (HBsAg) Elicited Specific CD8 T Cell Responses 
 

To illustrate our potential across disease antigens and patient HLA types, in an experiment with CMV antigen, we squeezed human HLA-A2+HLA-B35+ cells with two synthetic long peptides, or SLPs, containing sequences derived from CMV pp65. One SLP (pp65116-140) contained the HLA-B35 restricted epitope, and the other contained the HLA-A2 restricted epitope. Cells were squeezed with either the A2 SLP alone, B35 SLP alone or both. Following squeezing, the cells were incubated with HLA-B35 reactive CD8+ T cells or HLA-A2, reactive CD8+ T cells. After ~16-18 hours, IFNγ was measured to assess the activation of the CD8+ T cells. The SQZ groups in these studies elicited responses from 4-8 times higher than cross-presented cells. These data also show the ability of SQZ to insert multiple antigens and elicit robust, specific responses to both. 

28


Cells Squeezed with CMV Antigens Elicited Specific CD8+ T Cell Responses 
 

We also conducted an experiment with SIV antigen in which CD8+ T cells were isolated via negative selection from the PBMCs of SIV-infected CM9-reactive rhesus macaques and frozen. Freshly isolated rhesus macaque PBMCs were squeezed with SIV CM9 SLP. The squeezed group elicited an IFNγ response that was ~10-fold above background. 
 SQZ APCs Engineered with SIV Antigen Elicited Immune Response 
 

To test for the flu virus and demonstrate flexibility across peptide or mRNA-based cargo, we conducted a study using M1 mRNA as the influenza cargo. Human PBMCs from an HLA-A2+ donor were squeezed with mRNA encoding full-length M1 protein derived from Influenza A virus (IAV). PBMCs were then co-cultured with HLA-A2, M1-reactive CD8+ T cells. After 16 to 20 hours, IFNγ was measured to assess the activation of the CD8+ T cells. The SQZ group elicited an IFNγ response that was ~10-fold above background. 
 
29

PBMCs Squeezed with Flu-Associated mRNA Elicited Specific CD8 T Cell Responses 
 

We believe the SQZ APC approach to infectious diseases could offer a more lasting solution as both a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Additionally, through the use of conserved viral components as cargo, SQZ APCs could potentially protect against and treat virus with high mutation rates. 
 Our effort to rapidly develop a new vaccine would be further supported by our ongoing development of a point-of-care solution to manufacture the SQZ PBMC product using a fully closed, automated system suitable for on-site cell therapy production. This decentralized manufacturing approach could enable rapid access to a cell therapy intervention. For therapeutic intervention, the point-of-care implementation could reduce treatment complexity and cost, thereby enhancing accessibility. For rapid response, point of care systems could provide a fast means of reacting to a pandemic. Point of care implementation eliminates the need for a complex shipping/tracking infrastructure and may also save time and cost by simplifying the burdensome release testing typical of centralized manufacturing. 
 SQZ Antigen Carriers: Engineering RBCs to Direct Immune Responses 
 In our SQZ AAC and SQZ TAC platforms, we utilize the Cell Squeeze technology to squeeze RBCs to create SQZ Antigen Carriers, that contain antigen and aim to guide a specific immune response. Our process causes the Antigen Carriers to resemble aged RBCs. Once injected into the patient, these engineered Antigen Carriers are cleared by the same process as aged RBCs, acting as “Trojan horses” to deliver high quantities of antigen to endogenous professional antigen presenting cells. 
 

In general, the cargo loaded into the SQZ Antigen Carriers dictates the type of subsequent immune response. SQZ Activating Antigen Carriers (SQZ AACs) loaded with antigen cargo and adjuvant aim to activate an immune response against the antigen. On the other hand, SQZ Tolerizing Antigen Carriers (SQZ TACs) loaded with antigen cargo (no adjuvant) aim to tolerize the immune response to that antigen. 

30




SQZ Activating Antigen Carriers (AAC) Platform 
 Our SQZ AAC platform is designed to induce robust antigen presentation in vivo, following a similar logic of targeting antigen presentation as our SQZ APC platform, which is designed to create APCs ex vivo. To create SQZ AACs, we squeeze RBCs with an antigen and activating adjuvant. The process is tuned to make the engineered SQZ AACs appear aged. These SQZ AACs are designed to be rapidly taken up by professional antigen presenting cells once administered to patients in a natural process similar to destroying aged RBCs in the body known as eryptosis. Through this process we use SQZ AACs as a “Trojan horse” to deliver the antigen and activation factors to the professional, endogenous antigen presenting cells. Professional antigen presenting cells are specialized for MHC Class I and MHC Class II presentation of antigens to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. These professional antigen presenting cells engulf the SQZ AACs and, through cross-presentation, present the antigen on MHC Class I, priming a potent anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response. We believe we will be able to elicit greater CD8+ T cell activation than current cell therapies or vaccines, which also use cross presentation, because we are able to load our SQZ AACs with more antigen and, through eryptosis, have them specifically targeted to and engulfed by the more powerful professional antigen presenting cells. 
 

Our current pipeline of products being developed using the AAC platform is depicted below. 
 

SQZ AACs for Oncology 
 Our first SQZ AAC IND in oncology for HPV+ tumors was cleared by the FDA in January 2021. We are also developing additional product candidates for the treatment of other solid tumors. For our initial AACs, including SQZ-AAC-HPV, we are using the patient’s RBCs as the originating cells. We plan to follow HPV with additional indications, including SQZ AACs for KRAS mutant tumors, for which we plan to file an IND with the FDA in 2022. In the future, we intend to explore the development of allogeneic AACs using healthy donor RBCs. 
 SQZ-AAC-HPV relies on the body’s immune system for its biological activity. For our preclinical mouse studies, human cells cannot be used as they would be rejected by the mouse’s immune system. We have created a mouse-cell analogue that is comparable to our human product candidate. We have used this analogue in all of our preclinical studies involving mice that are discussed. 
 31

Key to our process is the rapid uptake of AACs and their engulfment by endogenous antigen presenting cells. In a preclinical study, PKH26, a lipophilic, fluorescent membrane dye, was used to label mouse RBCs, before they were squeezed with E7 SLP and an adjuvant to generate PKH26-labeled SQZ-AAC-HPV. Following administration of these fluorescently labeled cells to 3 mice with unprocessed cells and 3 mice with SQZ-AAC-HPV, the presence of unprocessed RBCs and AACs in the blood was measured at various intervals (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, and 24 hours) using flow cytometry. We observed that all AACs were cleared from the blood within one hour, as shown in the graph below, suggesting rapid uptake. 
 Clearance of SQZ AACs from Circulation in Mice 
 

In another preclinical study, we sought to demonstrate that SQZ AACs are responsible for the activation, rather than the adjuvant alone or peptide alone that we squeezed into the cells. In this study, we squeezed RBCs with E7 peptide as the antigen with an activating adjuvant to generate AACs. We also created cells squeezed only with E7 peptide, and cells squeezed only with the adjuvant. We also had an inactive control group. Five mice in each group were dosed and monitored for their endogenous responses by measuring the secretion of IFNγ, as displayed by percentage of IFNγ positive CD44hi marked T cells. The below data are seven days after treatment. We believe these data showed that SQZ AACs require both an antigen and adjuvant to elicit a T cell response. 

32


Adjuvant and Peptide Squeezed Together Elicited Immune Response 
 

In addition, we have also conducted preclinical studies in mice immunized with our SQZ AACs in which we observed robust proliferation of both CD8+ and CD4 T cells. 
 Lead SQZ AAC Product Candidate: SQZ-AAC-HPV 
 We believe the large patient population, significant unmet need, and the validated nature of HPV make HPV+ cancers an attractive target for our lead SQZ AAC product candidate. Our first product candidate using our SQZ AAC platform, SQZ-AAC-HPV, is derived from squeezing defined HPV+ tumor antigens and an adjuvant into a patient’s own RBCs. SQZ-AAC-HPV is designed to be engulfed by the patient’s endogenous, professional antigen presenting cells, causing activation of HPV+-tumor-targeted CD8+ T cells. The FDA cleared our IND for this program in January 2021. 
 SQZ-AAC-HPV: Clinical Development 
 We plan to evaluate SQZ-AAC-HPV in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of HPV16+ advanced or metastatic solid tumors in monotherapy and in combinations with other immune-oncology agents. Like our SQZ-PBMC-HPV trial, this study has a flexible design to allow for expansion of cohorts where there is potential for beneficial impact for patients, addition of multiple potential dosing cohorts and combination cohorts. 
 The primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate safety and tolerability and to determine a dose for the expansion cohort and future studies. Patients in the trial will not require pre-conditioning and we plan for SQZ-AAC-HPV to be administered without post-treatment hospitalization. As part of the trial protocol, 24 hours of hospitalization will be required for observation purposes only for the first two patients in a newly started cohort. The secondary objective of the trial is to assess antitumor activity in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors through biomarkers from both blood and tumor as well as imaging. We expect data from this trial will inform our translation activities for SQZ-AAC-KRAS given the similarities in manufacturing and immunological mechanism. 
 SQZ-AAC-HPV: Preclinical Studies 
 Similar to our SQZ-APC platform, our preclinical work has demonstrated robust immune responses with SQZ AACs across the aforementioned quantity, quality, and specificity metrics. The data detailed below illustrate the potent anti-tumor activity of SQZ AACs in murine HPV tumor models. 
 In a preclinical study, we prophylactically dosed 10 mice with SQZ-AAC-HPV and 10 mice with inactive control. We then injected the mice with tumor cells. As shown in the graph below, on Day 28, we observed that all 10 mice dosed with SQZ-AAC-HPV cleared the tumor cells and showed no signs of tumor growth, as compared to the mice that received inactive control, which showed an average tumor volume of 900 mm3. In an additional prophylactic study where mice were given SQZ-AAC-HPV on Day -9 and Day -7 before tumor injection, we re-challenged the mice in which we observed no tumor growth on Day 62 with additional tumor cells and observed slowed tumor growth, suggesting generation of a memory response in the SQZ-AAC-HPV treated mice. 
 33

Effect on Tumor Growth in Prophylactically Treated SQZ-AAC-HPV Mice 
 

In another preclinical study, we injected mice with tumor cells to simulate the therapeutic setting. Ten days after injection, we dosed 10 mice with SQZ-AAC-HPV and 10 mice with inactive control. Two days later, we dosed the mice that received SQZ-AAC-HPV with a second dose. Each dose was 250 million cells. As shown in the graph below, we observed that mice dosed with SQZ-AAC-HPV showed reduced tumor growth at Day 28 with average tumor volumes below 60 mm3, as compared to an average tumor volume over 1000 mm3 for untreated mice. 
 Effect of Therapeutic Treatment with SQZ-AAC-HPV on Tumor Growth in Mice 
 

In a separate preclinical study, we evaluated the activity of the SQZ-AAC-HPV in mouse tumors. We dosed 10 mice with SQZ-AAC-HPV and 5 mice with inactive control. At seven days after treatment with SQZ AACs, we measured the TILs in 5 of the SQZ-AAC-HPV mice. At this timepoint, we observed 15 times the number of CD8+ T cells in the tumor compared to control in these 5 mice. On average, 80% of the CD8+ TILs in the treated mice were specific to E7, the HPV-associated antigen; therefore, the SQZ-AAC-HPV treated tumors contained over 900 times more HPV specific CD8+ T cells compared to control when evaluated at Day 7. 
 
34

CD8+ T Cell and HPV-Specific CD8+ T Cell Increased after SQZ-AAC-HPV Treatment in Mice Tumors 
 

 Future Development 
 We believe our SQZ AACs have the potential to be broadly applicable across cancer types and we are currently conducting preclinical studies to evaluate mutant KRAS, an established oncogene that includes some pancreatic, colorectal, lung and many other tumor types for our second SQZ AAC clinical program. KRAS-associated cancers represent ~30% of all cancers, and over 90% of all pancreatic cancers. We plan to target mutant KRAS G12D and G12V as the first targets in KRAS. 
 We also intend to explore the development of allogeneic SQZ AACs using healthy donor RBCs. With the abilities of the platform to elicit powerful T cell responses, we believe SQZ AACs may also be synergistic with immune therapies as combinations. Additionally, we believe this platform could also have applicability in infectious diseases as with our APC platform. 
 
SQZ Tolerizing Antigen Carrier (TAC) Platform 
 Our SQZ TAC platform uses RBCs as a “Trojan horse” to deliver the antigen to endogenous, professional antigen presenting cells. To create our SQZ TACs, we squeeze RBCs with antigen and engineer the SQZ TACs so that they appear aged. The TACs are then administered to patients and are rapidly taken up by professional antigen presenting cells in the natural process similar to destroying aged RBCs. Our SQZ TAC platform omits adjuvant in order to leverage the default tolerogenic nature of this process. 
 

35

Our pipeline of product candidates based on our SQZ TAC platform is shown below. 

 **The JDRF T1D Fund has provided equity investments to help progress the T1D program. 
 
SQZ TACs for Immune Tolerance 
 We are developing our immune tolerance program to selectively suppress unwanted immune responses. These responses can occur as a result of autoimmune diseases, such as T1D and celiac disease, where the body attacks its own tissues and organs, or in the form of unwanted reactions to therapeutics, where the body mounts an immune response against a drug, such as auto antibodies associated with gene therapy and other biologics. We plan to select an indication for our first application with the TAC platform and conduct IND-enabling studies in 2021. 
 Broad immunosuppression is the current standard of care for patients who suffer from autoimmune diseases or experience adverse reactions to their life-saving drugs. Current treatments are often associated with long-term side effects, making patients more susceptible to certain types of infections and cancers. These patients would benefit from a therapy that is able to modulate only the undesired immune responses without influencing broader immune functions. With our ability to engineer RBCs into antigen carriers, we believe we can leverage naturally tolerogenic immune mechanisms to specifically suppress undesired immune responses and overcome challenges to current therapies. 
 The SQZ TAC platform is potentially applicable to many autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, as well as other applications with unwanted immune responses, such as antibody responses against biologics or gene therapy vectors. 
 
Cellular tolerance involves multiple mechanisms that modulate the activity of T cells and induction of suppressor or regulatory T cells (Tregs). SQZ TACs aim to delete or functionally inactivate (anergize) the number of antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that can mount an attack on the target. In addition, SQZ TACs aim to induce or expand antigen-specific Tregs that can selectively suppress immune responses. 
 In a series of preclinical studies we conducted to measure the frequency and performance of these types of T cells, we observed that SQZ TACs squeezed with OVA reduce the frequency of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to inactive control. In the study shown below, we treated 5 mice with SQZ TACs and 5 with inactive control. There was an average of 0.7% OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in the mice dosed with SQZ TACs as compared to an average of 3% in the control group. A similar observation was made in a separate preclinical study where we measured level and performance of CD4+ T cells after treatment with TACs squeezed with the model antigen OVA. We dosed 5 mice with SQZ TACs and 5 mice with inactive control. As shown in the graphs below, there was an average of 0.9% OVA-specific CD4 T cells in the mice dosed with SQZ TACs as compared to an average of 4.3% in mice dosed with inactive control. 
 In additional studies, we assessed if we could increase regulatory T cells (Tregs). We dosed 5 mice with SQZ TACs and 5 with inactive control. In these studies, in mice dosed with SQZ TACs, CD4 T cells converted to antigen-specific regulatory T cells three times higher than mice treated with control. 
 SQZ TACs Effect on CD8+ T Cells, CD4+ T Cells and T Regulatory Cells 
 
36

Suppressing CD8 and CD4 T cells is achieved through multiple pathways, including deletion and anergy. Deletion can be measured by assessing levels of apoptosis markers in cells, such as AnnexinV. Anergy, the exhaustion of the T cells and state of unresponsiveness to antigen, causes them to be less effective at immune attack and can be measured by the presence of negative regulators such as PD-1 markers. 
 In one study OT-I cells, the transgenic CD8+ T cells specific to OVA in mouse models, were transferred into a group of 10 mice and OT-II cells, the transgenic CD4+ T cells specific to OVA in mouse models, were transferred into a second group of 10 mice. Five mice in each group were treated with Ova-specific SQZ TACs (SQZ-TAC-OVA) on Day 1. On Day 5, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were evaluated for percentage of annexinV+ cells. SQZ-TACs more than doubled the percentage of Ova-specific apoptotic CD8 and CD4 T cells. Additionally, when measuring endogenous T cells to assess if the TACs are acting on antigen specific T cells or broadly, levels of apoptosis of endogenous T cells in the SQZ TAC treated groups were not significantly different than in untreated mice, demonstrating SQZ TACs were able to induce antigen specific T cell deletion. 
 
Impact of SQZ TACs on Apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells 
 

In the same study, on Day 5, antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were evaluated for the presence of PD-1 as a marker of exhaustion in 16 of the mice, 4 in each group. One animal from each group was dropped to keep the groups at the same number when one animal was unevaluable. Over 60% of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells in SQZ TAC-treated mice were exhausted, compared to less than 5% in untreated mice. SQZ TAC treated mice showed an average of over 40% of OVA-Specific CD4+ T cells that showed markers for anergy, compared to less than 5% in the untreated mice. The percentage of PD1+ endogenous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, after SQZ-TAC-OVA treatment was the same as untreated mice, demonstrating that SQZ TACs did not broadly induce markers of T cell anergy. 

37


Impact of SQZ TACs on Markers for Anergy of CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells 
 

We believe these data, together with the results from other preclinical studies we have conducted, suggest that SQZ TACs have the potential to decrease the T cells activated against a potential target and reduce their pathological functionality, and increase the number of regulatory T cells. These studies showed specific tolerance across multiple cellular mechanisms. 
 To determine if SQZ TACs could also impact antibody production, we assessed the ability of SQZ-TACs to prevent the clearance of biologic drugs in vivo and maintain the circulation of a foreign drug in mice. We observed that SQZ TAC treatment was able to prevent the clearance of a foreign material in mice by suppressing antibody production against the foreign material. 
 
SQZ-TAC-T1D 
 Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by the inability of the pancreas to produce insulin in response to hyperglycemia because of the death of insulin-producing β islet cells. T1D affects approximately 1.6 million people in the United States. The pathology in the majority of type 1 diabetes cases is thought to be driven by autoimmunity. Newly diagnosed symptomatic T1D patients may have sufficient cell functionality to remain insulin independent if treated soon after diagnosis. We are developing SQZ-TAC-T1D to explore the potential for SQZ TACs loaded with T1D-associated antigens to ameliorate immune activity targeting β islet cells to prevent further destruction of cells. 

38


We tested SQZ-TACs in an aggressive model of T1D using adoptive transfer of activated BDC2.5 transgenic T cells into NOD.SCID recipient mice. Ten mice were treated with SQZ TACs with T1D-specific antigen, p31, over the course of 4 days. An additional 9 mice were treated with TACs containing an antigen that is not associated with T1D, HEL, modeling a non-specific treatment control. Nine mice were untreated. Blood glucose levels were measured in the mice over the course of 80 days. Mice with two consecutive blood glucose readings over 250 mg/dL were considered diabetic. By day 8 all untreated mice and non-specifically treated mice had developed diabetes. SQZ- TAC-p31 delayed onset of diabetes by 42 to 80 days. 
 SQZ TACs Delayed Diabetes Onset in Mice 
 

In an additional study using this model, mice were administered two doses of SQZ-TAC-p31 or SQZ-TAC-HEL (non -specific TACs) on either day 0 or day 2. Pancreases were collected on day 15 after adoptive transfer (induction of diabetes) and scored for insulitis by a pathologist measured by marked mononuclear cells and islet cells infiltrate as shown below in the pancreas histograms. Animals that received non-specific treatment (SQZ-TAC-HEL) had marked numbers of mononuclear cell infiltrates with greater than 75% of the islet mass infiltrated, and occasional areas of islet cell degeneration. In contrast, animals treated with SQZ-TAC-p31 had the lowest score for insulitis with minimal to mild mononuclear cell infiltrates and less than 25% islet cell infiltrated. 
 
In a set of studies assessing the frequency of antigen-specific Treg in the pancreas of mice, mice had their pancreases harvested on Day 8. For each study, BDC2.5+ cells were pooled from groups of mice to reach a base of 106 cells for each data point. T1-D-specific Tregs were measured by Foxp3 positivity of the BDC2.5 cells present. SQZ-TAC-p31 treated mice showed over 5 times the number of TI-D specific Tregs over SQZ-TAC-HEL treated mice. 

39


Frequency of T1D-Specific Tregs in the Pancreas of SQZ-TAC Treated Mice 
 
We believe these disease model data, together with the results from other preclinical studies we have conducted, suggest that SQZ TACs have the potential to induce tolerance through multiple cellular mechanisms and that the SQZ TAC platform is potentially applicable to many autoimmune diseases and immune reactions. 
 SQZ-TAC-Biologics 
 Currently, there is a need for a solution to allow patients to receive as many doses of potentially immunogenic therapies (e.g. recombinant proteins, antibodies, or gene therapy vectors) to gain the full, durable benefit these treatments can provide. AAV vectors, for example, are used to deliver functional genes for gene therapies because they are non-pathogenic and do not integrate into the host genome. It is well documented that some patients build immunity to viral vectors and the transgene product, which limits the ability for patients to receive more than one dose of a gene therapy. In 2021, we and AskBio ended our research collaboration that we had established in 2019 related to the SQZ-TAC-AAV program. We believe that primary prevention of immune responses related to re-dosing potentially immunogenic therapies, including gene therapies, continues to be a potential opportunity for the SQZ TAC platform to impact patients.  
 Manufacturing 
 A significant challenge for existing cell therapies is the time, cost, and complexity of manufacturing. By potentially enabling rapid, cost-effective manufacturing of cell therapies, we believe SQZ technology could dramatically improve the feasibility and accessibility of cell therapies for many indications. 
 The current clinical SQZ process is a fully closed system that maintains aseptic process conditions. The system utilizes a disposable kit that includes the SQZ chips and incorporates integrity tests on the kit prior to the initiation of the manufacturing process. A SQZ chip has hundreds of parallel constriction channels. SQZ chips are designed to optimize the constriction and other parameters depending on the cell populations being squeezed. Our chips are all designed in-house and manufactured by multiple vendors. Our Cell Squeeze technology and therapeutics are covered by more than 30 patent families.

We outline our manufacturing advantages as follows: 
  
∎ | Production and administration. The production time for our current product candidate is under 24 hours, with a vein-to-vein time of approximately one week, compared to current cell therapies, which can have vein-to-vein times of four to six weeks. The SQZ product candidate is then administered to the patient via a simple syringe push. We are also developing a point-of-care system that we expect will further reduce this vein-to-vein time and provide the ability to create a patient product at the treatment center.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Scalability. We believe that the simplicity of the microfluidic system that squeezes cells allows for robust parallelization and scale up. In its current clinical manufacturing implementation, the core component of our technology is our SQZ chip, which is approximately the size of a postage stamp and is made up of hundreds of parallel channels that enable it to process up to 10 billion patient cells per minute.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Cost efficiency. We believe that eliminating the need for viral vectors and multi-day manufacturing could dramatically cut costs relative to current cell therapies and enable expansion into areas where current cell-engineering approaches are cost prohibitive. We anticipate manufacturing costs for SQZ-PBMC-HPV will be approximately 10 times lower per dose at commercial scale compared to currently marketed cell therapies. In future iterations, the point-of-care system could potentially reduce costs even further.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The process for our SQZ APCs is shown below. 
 

As summarized above, beyond our manufacturing process, a critical part of our ability to rapidly turn around the patient product is the release testing the FDA has accepted as part of our ongoing clinical trial. Because the system is fully closed we are able to reduce environmental and sterility tests to be more rapid and efficient. 
 All patient lots manufactured as of December 31, 2020 have been manufactured in under 24 hours, yielded multiple doses and every patient had successful manufacturing of their SQZ APCs. The cell viability of the patient lots manufactured varied by 15% or less across all of the patients indicating low inter-patient variability. 
 We are currently working to automate the additional steps in the process to create a point-of-care system to further reduce the manufacturing time and cost. We are integrating upstream and downstream manufacturing operations with our Cell Squeeze system to create a fully closed, automated system suitable for on-site cell therapy production without a cleanroom. This decentralized manufacturing approach is designed to enable rapid access to a cell-therapy intervention at community sites or field clinics, reduce treatment time from days to hours and improve patient access. 
 

41

A prototype of the point-of-care system is in development and we expect it will be ready for initial preclinical testing in the second half of 2021. As with our current system, the point-of-care system will be a part of the manufacturing of cell therapies and we believe it will not be regulated as a device. We plan to work with regulatory authorities on integrating necessary quality testing, ensuring bridging studies for any products that would move to this system and any other potential requirements. 
 
By reducing the burden of high cost and time, we believe we can present cell therapies as a more attractive and accessible treatment approach for physicians and patients. We also see these advantages as the foundation of allowing efficacy and patient need to be the primary factor in the treatment paradigm. We believe that by allowing biology to drive the decision of what therapy to use, and with potentially no cost or additional health or economic consequences, we can ensure patients receive the treatment designed to impart a significant therapeutic benefit. This is a particularly important consideration for implementation in indications outside oncology and/or different geographies and healthcare systems. 
 Collaboration, Research and License Agreements 
 Roche Collaboration 
 In October 2018, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Roche Collaboration Agreement, under which we are collaborating with Hoffman-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., or together, Roche, in the development and commercialization of certain nucleated cell therapy product candidates that incorporate antigens for the treatment of oncologic indications in accordance with mutually agreed upon collaboration plans. The Roche Collaboration Agreement enhanced, replaced and terminated a 2015 collaboration agreement between us and Roche. 
 We agreed, under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, to collaborate with Roche in the development of a cell therapy for oncologic indications made from PBMCs. The initial mutually selected antigen target is HPV, which is the focus of our ongoing SQZ-PBMC-HPV Phase 1 clinical trial. We also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to mutually select additional antigens to develop collaboratively. For each mutually selected antigen (including HPV with respect to SQZ-PBMC-HPV), we are responsible for conducting all preclinical research, and all development activities occurring prior to achieving clinical proof of concept for a product candidate containing the antigen, generally through a Phase 1 clinical trial. With respect to each mutually selected antigen, we granted Roche an option, exercisable after we deliver to Roche a clinical proof-of-concept report for a product candidate containing the antigen, to obtain an exclusive license, under our intellectual property, to research, develop, make, use, import, sell, and otherwise exploit the product candidate worldwide for the treatment of oncologic indications using our SQZ platform and a microfluidic chip. We retain all rights with respect to any product for which Roche does not timely exercise its option, and we may elect to commercialize any such product independently. Following Roche’s exercise of its option for a given product candidate, Roche is then responsible for the further clinical development of that product candidate, unless we exercise our option to exploit the product candidate in the United States, as further described below. Roche granted us an option, exercisable with respect to every alternating mutually selected antigen product for which Roche exercises its own option, beginning with the second, to retain the right under our intellectual property, and to obtain an exclusive license under Roche’s intellectual property, to research, develop, make, use, import, sell and otherwise exploit the antigen product candidate in the United States. If we exercise our option, the parties will mutually determine how responsibility for clinical development will be allocated between them, but Roche has the final say as to which party will run each global clinical study. We own any invention relating solely to a product containing a mutually selected antigen that is developed prior to the exercise of Roche’s option. If Roche exercises its option, Roche owns each subsequently developed invention relating solely to the antigen product candidate unless (a) it is solely related to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips, or (b) we exercise our option for the product candidate, in which case we will own such invention in the United States, and Roche will own such invention in all other jurisdictions. The budgeted development costs for these antigens are shared by the parties unless and until (i) Roche exercises its option with respect to a given antigen product candidate, and (ii) we do not exercise our option with respect to that antigen product candidate. In such case, Roche will be responsible for subsequent development costs. 
 Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, if we propose an antigen that is not ultimately mutually selected for collaborative development, we may still pursue the development of product candidates containing that antigen. For each such antigen that we select, we may be responsible for conducting all preclinical research, and all development activities occurring prior to achieving a clinical proof of concept for an antigen product candidate containing the antigen. With respect to each such antigen product, Roche grants us an exclusive license under its intellectual property to research, develop, make, use, import, sell, and otherwise exploit the product in the United States. If we achieve a proof of concept for a product candidate containing such antigen, Roche will, for a limited period of time, have the option to obtain an exclusive license under our intellectual property to research, develop, make, use, import, sell, and otherwise exploit the product candidate worldwide (subject to our rights to exploit the product in the United States) for the treatment of oncologic indications using our SQZ platform and a microfluidic chip. We retain all rights with respect to any product candidate for which Roche does not timely exercise its option. Following Roche’s exercise of its option, the parties will mutually determine how responsibility for clinical development will be allocated between them, but Roche has the final say as to which party will run each global clinical study. We own any invention relating solely to a product candidate containing an antigen we select that is developed prior to the exercise of Roche’s option. If Roche exercises its option, we will own in the United States, and Roche will own in all other jurisdictions, each subsequently developed invention relating solely to the antigen product candidate, unless such invention is solely related to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips. We are responsible for all 
 42

development costs for such antigen, unless and until Roche exercises its option, in which case the development costs subsequently incurred will be shared by the parties. 
 If Roche proposes an antigen and it is not ultimately mutually selected for collaborative development, Roche may elect to pursue the development of products containing that antigen. At Roche’s cost, we are responsible for conducting all preclinical research, and all development activities occurring prior to achieving a clinical proof of concept for an antigen product candidate containing such antigen. Roche is responsible for all clinical development after a proof of concept is achieved. Roche owns any invention relating solely to antigen product candidates containing such antigen, unless the invention is solely related to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips. Roche is responsible for all of the development costs for product candidates containing such antigens. 
 Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, preliminary collaboration plans with defined preclinical goals exist for eAPC development and for product candidates containing tumor cell lysate, or TCL. We are responsible for conducting preclinical research and development activities occurring prior to achieving a clinical proof of concept for each such product. With respect to each TCL product candidate, we granted Roche an option, exercisable after we deliver to Roche a clinical proof-of-concept report for such TCL product candidate, to obtain an exclusive license, under our intellectual property, to research, develop, make, use, import, sell, and otherwise exploit the product candidate worldwide for the treatment of oncologic indications using our SQZ platform and a microfluidic chip. We retain all rights with respect to any product candidate for which Roche does not timely exercise its option. Following Roche’s exercise of its option, Roche is then responsible for the further clinical development of each such product candidate. We own any invention relating solely to a TCL product candidate that is developed prior to the exercise of Roche’s option. If Roche exercises its option, each subsequently developed invention relating solely to a TCL product candidate will be owned by Roche, unless it is solely related to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips. Prior to the exercise of Roche’s option for a given tumor lysate product candidate, we will share the budgeted Phase 1 clinical costs of developing that product candidate, with Roche responsible for a mid double-digit percentage of the costs and SQZ responsible for the remainder. After Roche exercises its option, we may in some cases elect to opt out of sharing development costs; in such cases, Roche is thereafter responsible for all development costs incurred after exercising its option with respect to a given tumor lysate product candidate. If we do not timely elect to opt out of sharing development costs incurred after Roche’s option exercise, the costs will be shared, with Roche responsible for a mid double-digit percentage and SQZ responsible for the remainder. We will share certain profits and losses associated with the commercialization of TCL product candidates in the United States with Roche, unless we opt out of the cost sharing. 
 We own any invention developed under the Roche Collaboration Agreement that relates solely to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips. Any invention that does not relate solely to an antigen product candidate or TCL product candidate is owned by the party that invents it; if such invention is invented jointly, it is owned jointly by the parties. Each party may freely practice any jointly owned invention with no obligation to account to the other party. 
 Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, Roche paid us an upfront payment of $45 million. We are eligible to receive aggregate milestone payments on a product-by-product basis of up to $1.6 billion upon the achievement of specified milestones, consisting of up to $217.0 million of development milestone payments, up to $240.0 million of regulatory milestone payments and up to $1.2 billion of sales milestone payments. Roche has agreed to pay us yearly tiered royalties based on net sales of antigen and TCL product candidates. For each antigen product candidate for which Roche commercializes outside of the United States, and we commercialize in the United States, Roche will pay us tiered royalties on net sales of the product candidate outside of the United States at rates ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a mid-teens percentage, depending on net sales of the product candidate. For each such product, we will pay Roche tiered royalties on net sales of such product candidate in the United States at rates ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a mid-teens percentage, depending on net sales of the product candidate in the United States. For antigen product candidates selected by Roche, rather than mutually, Roche will pay us tiered royalties on worldwide net sales of such product candidate at rates ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a high single-digit percentage, depending on net sales of the product. For certain antigen product candidates with respect to which Roche commercializes worldwide, Roche will pay us tiered royalties at a rate ranging from a high single-digit percentage to a mid-teens percentage, depending on net sales of the product. No royalties will be due for SQZ antigens for which Roche does not exercise its option. For TCL product candidates, Roche will pay us tiered royalties on the aggregate net sales of all TCL products at rates ranging from either a mid single-digit percentage to a percentage in the low twenties, with the caveat that the rates for sales in the United States may instead range from a low teen percentage to a percentage in the mid twenties, depending on whether and when we opt out of sharing certain profits and costs of commercializing the TCL product candidate in the United States with Roche. 
 Either party may terminate the Roche Collaboration Agreement (a) in its entirety or on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis if the other party breaches materially and such breach remains uncured for 90 days, or (b) in its entirety for insolvency-related events involving the other party. We may terminate the Roche Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product or country-by country basis, if Roche or its affiliates or sublicensees commences an action challenging certain patent rights licensed to us and sublicensed to Roche. Roche may terminate the Roche Collaboration Agreement without cause (a) in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis with 60 days’ notice, if Roche is terminating prior to exercising an option under the agreement, (b) on a product-by-product basis with 90 days’ notice, if Roche is terminating after exercising an option under the agreement, (c) on a product-by-product basis or country-by-country basis with 180 days’ notice if Roche is terminating after exercising an option under the agreement, and such notice will become effective on or after the first commercial sale of the product. For any product candidate that is terminated, we may provide a continuation election notice to Roche, and, 
 43

for consideration, obtain from Roche all reasonably requested rights to such terminated product candidate, including the transfer of ownership of all INDs and regulatory approvals, and copies of data and reports relating to the product candidate, among other things. 
 MIT License Agreement 
 We exclusively license certain foundational technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Exclusive Patent License Agreement dated as of December 2, 2015, or the MIT License Agreement. The MIT License Agreement replaced an earlier Exclusive Patent License Agreement dated as of May 10, 2013, which was entered into in connection with the organization of the company. Under the MIT License Agreement, MIT granted us a worldwide, royalty bearing license to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease, and import products incorporating the patent rights and to develop use, sell, offer to sell and perform processes incorporating the patent rights for all research and therapeutic applications for the term of the MIT License Agreement. Our rights under the license are exclusive in our fields of use, except with respect to (a) MIT and Harvard University (which owns the patent rights jointly with MIT), each of which retain rights for research, teaching and educational purposes on their own behalf and on behalf of all other non-profit research institutions, (b) Howard Hughes Medical Institution, which has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, license to use the patent rights for its own research purposes and (c) the federal government, which retains a non-exclusive and non-transferrable license to practice any government-funded invention claimed in the patent rights, as provided by law. We also have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties, subject to written agreements containing similar protections of MIT and certain third-party beneficiaries as contained in the agreement. 
 We are required to use diligent efforts, or cause our affiliates or sublicensees to use diligent efforts, to develop licensed products, to introduce licensed products and processes into the commercial market and, thereafter, to make licensed products and processes reasonably available to the public. In addition, we are obligated to satisfy certain development and commercialization metrics and provide MIT with periodic progress reports. To date, we have met our diligence obligations under the agreement. For example, our collaboration with Roche and the commencement of our SQZ-PBMC-HPV trial meet clinical milestones under the agreement. After the fifth anniversary, and before the sixth anniversary, of the MIT License Agreement, the parties are obligated to discuss additional diligence obligations to continue the development and commercialization of licensed products and processes. 
 We are obligated to make certain payments to MIT including an up-front license issue fee, annual maintenance fees, clinical milestone payments, running royalties based on net sales (at a rate in the low single digits), reimbursement of patent costs, and sharing of sublicense income. In June of 2019, we agreed with MIT on a payment schedule for the sharing of certain amounts received by us from Roche. MIT prosecutes and maintains the patent rights in close consultation with us and our intellectual property counsel. We also provide certain indemnifications for liabilities arising from claims related to the exercise of our rights under the agreement. 
 Upon entering into the MIT License Agreement, we paid a nominal license issue fee. We agreed to pay MIT a nominal annual license maintenance fee for each calendar year. Each year’s annual license maintenance fee may be credited to running royalties due in the same calendar year. We also agreed to pay MIT milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to $1.8 million per licensed product or process that achieves certain clinical and regulatory milestones. Additionally, we agreed to pay royalties based on net sales of the licensed products or processes, at low single-digit rates that vary depending on whether sales are made in the therapeutic or research field. With respect to each sublicensee, we are obligated to pay MIT royalties equal to the lesser of (a) a low single-digit percentage of the sublicensee’s net sales and (b) 50% of the running royalties owed to us by the sublicensee. We also agreed to pay MIT a percentage in the mid teens of our annual sublicense income (which does not include income from royalties). 
 The license will remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the licensed patent rights. The agreement is terminable by us upon six months written notice, provided that we have paid all amounts due to MIT through such termination date, and by MIT for nonpayment of amounts due, our cessation of the business related to the agreement, our uncured material breach of the agreement or a challenge initiated by us of the validity, enforceability or non-infringement of the patents licensed to us under the agreement. In the event of any dispute relating to the agreement, either party may initiate mediation to facilitate a negotiated settlement prior to seeking other legal remedies. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we believe are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field. 
 Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: (i) obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; (ii) defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular our patents rights; (iii) preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and (iv) operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates or any future products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. 
 Patents 
 The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. We also 
 44

cannot ensure that patents will issue with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our owned or licensed patents or future patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our products will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to 5 years but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only 1 patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering the use of products from our intellectual property may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our use of product candidates or the product candidate itself receives FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved use or product candidate. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 Cell Squeeze Technology 
 Our patent portfolio for our Cell Squeeze approach includes more than 30 patent families that we own or have licensed, with potential expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2041. As of February 28, 2021, our portfolio consisted of over 115 issued U.S. and foreign patents (including over 80 issued patents in various European countries) and over 160 pending U.S., Patent Cooperation Treaty (international), and foreign patent applications. A number of these patent families provide coverage for one or more of our SQZ APC, SQZ AAC and SQZ TAC platforms. Fifteen of the patent families apply to the SQZ APC platform with expiration dates ranging from 2032 to 2041. Twelve of the patent families apply to the SQZ AAC platform with expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2041. Ten of the patent families apply to the SQZ TAC platform with expiration dates ranging from 2030 to 2041. As of February 28, 2021, our patent portfolio includes various issued patents and pending applications with claims directed to systems, devices, composition of matter and methods of use, including methods of inducing an immune response or treating cancer, related to our Cell Squeeze technology for our platforms and product candidates, including our HPV product candidates. 
Trademarks 
 We currently own 13 allowed or registered trademarks in various jurisdictions worldwide, including four registered trademarks in the United States. We have 12 pending trademark applications worldwide, including 10 in the United States. Our trademark portfolio includes Cell Squeeze, SQZ, SQZ Biotech, Empower Cells to Change Lives, SQZ Therapeutics, SQZ Activating Antigen Carriers, SQZ Antigen Carriers, SQZ Tolerizing Antigen Carriers, SQZ TX, SQZ-AC, SQZ-AAC, and SQZ-TAC, which are pending or registered in the United States and certain other countries. 
Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information 
 We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with applicable collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. 
Competition 
 As a clinical-stage biotechnology company, we face competition from a wide array of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. This competition include both small companies and large companies with greater financial and technical resources and longer operating histories than our own. We also compete with the intellectual property, technology and product development efforts of academic, governmental and private research institutions. 
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they establish collaborative arrangements with large companies. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of any products that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any 
 45

of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours and may commercialize products more quickly than we do. 
 We expect to compete with companies using other cell engineering approaches, such as electroporation and viral vectors. Companies that are engineering cells with some of these methods include Rubius Therapeutics, which is genetically engineering red blood cells, Fate Therapeutics, which is programing hematopoietic cells and other biotechnology companies working on single cell types. 
 We expect our lead product candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, will compete with other product candidates for the treatment of HPV+ cancers. While there are currently no FDA-approved therapies that target HPV for HPV+ cancers, there are multiple competing clinical-stage product candidates in development targeting HPV+ cancers. These product candidates include genetically modified T cell therapies in clinical development by Kite, peptide vaccines in clinical development by ISA Pharma, biologics being developed by Cue Biopharma, therapeutics being developed by Rubius and nucleic acid vaccines in clinical development by BioNTech and clinical development by Inovio. Therapies that are not specific to HPV are also being explored and applied to HPV+ tumors, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes developed by Iovance Biotherapeutics and immune checkpoint inhibitors that are approved for treatment in multiple solid tumors. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biological product candidates such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
 The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
∎ | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA, supervision of certain human gene transfer trials may also require evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to the public health or the environment, and such assessment may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. 
 46

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
∎ | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for products that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions regarding approval. 
 47

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval or licensure of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. A fast track-designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. 
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. 
 In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a product as a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical 
 48

trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. 
 Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
∎ | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


∎ | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


∎ | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 49

 
∎ | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∎ | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 Our product candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. 
 If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel candidates such as our product candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug or biologic candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both 
 50

products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document intended to further assist sponsors of therapeutic products and sponsors of in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of these products. 
 The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of therapeutic candidates such as those we are developing involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and pre-clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are also subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. In addition, as part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. 
 If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. 
 If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue an order denying approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable order. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws may include, without limitation, the U.S. federal anti-kickback , fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations as well as similar state and foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, reputational harm, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. 
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. In the U.S., the Medicare program, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency 
 51

within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, is increasingly used as a model for how commercial and other governmental payors develop their own coverage and reimbursement policies for new drugs and biologics. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product, however, does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
 In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more frequently challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products and biologics, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. By way of example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which reduced to $0 the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was effectively repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2029 absent additional Congressional action. 
 52

Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2029 absent additional Congressional action. 
 There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget for fiscal year 2020 contain further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low income patients. 
 Further regulatory changes include passage of the Right to Try Act on May 30, 2018. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new medical products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program.

 As of December 31, 2020, we had 98 full-time employees, including 29 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 71 employees are engaged in clinical, research and development, product development and quality assurance activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel. In particular, we depend upon the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management to partner effectively as a team, and who provide strategic direction, develop our business, manage our operations and maintain a cohesive and stable work environment. We also rely on highly qualified and skilled employees with technical expertise in operations, scientific knowledge, and quality management experience in order to operate our business successfully. Led by our experienced management team, we believe our strong culture and the disciplined execution of our employees will form the foundation of our success.Available Information
