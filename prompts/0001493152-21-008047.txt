Background
 
Business Overview
 
Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sigyn” or the “Company”) was established on October 29, 2019 in the State of Delaware. We are a development-stage therapeutic technology company that is headquartered in San Diego, California USA. Our primary focus is directed toward a significant unmet need in global health: the treatment of acute life-threatening inflammatory conditions that are precipitated by Cytokine Storm Syndrome (“The Cytokine Storm” or “Cytokine Release Syndrome”) and not addressed with approved drug therapies. Cytokine Storm Syndrome is a dysregulated immune response that can be induced by a wide range of infectious and non-infectious conditions. A hallmark of the Cytokine Storm is an over-production of inflammatory cytokines, which can destroy tissue, trigger multiple-organ failure and cause death.
 
On October 19, 2020, Reign Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Registrant”) completed a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with our organization (Sigyn Therapeutics) that resulted in the registrant acquiring 100% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for 75% of the fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Registrant’s common stock outstanding (the “Acquisition”). In conjunction with the transaction, the Registrant changed its name to Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. pursuant to an amendment to its articles of incorporation that was filed with the State of Delaware. Subsequently, the Registrant’s trading symbol was changed to SIGY. The Acquisition was treated as a “tax-free exchange” under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and resulted in the Sigyn corporate entity (established on October 29, 2019) to become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant. Among the conditions for closing the acquisition, the Registrant extinguished all previously reported liabilities, its preferred class of shares, and all stock purchase options. As a result, the reported liabilities totaling $3,429,516 converted into a total of 7,907,351 common shares. Additionally, assets held on the books of Reign Resources Corporation, such as Gem inventory, was kept in the Company and therefore recorded as assets on the Share Exchange date. The Registrant’s Board of Directors appointed James A. Joyce and Craig P. Roberts to serve as members of the Registrant’s Board of Directors upon closing of the Acquisition.
 
As of April 5, 2021, we have a total 35,248,513 shares issued and outstanding, of which 9,561,513 shares are held by non-affiliate shareholders.
 
About Sigyn Therapy
 
Sigyn Therapy is a novel blood purification technology designed to mitigate cytokine storm syndrome through the broad-spectrum depletion of inflammatory targets from the bloodstream. Sigyn Therapy’s mechanism of action allows for it to be implemented on the established infrastructure of dialysis and CRRT machines that are already located in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Cytokine Storm Syndrome is a hallmark of sepsis, which is the most common cause of in-hospital deaths and claims more lives each year than all forms of cancer combined. Virus induced cytokine storm (VICS) is associated with high mortality and is a leading cause of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) deaths. Other therapeutic opportunities include but are not limited to bacteria induced cytokine storm (BICS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute forms of liver failure such as Hepatic Encephalopathy, which is associated with elevated levels of toxins and inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream.
Recent Clinical Disclosures
 
On December 1, 2020, we reported the results of an in vitro study that validated the ability of Sigyn Therapy to simultaneously deplete a broad-spectrum of critical inflammatory targets from human blood plasma. In the study, Sigyn Therapy reduced the presence of endotoxin and relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines, which included Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a). Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) is a well-known inflammatory trigger implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock resulting from gram-negative bacterial infections. The dysregulated over-production of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a is known to induce organ failure and cause death. An objective of the study was to rebalance elevated cytokine levels and optimize the elimination of endotoxin from human blood plasma. The study was conducted in triplicate over four-hour time periods with a pediatric version of Sigyn Therapy. Average reduction of endotoxin load peaked at 83% during the studies. The average reduction of IL-1b was 69%, IL-6 reduction was 59% and TNF-a reduction was 57% during the four-hour studies. We plan to incorporate this data into an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) that we expect to submit to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to the end of the 2021 calendar year. Our IDE submission will request permission to initiate U.S. human feasibility studies with a primary objective to demonstrate that Sigyn Therapy can be safely administered to subjects diagnosed with a Cytokine Storm Syndrome related condition. There is no assurance that FDA will approve our IDE submission to permit human studies.

We are also evaluating the ability of Sigyn Therapy to address CytoVesicles that transport inflammatory cytokine cargos throughout the bloodstream. Based on recent peer-reviewed publications and emerging scientific evidence, we believe the simultaneous clearance of circulating CytoVesicles, endotoxin and inflammatory cytokines may overcome the limitations of previous drug and medical device candidates to treat sepsis and other life-threatening inflammatory conditions.
 
On January 6, 2021, we disclosed the results of an in vitro pilot study that modeled the ability of the adsorbent components we incorporate within Sigyn Therapy to address CytoVesicles. CytoVesicles (extracellular vesicles that transport inflammatory cytokine cargos) participate in concert with freely circulating cytokines to further escalate the Cytokine Storm. CytoVesicles have previously been elusive targets for extracorporeal blood purification therapies as they can be 20-50 times larger than cytokines themselves. In our in vitro pilot study, 104 nanometer liposomes were utilized as a model system to assess the ability of Sigyn Therapy’s adsorbent components to deplete CytoVesicles from human blood plasma. After a two-hour interaction with our cocktail of adsorbent components, liposome concentrations in human blood plasma were reduced ~90%. Previously published studies have validated liposomes as a model for the isolation of extracellular vesicles from blood based on the similarity of their size and structural characteristics. There is no assurance that any in vitro study outcome of Sigyn Therapy or its components will translate into similar performance outcomes in human studies.
 
Sigyn Therapy Mechanism of Action
 
Sigyn Therapy is a novel blood purification technology whose broad-spectrum mechanism of action establishes a basis to treat an expansive pipeline of candidate indications. Incorporated within Sigyn Therapy is a “cocktail” of adsorbent components that have been formulated to optimize the depletion of inflammatory cytokines, toxins, CytoVesicles, endotoxin and potentially other pathogenic factors that are known to induce Cytokine Storm Syndrome.
 
In the medical field, the term “cocktail” is a reference to the simultaneous administration of multiple drugs (a drug cocktail) with differing mechanisms of actions. While drug cocktails have begun to emerge as potential mechanisms to treat cancer, they are proven life-saving countermeasures to treat HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis-C virus infection. However, dosing of multi-drug agent cocktails is limited by toxicity and adverse events that can result from deleterious drug interactions. Sigyn Therapy is not constrained by such limitations as our active components are not introduced into the body. As a result, we are able to incorporate a substantial dose of multiple adsorbents, each with differing mechanisms and capabilities to optimize Sigyn Therapy’s ability to calm the cytokine storm that underlies life-threatening inflammatory conditions.
 
Beyond our advantageous dosing strategy, the components of our adsorbent cocktail have surface characteristics and structures that permit Sigyn Therapy to bind or adsorb inflammatory targets that exceed 100 nanometers in diameter. Whereas the two most broadly deployed devices to treat acute life-threatening inflammatory conditions are limited to addressing either a single molecular target (endotoxin) or a broad-spectrum of inflammatory cytokines below 5 nanometers in diameter.
 
Beyond these mechanistic advantages, Sigyn Therapy is a single-use, “blood-in-blood-out device” that can be deployed on the established infrastructure of dialysis and CRRT machines that are already located in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Sigyn Therapy isolates inflammatory targets from the bloodstream to optimize their interaction with our cocktail of adsorbent components. We believe this mechanism to be a further competitive advantage as our adsorbent components are restricted from contacting or activating blood cells.
 
From a technical perspective, Sigyn Therapy converges the plasma separation function of hollow-fiber plasmapheresis devices with the expansive capacity of adsorbent components housed in the extra-lumen space (outside the fiber walls, yet inside the outer shell of the cartridge) to optimize the elimination of inflammatory targets in a low-shear force environment without interacting with blood cells. As blood flows into our device, the plasma components along with inflammatory targets move through the porous walls (≈200 nm) of the hollow-fibers (2500+ fibers) due to the blood side pressure. Because the hollow fiber bundle creates a resistance to the flow of blood, a pressure drop is created along the length of the device such that the blood-side pressure is higher at the blood inlet and lower at the blood outlet. This causes plasma to flow away from the blood and into the extra-lumen space (home of our adsorbent components) along the proximal third of the fiber bundle. In the distal third of the fiber bundle, the pressure gradient is reversed, which causes the plasma to flow backward through the fiber walls where it is recombined with cellular components without the inflammatory initiators, cytokines or toxins that have been bound or captured by the cocktail of adsorbent components housed in the extra-lumen space. Based on blood flow rates of 200ml/min, a patient’s entire blood volume can pass through Sigyn Therapy approximately 10 times during a four-hour treatment period.

Market Overview
 
Cytokine Storm Syndrome is a hallmark of sepsis, which is the most common cause of in-hospital deaths and claims more lives each year than all forms of cancer combined. Virus induced cytokine storm (VICS) is associated with high mortality and is a leading cause of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) deaths. Other therapeutic opportunities include but are not limited to bacteria induced cytokine storm (BICS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute forms of liver failure such as Hepatic Encephalopathy, which is associated with elevated levels of toxins and inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream. The annual market opportunity for a therapeutic strategy to prevent or mitigate the Cytokine Storm has been reported to exceed $20 billion.
 
In April 2020, the FDA published the following statement, which supports the regulatory advancement of anti-cytokine blood purification technologies: “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the removal of pro-inflammatory cytokines may ameliorate the cytokine storm due to the overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, in turn, provide clinical benefit.”
 
The Cytokine Storm Precipitates Sepsis
 
Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In January of 2020, a report entitled; “Global, Regional, and National Sepsis Incidence and Mortality, 1990-2017: Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study,” was published in the Journal Lancet. The publication reported 48.9 million cases of sepsis and 11 million deaths in 2017. In that same year, an estimated 20.3 million sepsis cases and 2.9 million deaths were among children younger than 5-years old. The report referenced that sepsis kills more people around the world than all forms of cancer combined. In the United States, sepsis was reported to be the most common cause of in-hospital deaths with annual costs exceeding $24 billion.
 
To date, more than 100 human studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and benefit of candidate drugs to treat sepsis. With one brief exception (Xigris, Eli Lilly), none of these studies resulted in a market approved therapy. As the treatment of sepsis remains elusive for therapeutic drug agents, an increased understanding of the complex mechanisms that underlie sepsis support the potential of therapeutic strategies that modulate a broad-spectrum of inflammatory factors.
 
As a result, an increased focus has been directed toward extracorporeal blood purification, with an emphasis on devices that improve immune homeostasis through the depletion of circulating inflammatory mediators. Given the pivotal role of endotoxin and cytokine production in sepsis, it is anticipated that the simultaneous depletion of these inflammatory factors may establish the basis for an efficacious strategy. We also believe that inflammatory cytokine cargos transported by CytoVesicles represent a novel, yet important therapeutic target.
 
Virus Induced Cytokine Storm (VICS)
 
Virus Induced Cytokine Storm (VICS) is associated with high mortality rates and is defined by an excess production of inflammatory cytokines in response to a virulent viral infection. As the vast majority of human viruses are not addressed with a corresponding drug or vaccine, there is an urgent and ongoing need for therapies that mitigate the Cytokine Storm that can be initiated by a broad-spectrum of viral pathogens. At present, VICS is a leading cause of COVID-19 deaths and often precipitates other life-threatening conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which are highly prevalent in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
 
In March of 2020, Yale University researchers reported that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines correlated with the severity of COVID-19 infection and increased mortality rates. Inversely, the researchers reported that declining levels of these same cytokines are associated with patient recovery. In April of 2020, the FDA established pro-inflammatory cytokine reduction as a clinical endpoint to ameliorate the cytokine storm induced by a viral infection.
 
Beyond COVID-19, virus induced Cytokine Storms are associated with many of the 250,000 to 500,000 global deaths that result from severe influenza infections each year. In some years, the death toll resulting from influenza rises to pandemic proportions. In modern history, the best-known example is the H1N1 Spanish Flu of 1918 which caused the deaths of more than 50 million individuals. Other deadly influenza outbreaks included the 1957 H2N2 Asian influenza, the 1968 H3N2 Hong Kong influenza, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza. Between 1997 and 2014, several epizootic avian influenza viruses (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8) crossed the species barrier to cause increased human death tolls.

In recent years, virus induced Cytokine Storm was associated with high mortality resulting from the 2003 SARS virus outbreak and the 2014-15 Ebola virus outbreak. VICS is also reported to play a role in mosquito-borne viral infections, including severe Dengue infections, which result in approximately 40,000 deaths each year.
 
We believe that Sigyn Therapy can serve as a first-line countermeasure to mitigate Cytokine Storm Syndrome resulting from emerging viral outbreaks that are increasingly being fueled by a confluence of global warming, urban crowding and intercontinental travel. As it is improbable for post-exposure drugs and vaccines to be developed, proven effective, manufactured and delivered at the outset of a pandemic, we believe there will be an ongoing demand for therapies to address virus induced Cytokine Storm Syndrome. Additionally, we believe that Sigyn Therapy aligns with U.S. Government initiatives that support the development of broad-spectrum medical countermeasures that mitigate the impact of emerging pandemic threats, yet also have viability in established disease indications.
 
Bacteria Induced Cytokine Storm (BICS)
 
Gram-negative bacteria infections are a significant global health issue due to their resistance to antibiotic therapy. In severe infections, bacteria shed endotoxins into the circulatory system, which are potent drivers of Cytokine Storm Syndrome. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over two million infections are caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year in the United States, resulting in approximately 23,000 deaths. From a national biodefense perspective, four species of bacteria have been classified as “Category A” biological threats as they pose a high risk to national security and public health. These include Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Clostridium botulinum toxin (botulism), Yersinia pestis (plague) and Francisella tularensis (tularemia). The extracorporeal elimination of circulating endotoxin has previously been demonstrated to help rebalance the innate immune system, decrease levels of inflammatory mediators and improve vascular function and hemodynamics.
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Treatment Opportunity
 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a form of respiratory failure characterized by the rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. ARDS is often associated with multiple organ failure and is known to be precipitated by a variety of clinical disorders, including Cytokine Storm Syndrome. Globally, ARDS is associated with approximately 3 million deaths each year and has a mortality rate of 30-50%.
Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)
 
Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) is a life-threatening complication of liver cirrhosis that results in 25,000-40,000 U.S. hospital admissions each year. The three-year survival rate following the first episode of HE is approximately 15%. HE severity has been correlated with highly elevated serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and toxins. At present, we have not conducted studies that validate the ability of Sigyn Therapy to deplete HE related toxins from blood or blood plasma.
 
Bridge-To-Liver Transplant
 
There is a significant need for a medical device that can reduce the circulating presence of inflammatory cytokines and toxins in patients with liver failure. Based on these requirements, Sigyn Therapy is a candidate strategy to stabilize or extend the life of a patient prior to the identification of a matched liver for transplantation. Otherwise known as a bridge-to-liver transplant. In 2017, 8,082 U.S. patients received a liver transplant and 13,885 patients were on the waiting list for a liver transplant. The average cost associated with a liver transplant is $577,100 USD. As with Hepatic Encephalopathy, we have not conducted studies that validate the ability of Sigyn Therapy to deplete deleterious toxins associated with liver failure.
 
Other Potential Opportunities
 
Cytokine Storm Syndrome may also result from trauma, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, adverse drug reactions, cancer immunotherapies, cancer cachexia, acute kidney injury (AKI) and severe pneumonia.

Competition
 
Our primary focus is directed toward treating acute life-threatening inflammatory conditions that are precipitated by Cytokine Storm Syndrome and not addressed with approved drug therapies. As a result of COVID-19, single-mechanism drugs to inhibit specific cytokine targets are being clinically evaluated in COVID-19 infected individuals. The candidate targets for these drug agents include IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a, which are simultaneously addressed by Sigyn Therapy based on recent in vitro study outcomes.
 
Emerging and historic evidence reveals the considerable challenge to temper the Cytokine Storm through the inhibition of a single cytokine target. In April of 2020, an article in the Journal Nature reported 14 different inflammatory cytokines to be highly elevated in bloodstream of COVID-19 patients. In May of 2020, Stanford researchers reported that elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients are consistent with those observed in critically ill (non-COVID-19) sepsis and ARDS patients, which are conditions for which anti-cytokine drugs have previously been unable to demonstrate benefit in clinical studies. Specific to sepsis, more than 70 human studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and benefit of candidate drugs. With one brief exception (Xigris, Eli Lilly), none of these studies resulted in a market approved therapy.
 
In the absence of safe and effective drugs to address Cytokine Storm related conditions, we anticipate that the market for therapeutic blood purification technologies to address Cytokine Storm Syndrome will be extremely competitive.
 
The most broadly deployed blood purification technologies to address life-threatening inflammatory conditions are the Toraymyxn device from Toray Industries and the CytoSorb device from CytoSorbents Corporation. While not yet market cleared in the United States, these industry-pioneering technologies are approved for use in more than 40 countries, have been administered to hundreds of thousands of patients, are the subject of hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and are being evaluated to treat severe COVID-19 infections. However, the mechanism of action of each of these technologies differs substantially.
 
The Toraymyxin device houses an immobilized antibiotic agent that has a high specificity to bind circulating endotoxin, which is a potent activator of cytokine storm syndrome induced by gram-negative bacterial infections. However, Toraymyxin does not address inflammatory cytokines or CytoVesicles. Conversely, the CytoSorb device incorporates an adsorbent bead that depletes inflammatory cytokines from the bloodstream but does not address endotoxin or CytoVesicles.
 
We believe that Sigyn Therapy’s ability to address inflammatory cytokines, endotoxin and CytoVesicles provides us with a significant competitive advantage that we plan to demonstrate in human clinical studies. However, there is no assurance that we will advance human clinical studies that demonstrate safety and efficacy of our technology.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
At present, we do not market or sell any therapeutic products. We plan to establish relationships with organizations that have established distribution channels into markets that might be served by Sigyn Therapy should it receive market clearance from FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies.
Intellectual Property
 
We own the intellectual property rights to pending royalty-free patents that have been assigned to us by our co-founders, James A. Joyce and Craig P. Roberts. We have also received a “Notice of Allowance” from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) related to the use of Sigyn Therapeutics, Sigyn Therapy and the protection of our corporate logo. We plan to continually expand our intellectual property portfolio and protect trade secrets that are not the subject of patent submissions. However, there is no assurance that the claims of current pending and future patent applications will result in issued patents.

Government Regulation
 
In the United States, Sigyn Therapy is subject to regulation by the FDA and other healthcare agencies. Should we seek to commercialize Sigyn Therapy outside the United States, we expect to face comparable international regulatory oversight. Based on published guidance by FDA, we anticipate Sigyn Therapy to be a Class III medical device whose regulatory jurisdiction will be the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the FDA branch that oversees the market approval of medical devices. As a Class III device, we are subject to a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) submission pathway with CDRH. The approval of PMA application to support market clearance of Sigyn Therapy will require extensive data, which includes but is not limited to technical documents, preclinical studies, human clinical trials, the establishment of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMA) standards and labeling that fulfills FDA’s requirement to demonstrate reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of a medical device product. There is no assurance that Sigyn Therapy will be demonstrated to be a safe and effective product to treat any life-threatening inflammatory condition precipitated by Cytokine Storm Syndrome.
 
Additionally, we must comply with applicable laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, storage, distribution, advertising and promotion, and post-marketing surveillance reporting for medical devices. Failure to comply with these applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Our failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
Manufacturing and Procurement
 
We are advancing a manufacturing relationship with an FDA registered Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) to establish GMP compliant manufacturing to support human clinical studies and potential commercialization should we receive clearance to market Sigyn Therapy. We plan to establish manufacturing procedure specifications that define each stage of our manufacturing, inspection and testing processes and the control parameters or acceptance criteria that apply to each activity that result in the production of our technology.
 
We have also established relationships with industry vendors that provide components necessary to manufacture our device. Should the relationship with an industry vendor be interrupted or discontinued, we believe that alternate component suppliers can be identified to support the continued manufacturing of our product. However, delays related to interrupted or discontinued vendor relationships could adversely impact our business.
 
Research and Product Development
 
We have sourced our research and product development activities, which include the performance of in vitro validation studies, pre-GMP product assembly and manufacturing through an organization with extensive experience in advancing extracorporeal blood purification technologies. At present, we do not plan to build and staff our own research and product development facility.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
At present, our operations are not subject to any environmental laws or regulations.
 
Employees
 
We have 2 full-time employees and no part-time employees as of the date of this filing. We have an employer contribution for healthcare, but we do not provide pension, annuity, insurance, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. To conserve cash and resources, we utilize consultants on an as-needed basis to provide various functions. Additionally, we also contract with clinical and research organizations to support the advancement of Sigyn Therapy.
