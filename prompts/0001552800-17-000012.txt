 Overview
 ﻿
 The Tile Shop was founded in 1985. We are a specialty retailer of manufactured and natural stone tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States. Our assortment includes over 4,000 products from around the world that consist of natural stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass, cement, wood look, and metal tiles. Natural stone products include marble, granite, quartz, sandstone, travertine, slate, and onyx tiles. The majority of our tile products are sold under our proprietary Rush River and Fired Earth brand names. We purchase our tile products, accessories and tools directly from our network of vendors. We manufacture our own setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout and sealers under our Superior brand name, as well as work with other vendors to manufacture private label products. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 123 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia, with an average size of approximately 21,100 square feet. We also sell our products on our website.
 ﻿
 We believe that our long-term vendor relationships, together with our design, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enable us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality products to our customers, who are primarily homeowners and professionals, at competitive prices. We have invested significant resources to develop our proprietary brands and product sources and believe that we are a leading retailer of stone and ceramic tiles, accessories, and related materials in the United States.
 ﻿
 In 2016, we reported net sales and income from operations of $324.2 million and $32.9 million, respectively. Our 2015 and 2014 net sales were $293.0 million and $257.2 million, respectively, and our 2015 and 2014 income from operations was $29.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively. We opened nine new stores and relocated two stores in 2016 and intend to open twelve to fifteen new stores in 2017. As of the end of fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we had total assets of $265.3 million and $245.0 million, respectively.

 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 We believe that the following factors differentiate us from our competitors and position us to continue to grow our specialty retailer business.
 ﻿
 Inspiring Customer Experience –  In each store, our products are brought to life by showcasing a broad array of the items we offer in up to 50 different vignettes of bathrooms, kitchens, fireplaces, foyers, and other distinct spaces. Our stores are spacious, well-lit, and organized by product type to simplify our customers’ shopping experience.
 ﻿
 Broad Product Assortment at Attractive Prices – We offer over 4,000 manufactured and natural tile products, setting and maintenance materials, accessories, and tools. We are able to maintain competitive prices by purchasing tile and accessories directly from producers and manufacturing our own setting and maintenance materials.
 ﻿
 Customer Service and Satisfaction – Our sales personnel are highly-trained and knowledgeable about the technical and design aspects of our products. We offer weekly do-it-yourself classes in all of our stores. In addition, we provide one-on-one installation training as required to meet customer needs. We accept returns up to six months following the date of the sale, with no restocking fees.
 ﻿
 Worldwide Sourcing Capabilities – We have long-standing relationships with our tile vendors throughout the world and work with them to design products exclusively for us. We believe that these direct relationships differentiate us from our competitors.
 ﻿
 Proprietary Branding – We sell the majority of our products under our proprietary brand names, which help us to differentiate our products from those of our competitors. We offer products across a range of price points and quality levels that allow us to target discrete market segments and to appeal to diverse groups of customers.
 ﻿
 Centralized Distribution System – We service our retail locations from five distribution centers. Our distribution centers, located in Michigan, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Virginia, and Wisconsin, are positioned to cost effectively service our existing stores.

Strategic Plan
 ﻿
 Key elements of our strategy include:
 ﻿
 Retail Talent Development – We previously made investments to improve our hiring, management and development training practices which have resulted in significant reductions in sales associate turnover and increased our average store manager tenure. The improvements in turnover and store manager tenure have proven to contribute to an increase in comparable store sales and store profitability. We plan to continue placing an emphasis on cultivating talent in our stores through recruiting, training programs and a lucrative career path. We believe the ongoing emphasis placed in these areas will continue to reduce turnover and produce the next generation of store leaders to support our long-term growth plans.
 ﻿
 Grow Professional Sales – During 2016, our initiatives focused on the professional customer that resulted in a significant increase in professional customer sales relative to total company sales. The professional customer includes tile contractors, custom home builders and designers. Key elements of this strategy included joining national and local trade organizations, developing marketing strategies, hosting in-store events, enhancing our product assortment of tool products and refining our credit policies. We believe that our value propositions including a six month return policy, no restocking fees, convenient store hours, tiered discounts, product availability, broad assortment, private label setting materials, in-house credit, free design support and job site delivery are un-paralleled in the marketplace. Our professional strategy enables our store associates to develop relationships with professionals in their trade area. Our corporate marketing team supports the stores by developing traffic and “leads” through trade organization memberships, direct marketing, co-hosting events in our showrooms and other forms of digital marketing. We continuously expand our product assortment and merchandising square footage of installation materials and tools to meet the changing and growing needs of our professional customers. We have also implemented training programs and a standard operating processes to assist new store sales associates to quickly and successfully develop revenues from professional customers. Creating awareness and increasing the frequency of professional visits to our stores continue to be important elements of our revenue growth plans in 2017.
 ﻿
 Strong Execution of Store Unit Growth – We believe we have exceptional opportunities to continue to add stores in existing markets and expand into new markets. We plan to increase our existing store base by 8 to 12 percent each year over the next several years. The majority of the stores we intend to open in 2017 will be located in existing markets where we will be able to leverage economies of scale in marketing, distribution, and store talent. We also intend to enter at least one new market in 2017. Additionally, we will continue to focus on strategies to further enhance the return on our new store investments by selecting retail spaces that provides us the opportunity to reduce the initial investment to build a new store and, in some cases, the ongoing occupancy costs.    ﻿
 Sales Model
 ﻿
 We principally sell our products directly to homeowners and professionals. With regard to individual customers, we believe that due to the average cost and relative infrequency of a tile purchase, many of our individual customers conduct extensive research using multiple channels before making a purchase decision. Our sales strategy emphasizes customer service by providing comprehensive and convenient educational tools on our website and in our stores for our customers to learn about our products and the tile installation process. Our website contains a broad range of information regarding our tile products, setting and maintenance materials, and accessories. Customers can order samples, view catalogs, or purchase products from either our stores or website. In 2016, we introduced our new Digital Design Studio, a dynamic tool that our customers and sales associates can use to design the layout of a bathroom, kitchen, or other room and make various product selections. Customers can choose to have their purchases delivered or picked up at one of our stores. We believe this strategy also positions us well with professional customers who are influenced by the preferences of individual homeowners.
 ﻿
 Our stores are designed to emphasize our products in a visually appealing showroom format. Our average store is approximately 21,100 square feet, with a majority of the square footage devoted to the showroom and several thousand square feet of warehouse space, which is used primarily to hold customer orders waiting to be picked up or delivered. Our stores are typically accessible from major roadways and have significant visibility to passing traffic. We can adapt to a range of existing buildings; free-standing or in shopping centers.
 ﻿
 Unlike many of our competitors, we devote a substantial portion of our retail store space to showrooms, including samples of our over 4,000 products and up to 50 different vignettes of bathrooms, kitchens, fireplaces, foyers, outdoor living, and other distinct spaces that showcase our products. Our showrooms are designed to provide our customers with a better understanding of how to integrate various types of tile in order to create an attractive presentation in their homes. Many stores are also equipped with a training center designed to teach customers how to properly install tile.
 ﻿
 A typical store staff consists of a manager, an assistant manager, sales associates, and a warehouse leader. Our store managers are responsible for store operations and for overseeing our customers’ shopping experience. We offer financing to customers through a branded credit card provided by a third-party consumer finance company.

Marketing
 ﻿
 We utilize a variety of marketing strategies and programs to acquire and retain customers, including both consumers and trade professionals. Our advertising primarily consists of digital media, direct marketing including email and postal mail, in store events, and mobile and traditional media vehicles, including newspaper circular/print ads, radio, out of home and video. We continually test and learn from new media and adjust our programs based on performance.
 ﻿
 Our e-commerce site, tileshop.com, supports desktop, tablet and mobile devices and is designed for consumers, trade professionals and industry stakeholders to learn about our brand, our value propositions, our product assortment, installation techniques, and to look up our store locations and account information. It hosts our Design Studio, a collaborative platform that enables the creation of customized 3D design renderings to scale, allowing customers to bring their ideas to life. On social media, #TheTileShop provides current and prospective customers a high level of brand engagement and enables customers to share their finished projects in our inspiration gallery. Tileshop.com also serves as a commerce platform for our customers who want to purchase products within or outside of our physical store footprint. Products can be delivered to a job site, home or store location.
 ﻿
 Products
 ﻿
 We offer a complete assortment of tile products, sourced directly from our vendors, including natural stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass, cement, wood look, and metal tiles. Natural stone products include marble, granite, quartz, sandstone, travertine, slate, and onyx tiles. Our wide assortment of trim pieces, mosaics, pencils, listellos and other unique products encourage our customers to make a fashion statement with their tile project. This also helps us to deliver a high level of customer satisfaction and drive repeat business. We also offer a broad range of setting and maintenance materials, such as thinset, grout, sealers, and accessories, including installation tools, shower and bath shelves, drains, and similar products. We sell most of our products under our proprietary brand names, including Superior Adhesives & Chemicals, Superior Tools & Supplies, Rush River, and Fired Earth. In total, we offer over 4,000 different tile products, setting and maintenance materials and accessory products. The percentage of sales by product category were comprised of the following for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

  Manufacturers
 ﻿
 We have long-standing relationships with our vendors throughout the world and work with them to design and manufacture products exclusively for us. We believe that these direct relationships differentiate us from our competitors. 
 ﻿
 We currently purchase tile products from approximately 200 different suppliers. Our top ten tile vendors accounted for 42% of our tile purchases in 2016. Our largest supplier accounted for approximately 12% of our total purchases in 2016. We believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for most of our products. Purchases were made from the following continents for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

 Distribution and Order Fulfillment
 ﻿
 We take possession of our products in the country of origin and arrange for transportation to our distribution centers located in Michigan, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Virginia and Wisconsin. We also manufacture many of our setting and maintenance materials in Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia, and Wisconsin. We maintain a large inventory of products in order to quickly fulfill customer orders. 
 ﻿
 We fulfill customer orders primarily by shipping our products to our stores where customers can either pick them up or arrange for home delivery. Orders placed on our website are shipped directly to customers’ homes from our distribution centers or a local store.

We continue to evaluate logistics alternatives to best serve our retail store base and our customers. We believe that our existing distribution facilities will continue to play an integral role in our growth strategy, and we expect to establish one or more additional distribution centers to support geographic expansion of our retail store base and to support our store growth plans.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The retail tile market is highly-fragmented. We compete directly with large national home centers that offer a wide range of home improvement products. In addition, we also compete with regional and local specialty retailers of tile, factory-direct stores, a large number of privately-owned, single-site stores, and online only competitors. We also compete indirectly with companies that sell other types of floor coverings, including wood floors, carpet, and vinyl. The barriers of entry into the retail tile industry are relatively low and new or existing tile retailers could enter our markets and increase the competition that we face. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied product offerings, and greater financial, technical, and other resources.
 ﻿
 We believe that the key competitive factors in the retail tile industry include:

· | product assortment;
--+--------------------


· | product presentation;
--+----------------------


· | customer service;
--+------------------


· | store location;
--+----------------


· | immediacy of inventory; and
--+----------------------------


· | price.
--+-------

  ﻿
 We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors by providing a highly diverse selection of products to our customers, at an attractive value, in appealing and convenient retail store locations, with exceptional customer service and on-site instructional opportunities. Further, while some larger factory-direct competitors manufacture their own products, many of our competitors purchase their tile from domestic manufacturers or distributors when they receive an order from a customer. We also believe that we offer a broader range of products and stronger in-store customer support than these competitors.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,448 employees, 1,331 of whom were full-time and none of whom were represented by a union. Of these employees, 1,105 work in our stores, 72 work in corporate, store support, infrastructure or similar functions, and 271 work in distribution and manufacturing facilities. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
 ﻿
 Property and Trademarks
 ﻿
 We have registered and unregistered trademarks for all of our brands, including 19 registered trademarks. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value and our brands are an important factor in the marketing of our products. Accordingly, we have taken, and continue to take, appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property.
 ﻿
 Government Regulation
 ﻿
 We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, zoning, and fire codes. We operate each of our stores, offices, and distribution and manufacturing facilities in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws, codes, and regulations.
 ﻿
 Our operations and properties are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, substances and wastes and relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, including off-site disposal locations. We do not incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations. However, we could be subject to material costs, liabilities, or claims relating to environmental compliance in the future, especially in the event of changes in existing laws and regulations or in their interpretation.
 ﻿
 Products that we import into the United States are subject to laws and regulations imposed in conjunction with such importation, including those issued and enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in these areas.
