ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Our Business
 
Altair International Corp. (“Altair”) is a development stage company that was incorporated in Nevada on December 20, 2012.
 
The Company is currently engaged in identifying and assessing new business opportunities. In this regard, the Company entered into a Mining Lease effective August 3, 2020 with Oliver Geoservices LLC under which the Company received an exclusive lease to mine certain unpatented lode mining claims known as the Walker Ridge located in Elko County, Nevada for a period of five years. The lease can be extended for an additional twenty years if certain extension payments are made within the term of the lease. The Company made an initial payment of $25,000 to secure the lease and is required to make advance royalty payments to maintain its exclusivity commencing December 1, 2020, starting at $25,000 and increasing in $25,000 increments each year for the initial five year term to $100,000 as well as a 3% net smelter fee royalty on all mineral production from the leased property. The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement which was filed as Item 1.01 to a Form 8-K filed on August 14, 2020.
 
The Company has completed the staking process of 187 claims on the Walker Ridge site. The claims must be registered with the Nevada Bureau of Land Management. We estimate that the cost to register the claims to be between $40,000 and $50,000. To date, we have not registered the claims. The Company is currently awaiting completion by the United States Forestry Service (the “USFS”) of the calculations for the required Reclamation Bond which is required to begin work on the drill site. We estimate the value of the bond to be between $40,000 and $50,000.

Walker Ridge Property History
 
A large area (boundaries uncertain), located between the Jerritt Canyon and Big Springs properties, including ground covered by the present Walker Ridge Property claims, was explored by Tenneco (subsequently acquired by Echo Bay). From 1985-87, Tenneco/Echo Bay conducted geologic mapping, rock chip and soil geochemistry sampling (3400 samples) and drilled 31 shallow holes (maximum depth 400 ft or 122m), mostly to the southwest of the Walker Ridge Property. There are no useable maps available from this work, only summary reports. One shallow hole drilled within the present claim block (Figure 7.3), hole number FC1-87, intercepted Snow Canyon Fm below McAfee Quartzite at 245 feet (75m). It was anomalous in gold from there to TD at 300 feet (91m).
 
Independence Mining Company optioned the same property from Echo Bay between 1988 and 1993, drilling 6 holes totaling 4,920 feet (1,500m), southwest of the present claims. A deep rotary/core hole reached favorable Carlin-style host lithologies (Roberts Mountain Formation) at 1,495 feet (456m), or approximately 6,000 feet (1,830m) above mean sea level. There are no maps showing this work currently available, only summary reports. Echo Bay was absorbed by Kinross several years ago. It is possible that some of that data may be preserved in the archives of Kinross.
 
In 2007 an infill soil sampling program was carried out by Stratos over the central part of the current claim block to reduce the sample spacing to 200 feet (60m). The Company optioned the property in 2011. At the direction of the Company, Walker Ridge Gold Corp staked additional claims in 2011 and 2012. All claim staking has been paid by the Company and all additional claims have become a part of the option agreement. The Company has carried out gravity and CSAMT geophysical surveys in the fall of 2012.
 
There are no resource estimates, historical or current, and no recorded production from the property.
 
Earn-In Agreement
 On November 23, 2020, the Company entered into an Earn-In Agreement with American Lithium Minerals, Inc. (“AMLM”) under which we agreed to make total payments of $75,000 to AMLM in exchange for a 10% undivided interest in 63 unpatented placer mining claims comprised of approximately 1,260 acres, and 3 unpatented lode mining claims in Nevada. This $75,000 obligation has been fully satisfied by the Company ($30,000 paid 12/8/2020 and $45,000 paid 1/5/2021), resulting in Altair owning a 10% undivided interest in the claims. The Company has the option to increase its ownership interest by an additional 50% by a total payment of $1,300,648 for exploration and development costs as follows: $100,648 within year one for an additional 10/%, $600,000 in year two for an additional 20% and $600,000 in year three for an additional 20% ownership interest. The Earn-In Agreement grants Altair the exclusive right to explore the properties. 
 
License and Royalty Agreement
 On February 10, 2021, the Company entered into a License and Royalty Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp. (“SX”) and St-Georges Metallurgy Corp. (“SXM”) under which Altair has received a perpetual, non-exclusive license from SX of its lithium extraction technology for Altair to develop its lithium bearing prospects in the United States and SXM’s EV battery recycling technology for which Altair has agreed to act as exclusive master agent to promote the licensing and deployment of the EV battery recycling technology in North America. Altair has agreed to provide SX with a net revenue interest royalty on all metals and minerals extracted (the “Products”) and sold from Altair’s mineral interests in the United States and SX has agreed to provide Altair with a 1% trailer fee on any royalty received by SX from the licensing of the SX EV battery recycling technology to each licensee of the SX EV battery recycling technology referred by Altair or Altair’s sub-agents. Altair will pay a royalty of 5% of the net revenue received by Altair for sales of Products using the lithium extraction technology which decreases to 3% of the net revenue on all payments in excess of US$8,000,000 of production on an annualized basis.
