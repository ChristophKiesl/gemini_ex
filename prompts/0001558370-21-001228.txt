ITEM 1:       BUSINESS
Company Overview
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated (“Ritchie Bros.”, the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) (NYSE & TSX: RBA) was founded in 1958 in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada and is a world leader in asset management technologies and disposition of commercial assets, selling $5.41 billion of used equipment and other assets during 2020. Our expertise, unprecedented global reach, market insight, and trusted portfolio of brands provide us with a unique position in the used equipment market. We sell used equipment for our customers through live, unreserved auctions at over 40 auction sites worldwide, which are also simulcast online to reach a global bidding audience and through our online marketplaces.
Through our unreserved auctions, online marketplaces, and private brokerage services, we sell a broad range of used and unused commercial assets, including earthmoving equipment, truck tractors, truck trailers, government surplus, oil and gas equipment and other industrial assets. Construction and heavy machinery comprise the majority of the equipment sold. Customers selling equipment through our sales channels include end users (such as construction companies), equipment dealers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and other equipment owners (such as rental companies). Our customers participate in a variety of sectors, including heavy construction, transportation, agriculture, energy, and mining. 
We also provide our customers with a wide array of other services aligned with our growth strategy to create a global marketplace for used equipment services and solutions. Our other services include equipment financing, asset appraisals and inspections, online equipment listing, logistical services, and ancillary services such as equipment refurbishment. Additionally, we offer our customers asset technology solutions to manage the end to end disposition process of their assets and provide market data intelligence to make more accurate and reliable business decisions.
We operate globally with locations in more than 12 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands, and employ more than 2,600 full-time employees worldwide.
Acquisition of Rouse 
​
On December 8, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Rouse Services LLC (“Rouse”), a privately-held California limited liability company that is a leading provider of data intelligence and performance benchmarking solutions to help customers make better decisions. Rouse provides appraisals to asset backed lenders, market intelligence and software to rental companies, contractors, and dealers to optimize the used equipment sales process, and comparisons of rental rates, utilization, and other key performance metrics to industry benchmarks for rental companies and dealers. We acquired Rouse for $275 million. After adjustments for indebtedness, net working capital and closing items, we paid cash of $250.3 million and issued 312,913 common shares valued at approximately $22 million. Of the fair value of the common shares issued, $1.5 million was part of the purchase price, and $20.7 million is owed to certain continuing employees subject to their continuing employment through various vesting dates up to three years from the acquisition date. As a result, the total purchase price of Rouse was $251.7 million, comprised of $250.3 million in cash and $1.5 million in equity consideration.
​
The acquisition of Rouse is aligned with our accelerated growth efforts and with our strategy of becoming the trusted global marketplace for insights, services and transaction solutions for commercial assets. Rouse will enhance the data analytics and service offerings available to our customers by providing them with more robust data, better service, and innovative solutions to help their businesses run more efficiently. Beyond data and analytics, Rouse also offers highly rated equipment sales support and fleet appraisals. Rouse will continue to maintain its physical presence in Los Angeles, United States for the foreseeable future. 
​
Impact of COVID-19 to our Business 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant global economic disruption and has materially impacted several countries and regions in which we operate, including the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. It has resulted in travel restrictions, economic uncertainty, and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and has negatively disrupted global manufacturing and workforce participation, including our own.

In 2020, our ability to move equipment to and from our auction sites, foremost in Asia and Europe, was negatively impacted as regional governments issued orders requiring persons who were not engaged in essential activity to remain at home or ordering non-essential businesses to close in response to the pandemic to limit the spread of infections. Our European region experienced some constraints by the cross-border quarantine requirements making equipment transport challenging and consequently impacting our overall auction volumes during the year. Certain other regions throughout the year, including our North America region, went into and subsequently lifted lockdown policies impacting our businesses, however unlike Europe and Asia, the dependency to move equipment across country borders within Canada and the US was not as large a factor in our ability to operate our businesses. 
Our top priority regarding the COVID-19 pandemic remains the health and welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers and others with whom we partner to run our business activities. We are strictly enforcing all local government and jurisdictional safety guidelines, and, in some instances, we are applying additional over-and-above safety measures. In the first quarter of 2020, we implemented our business continuity plans and instructed employees at many of our offices across the globe (including our corporate headquarters) to work from home on a temporary basis and implemented travel restrictions. These work-from-home orders and travel restrictions continued to be observed and were enforced throughout the year. 
In 2020, we were able to operate and serve our customers’ equipment and immediate liquidity needs through our platform of auction technology solutions and online auction capabilities. In addition to running our IronPlanet weekly featured online auction, our online Marketplace-E solution and our GovPlanet online auctions, we modified our live operations in March 2020 to transition all of our traditional live on site industrial auctions to online bidding. Buyers are still able to visit our live auction sites in advance of the virtual auctions to conduct inspections and pick up equipment post auction, but we are no longer holding live auction events in our theatres. We are enforcing rigid guidelines for equipment drop off, buyer inspections and post auction pickup of equipment to ensure the highest regard for the safety of our employees and customers. In addition, in 2020 we implemented Time Auctioned Lots (TAL) solution for selected events. 
We have actively taken steps to be prudent on expenses and other cash outflows during the year, while taking steps to maximize our positive cash flows while still investing for future growth. Our priority is to support our employees, and we are actively monitoring the situation and changing dynamics in each of our respective regions and adjusting our operations as necessary. To this date, layoffs or furlough activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been limited in scope. As at the end of the year, after completing the acquisition of Rouse on December 8, 2020 with $250.3 million of cash consideration, we held a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity position. As of December 31, 2020, we have $278.8 million of unrestricted cash and $455.1 million of unused committed capacity under our long term revolving credit facilities. On August 14, 2020 we successfully amended and extended our credit facilities totaling US$630.0 million to expire in October 2023. We have also developed comprehensive contingency plans should the COVID-19 pandemic have a prolonged adverse impact on our business impeding our ability to generate revenue. 
The extent of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, time of mass vaccine distribution, and any related restrictions placed by respective global governments, as well as supply and demand impacts driven by our consignor and buyer base, all of which are uncertain and cannot be easily predicted. Although at the time of this filing, we continue to operate our modified live site operations in all regions, there is no assurance that our operations could not be impacted in the future. 
We are actively monitoring the impact COVID-19 is having in the world and remain ready to take additional actions based on any new governmental guidance or recommendations. We continue to review and assess the pandemic’s impacts on our customers, our suppliers and our business so that we can address the effect on our business and service our customers. It is unknown how long the pandemic will last, how many people are ultimately going to be affected by it, and the long-term implications to local or global economies. Equally, it is still not easily discernable to understand the real effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on equipment supply, buyer demand, and potential pricing volatility, or the potential impact on our buyers’ ability to pay or secure financing. Additionally, there is a level of uncertainty over the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our third party vendors, partners and the service providers with whom we currently do business with today. Their ability to partner with us may be temporarily or permanently constrained and for some, the business terms under which they continue to partner with us could change as they manage their business through these unprecedented times. As such, given the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future impacts on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, financial performance or our ability to pay dividends.

Strategy 
In August 2020 we formalized a new strategy to address the large and fragmented used equipment marketplace that we operate in today. We believe our new strategy will help us unlock significant growth opportunities by building on Ritchie Bros.’ core business and expanding into additional services. We offer a wide range of sales channels and formats to our customers providing unprecedented choice including live auction, online simulcast auction, featured online auctions, marketplaces as well as private contract negotiations. We are building on our position as a trusted advisor to our customers by evolving from transactional selling to meeting the needs of our customers through solution selling.
We see significant growth opportunities ahead by becoming the trusted global marketplace for insights, services, and transaction solutions for commercial assets. This represents not a shift, but an expansion of our former vision and the transaction solutions for which we are already well known. We value our long-tenured relationships with our customers, and the trust they have in our brand and platform. We are leveraging our sales channels to create a global marketplace for services and solutions that help our customers gain the insights they need to make decisions and run their businesses. We also intend to offer complimentary third party services on our platform where it will help our customers.
This strategy is supported by five strategic pillars on which we will build our future success:

Customer Experience - At Ritchie Bros., we have a long history, culture and passion for helping our customers. We continue to find ways to enrich our customers’ experience by making our processes easier, our offerings more complete and our brands simpler.
Employee Experience - We cannot deliver a great customer experience without great employees. We continue to strive to create the best workplace for all employees and to create a place where they want to build a career. We encourage open and honest dialogue and are committed to robust communications from management to employees and creating channels for them to give feedback, as well as fixing processes and technology to improve the work environment for the benefit of both customers and employees.
Modern Architecture - We are transitioning to a modern architecture based in the cloud and comprised of microservices that allow us to create a single presence for our customers across all of our solutions. A modern architecture will allow flexibility and agility to enable scalable growth for us, our customers, and our partners. 

​

​



Inventory Management System - We see our Inventory Management System, which integrates and tracks inventory data for selected customers, as a gateway for our customers to access our marketplaces and services. With the data, we can offer more timely and proactive advice and solutions to our customers with more ease of use.
Accelerate growth – We continually seek to identify areas to pilot improved business processes to positively impact the customer experience. We look to accelerate growth by scaling the learnings from these pilots into our global operations.
We believe our new strategy of becoming the global trusted marketplace for commercial assets will allow us to better serve our customers and will facilitate better penetration into non-auction markets and associated services. Building an integrated, easy to use marketplace, and becoming the trusted advisor to our customers opens significant potential for our business. We will start, as always, with our customers and our partners, and make sure we are building what they need.
Service Offerings
We offer our equipment buyer and seller customers multiple distinct, complementary, multi-channel brand solutions that address the range of their needs. Our global customer base has a variety of transaction options, breadth of services, and the widest selection of used equipment available to them.

Intellectual Property
We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in marketing our organization, services, and website, as well as differentiating us from our competitors. We own or hold the rights to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks, domain names and tradenames. We protect our intellectual property in Canada, the U.S., and internationally through federal, provincial, state, and common law rights, including registration of certain trademark and service marks for many of our brands, including our core brands. We also have secured patents for inventions and have registered our domain names.
​

​



We rely on contractual restrictions and rights to protect certain of our proprietary rights in products and services. Effective protection of our intellectual property can be expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in many jurisdictions throughout the world. In addition, we may, from time to time, be subject to intellectual property claims, including allegations of infringement, which can be costly to defend. For a discussion of the risks involved with intellectual property litigation and enforcement of our intellectual property rights, see the related information in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Competition
Competition Overview
The global used equipment market is highly fragmented with total annual global used equipment volumes estimated at more than $300 billion. We estimate the used equipment auction segment is $30 billion. Ritchie Bros. is the largest live auction company and claims approximately 20% market share of the live auction space with its $5.4 billion in GTV volume in 2020. We compete based on breadth, brand reputation, security, technology, and global reach of our services, as well as in the variety of contracts and methods and channels of selling equipment. In addition to the auction segment, two other major segments include private sales and brokers as well as the retail segment which includes OEM’s, OEM dealers, rental companies and large strategic accounts. We also compete with private sales – often securing new business from equipment owners who had previously tried selling their equipment privately. Given the fragmentation in the auction market as well as upstream opportunities in private sales and retail, there is significant opportunity for growth.
Competitive advantages
Our key strengths provide distinct competitive advantages and have enabled us to achieve significant and profitable growth over the long term.
Global platform
We pride ourselves on our ability to connect buyers and sellers through our global network of over 40 auction sites in 12 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands and via multiple online sales channels. Our online bidding technology and Ritchie Bros. website are currently available in 10 and 22 languages, respectively. Our global presence ensures we generate global market pricing for our equipment sellers, as we reach international buyers and equipment demand, helping to deliver strong price realization. This global reach provides us and our selling customers with the ability to transcend local market conditions and provides buyers visibility into equipment availability all over the world.
Customer Relationships
Relationships are the core of Ritchie Bros. – delighting customers and treating them like friends while meeting their business needs. By offering an unprecedented choice of solutions that best suit our customers’ needs, making their lives easier in the process, we develop relationships that can last across generations. We take a long-term approach with our customers and as such we position our sales force to act as trusted advisors to our customers.
Breadth of solutions
The acquisition of IronPlanet in 2017 provided us with the ability to meet all the buyers’ and sellers’ unique needs in a one-stop-shop manner. The event-driven live on site auction, which has been Ritchie Bros.’ core business for nearly 60 years, is now just one—albeit powerful solution—to meet our customers’ varied needs. By delivering choice, we can work with customers as a trusted advisor to provide them each with a tailored suite of equipment disposition solutions and asset management capabilities to best meet their needs.
While Ritchie Bros. has a full suite of solutions, most of its transactions are enabled through three core solutions:

1. | The unreserved on site auction which provides Ritchie Bros. customers with care, custody, and control at its live auction sites.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | IronPlanet weekly online auctions for sellers looking to manage the disposition of their assets on a more frequent basis and being able to sell from their yard or location without having to move equipment. Auctions are held every Thursday in North America; monthly in our international regions.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Marketplace-E is the reserved online marketplace that affords sellers with control over price and timing, and with solutions such as Make Offer, Buy Now, and Reserve Price selling formats for buyers.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition to transaction solutions, Ritchie Bros. offers a variety of services related to owning, maintaining and transacting equipment, including inspections, appraisals, transportations, refurbishment and more.

​



Delivering Insights and Services through Data & Analytics
​
A core part of the Ritchie Bros.’ strategy is delivering insights and services through rich data and analytics. Based on the world’s largest used equipment transaction dataset, we provide data products that allow customers to analyze market dynamics and value assets – these tools include Ritchie Bros. Market Trends and Ritchie Bros. Asset Valuator.
We continue to invest in Data Science to deliver asset value predictions, generate user leads, prioritize marketing investments, interpret price trends and more. Proprietary algorithmic asset pricing is used internally to set target values and optimize marketplace operations and externally to provide users of Ritchie Bros. Asset Solutions with instant asset values on inventory. The monthly Ritchie Bros. Used Equipment Market Trends Summary report features our proprietary use of Machine Learning to provide Mix-Adjusted Price Indexes for core asset groups around the globe. Correlated with other leading economic indicators, these price indexes have been quickly adopted by customers, analysts, and manufacturers as a key insight into pricing trends. Machine Learning also supports important strategic and operational decisions such as site expansion, testing marketplace performance, and experimentation with improved formats.
The acquisition of Rouse greatly expands our data and service offerings. Rouse Appraisals, Rouse Sales and Rouse Analytics are leaders in providing benchmarking and valuation services to lenders, rental companies, contractors and dealers. Rouse’s business model is built upon an extensive data ecosystem, proprietary analytics and Data Science techniques, and trusted customer relationships rooted in service and confidentiality.
Our People 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 2,600 full-time employees (up 7.6% from 2019) and 2,500 part time employees worldwide, representing approximately 51% and 49%, respectively, of our global workforce. We also periodically hire contractors as needed to support our auctions, various businesses, and other projects. 
Of our total full-time employees, 867 people work locally in the field to support our global auction operations and 425 people are focused on sales. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created a need for us to transition all of our auctions on-line, and as a result we quickly adjusted our procedures to secure the safety of our employees and customers without layoffs and with minor furloughs in one of our business units.
In support of our new growth strategy, we restructured our customer care teams during the third quarter of 2020 to better align ourselves with our customers’ experience. We created a new customer care hub in Fort Worth, Texas which resulted in a better alignment of our resources to our customers and provides our customers support before, during and post sales. This alignment provided new opportunities for our teams in both Burnaby, Canada and Fort Worth, United States. In December 2020, with the acquisition of Rouse, we also welcomed 51 new full-time employees.
As part of our five strategic pillars to Deliver the Best Employee Experience, we are focused on creating moments that matter as the framework of our employee experience, including: My first impression (candidate experience); My Rewards (benefits and recognition); My Development (new opportunities and skill building); My Leader (leader development and regular performance conversations); My Life Moments (work anniversaries and life events); and My Making a Difference (community giving, volunteering, and my voice). Combined, these moments create each employees’ Ritchie Bros. story―#MyRBStory. During 2021 we will continue to assess satisfaction regarding the current state of our programs to support our journey of developing more employee-centric experiences for our people. We will measure our effectiveness over delivering the best employee experience through pulse-check surveys and review of employee responses to our changes and approach. 
Development and Engagement
Our objective is to develop and engage our people. We invest in a variety of training, development and engagement practices as well as programs such as Personal Effectiveness, Transition to Leadership and Coaching for Success. We conduct pulse surveys and host monthly town-hall meetings to connect with our people. Overall, we measure our success in these areas through review of annual turnover rates, review of career progressions, and magnitude of internal promotions. 
​
We provide all our employees access to a library of online learning, videos, books, and resources to help support ongoing personal and professional development. There are over 3000+ courses that range in subject matter from communication and time management skills, to resolving conflict and building effective teams. In total, during 2020 we have invested $1.7 million in training and development programs. As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, we also curated tools and resources and developed training programs 

​

​



to help our employees successfully transition to working remotely and provide them with the skills to manage the challenges in these uncertain times. We checked in with our employees through pulse surveys and communicated through distribution of a twice-weekly newsletter named #RitchieStrong. Our newsletter, which comes directly from our CEO to all of our employees, promotes our successes, highlights our people and encourages social distancing and safety practices. Each newsletter ends with a reminder that employees can raise comments and ask questions directly to our CEO via email. 
​
We continue to monitor our management-to-employee ratio, seeking to identify the most optimal structure for our business. In 2020, we began efforts to achieve an 8:1 regional sales manager to territory manager ratio to standardize the ratio across North America. This ratio and model is designed to expand the time spent by leaders in our business to coach our people and allow the regional sales managers to better assess the readiness and support the territory managers need to develop. 
​
During 2020, we held conversations with our employees twice a year to evaluate their performance and development. Going forward in 2021, we will shift to quarterly performance conversations to drive performance and engagement. To measure the success of our people development and engagement, we conducted a pulse survey check mid-year, which identified that the 41% of our employees who responded communicated 95% satisfaction that the conversations recognized their accomplishments, clarified their priorities for the year, reinforced the Ritchie Bros. values, and adequately addressed their development plans.
​
Health & Safety
Our objective is to keep our people healthy and safe – to send everyone home, every day, the way they came to work.
​
All new employees are required to complete a safety orientation training that captures our health and safety programs, our policy statement and provides an overview of our global Employee Health and Safety (“EHS”) policies and expectations. Our 2020 completion rate for the safety orientation program was 97.4%.
​
We also have a risk management process to support our safety orientation programs and our health and safety commitment which ensures that our employees are exposed to the lowest possible level of risk. Our risk management process begins with an annual review of all incidents from the prior year to identify trends to see if we need to address findings through changes in our policies and procedures. 
Daily, our employees conduct either a field level hazard assessment or complete a risk identification card to identify risks relating to the performance of their roles. These risk identification cards are monitored by our yard managers and/or our regional operations managers and corrective actions are taken to ensure that the risk is reduced or eliminated. During 2020 we had over 10,000 risk identification cards completed by our staff.
We also conduct annual online safety training with employees who perform certain operational tasks. In 2020 our completion rate for this training was over 98%. Additionally, in 2020 managers at our sites were also required to complete a series of online courses as part of their professional development. In 2020 we had a completion rate of over 95%.
​
We also measure our Total Recordable Injury Rate (“TRIR”) which measures the number of reportable incidences per 100 full-time workers during the year. Our annual TRIR goal is to meet or do better than the industrial average. Further, to assist us in our safety journey we periodically engage the services of a third-party consultant to conduct a safety perception survey.  

Every region within our organization also has a Safety Steering team that provides feedback on our safety journey and assists in identifying issues or concerns that may arise. Our success in health and safety relies on everyone taking an active role in the development and implementation of our programs, participating in training and providing feedback on our progress in our safety journey.
​
Diversity & Inclusion 
Our objective is to foster a workplace culture that actively and consistently values diversity and inclusion. Specifically, we want our teams to understand the strength of diversity, the power that comes from an inclusive environment and the effect it can have on our teams, businesses and stakeholders.
​
The focus of our diversity and inclusion journey began with a focus on gender diversity. Female representation at our most senior executive leadership level is at 31%, which is the highest mix in the Company’s history. At the Board of Directors level, we have more than doubled our female representation at 45% as of August 2020.
​

​

Ritchie Bros. | 10

​



Our first employee resource group (“ERG”), Women’s LINK, also focuses on gender diversity. It was launched in 2018 and membership has nearly tripled today to 190 volunteers. Although this ERG’s primary goal is to support our women, the broader mandate is to make the resources and services available to all of our employees. 
​
In 2020, we continued our journey by stating very clearly that Black Lives Matter at Ritchie Bros. We invited employees worldwide to participate in roundtable discussions about bias, racism and how we can make our doors more open to people of color. With more than 100 employee volunteers representing 5 countries, 3 provinces and 14 states, we formed a Black Lives Matter ERG. Based on employee interest, we are now creating a framework to support additional ERGs that meet our employees’ diverse needs. 
​
Productivity
Our objective is to hire and retain employees that help generate revenues. The majority of our revenue continues to be generated by our A&M segment operations. Sales force productivity within this segment is an operational statistic that we believe provides a gauge of the effectiveness of our revenue producers in increasing GTV. Revenue producers is a term used to describe our revenue-producing sales personnel which includes regional sales managers and territory managers.
​
Ethical Conduct
Our success and reputation are founded upon our commitment to honesty, integrity, and doing what is right—each element highlighted under our value of Integrity. Our objective is to monitor and facilitate reporting of unethical conduct. We do this by maintaining a confidential and anonymous independent third-party telephone line and web access hotline for anyone to submit concerns regarding potential code violations or other ethics-related matters without fear of repercussions. All reported matters are investigated fully and reported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
​
The Role of Technology
Implementing a modern architecture on which we can scale and grow profitably is a core strategic pillar for Ritchie Bros. The role of technology in our business continues to evolve and become more meaningful as buyers adopt mobile and online channels to transact their business with us while sellers further utilize our inventory management system. We continue to invest in technology to further transition to a modern cloud-based architecture driven by microservices that allows for agility, flexibility and scalability of our solutions.
We remain focused on technology enablement to transform the way we compete, the way we work and the way we leverage technology to drive future growth. Our technology capabilities are delivering choices for our customers in the form of multiple channels for buyers and sellers, meeting customer’s asset management needs through information-rich software solutions and leveraging our rich data repository to drive strong sales and improved pricing decisions. We are also providing our customers with leading tools and capabilities to deliver full life-cycle asset management for used equipment.
Data Privacy and Security
As the role of technology and data in our business expands, so too does the importance of cybersecurity. We take protecting our customers, employees, brand, systems and data very seriously. We actively monitor and manage security risks and looks to mitigate them through enterprise-wide programs, employee training and vulnerability assessments. We have made – and continue to make – investments in dedicated information security resources, leadership and technology. We continue to strengthen and enhance our programs and controls around people, process and technology and apply risk-based strategies to enhance detection, protection and response efforts.
Our commitment to data security and privacy is demonstrated in our overall approach to governance. We are incorporating security and privacy by design and increasing awareness around the company with support from management and our board, which include:

● | We have formed a Data Privacy Committee. The oversight of the committee is to develop and approve our general strategy and policies on data privacy and data protection, assess the data privacy risks associated with our business activities, and provide direction to, and support the initiatives of, our Data Privacy Office.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Information Security and Policy committee meets on a monthly basis and advises on technology and legal and internal audit issues relating to security and risk reduction. This committee is responsible for reviewing and setting security policies, assessing risk and impacts of security incidents, and providing guidance and direction for security programs and strategy. The committee will be advised regarding information security assessment activities and will provide advice regarding education and communication that may be needed to support the information security policies and other compliance policy.

● | All eligible employees complete mandatory privacy and information-security training courses, which are refreshed annually. Through continual awareness-building, such as our Cybersecurity Awareness Month every October, we work to promote a culture that understands the critical importance of data security and privacy, areas of vulnerability and how to remain vigilant when handling data.

Seasonality
Our GTV and associated A&M segment revenues are affected by the seasonal nature of our business. GTV and A&M segment revenues tend to increase during the second and fourth calendar quarters, during which time we generally conduct more business than in the first and third calendar quarters. Given the operating leverage inherent in our business model, the second and fourth quarter also tend to produce higher operating margins, given the higher volume and revenue generated in those quarters.
The restrictions imposed and effects of the overall economic environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact these trends.
Revenue Mix Fluctuations
Our revenue is comprised of service revenue and inventory sales revenue. Service revenue from A&M segment activities include commissions earned at our live auctions, online marketplaces, and private brokerage services, and various auction-related fees, including listing and buyer transaction fees. We also recognize revenues from our Other Services activities as service revenue. Inventory sales revenue is recognized as part of our A&M activities and relates to revenues earned through our inventory contracts.
Inventory sales revenue can fluctuate significantly, as it changes based on whether our customers sell using a straight or guarantee commission contract, or an inventory contract at time of selling. Straight or guarantee commission contracts will result in the commission being recognized as service revenue, while inventory contracts will result in the gross transaction value of the equipment sold being recorded as inventory sales revenue with the related cost recognized in cost of inventory sold. As a result, a change in the revenue mix between service revenues and revenue from inventory sales can have a significant impact on revenue growth percentages.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Laws
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules, and regulations throughout the world. We believe that we are compliant in all material respects with those laws, rules, and regulations that affect our business, and that such compliance does not impose a material impediment on our ability to conduct our business.
We believe that, among other things, laws, rules, and regulations related to the following list of items affect our business:

● | Imports and exports of equipment. Particularly, there are restrictions in the U.S. and Europe that may affect the ability of equipment owners to transport certain equipment between specified jurisdictions. Also, engine emission standards in some jurisdictions limit the operation of certain trucks and equipment in those regions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development or expansion of auction sites. Such activities depend upon the receipt of required licenses, permits, and other governmental authorizations. We are also subject to various local zoning requirements pertaining to the location of our auction sites, which vary among jurisdictions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The use, storage, discharge, and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Under such laws, an owner or lessee of, or other person involved in, real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee or other person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Worker health and safety, privacy of customer information, and the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials.
