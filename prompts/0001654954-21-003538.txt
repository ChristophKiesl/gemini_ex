  Business Overview
  
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 60 full-time employees. We possess certifications with our business and technology partners and our personnel maintain numerous security and technical certifications and qualifications. Our professionals are located at our headquarters in Pittsford, New York and in the states of Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington.
  
 We had sales of approximately $7.2 million in 2020 and approximately $7.1 million in 2019. We generated operating income of approximately $1,000 in 2020 as compared to approximately $329,000 in 2019. We had net income of approximately $673,000 in 2020 and approximately $48,000 in 2019. We recorded other income of approximately $967,000 in 2020 primarily from the forgiveness of our Payroll Protection Plan loan. We derived approximately 65% of our sales in 2020 and 70% in 2019 from contracts as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor.
  
 During 2020, we derived approximately 61% of our sales from one prime contractor, Perspecta (spun off from DXC Technology Company in 2018), including sales under subcontracts for services to its end clients, principally a major establishment of the U.S. Government (the U.S. Government Entity) for which we manage information security in one of the nation’s largest physical and virtual environments involving server and application security for the Microsoft Windows environment. During 2019, the percentage was approximately 63%. We have been providing this service to the U.S. Government Entity under a long-standing subcontract, which has been renewed annually since 2004. Our 24x7 team of experts supports approximately 5,000 physical and virtual servers and 250,000 client workstations from facilities in Maryland and Colorado. Operating 24 hours per day and seven days per week, we consistently meet or exceed the requirements of our service level agreements. We refer to this as our Advanced Server Management (ASM) team.
  
 We continued to grow our team of cybersecurity sales and technical consultants as a result of growing demand and accelerated sales growth in this segment of the market. This market segment of cybersecurity accounts for over 20% of our sales as a result of our direct and channel sales mix. We continue to drive development of our cybersecurity business through growing and developing channel marketing, programs, and relationships for Nodeware and cybersecurity consulting. We believe our channel presence through entities including large distribution and master agents have created significant opportunities in both of these areas. This has further reinforced our commitment to this business strategy and our decision to leverage third party channels to bring new business and customers and drive growth of our existing relationships to IGI resulting in improved operating income.
  
 We provide subcontracted professional services to a select set of OEMs and commercial entities that need additional skilled resources when architecting and implementing solutions. We provide cloud computing solutions that include public and private cloud architectures along with hybrid scalable cloud hosting, server virtualization and desktop virtualization solutions. Our experience with cloud and virtualization computing related software has enabled us to take advantage of a growing trend towards Managed IT Security Services, particularly in the SME space. Sales to our principal client, VMware, Inc., consisted of sales under subcontracts for services to their end clients. During 2020, we provided professional services to these clients and earned 3.5% of our sales.

  Business Strategy
  
  Our strategy creates differentiation in cybersecurity by combining personalized and recurring professional services to small to mid-sized enterprises who lack the internal resources to focus on cybersecurity related matters. Additionally, we have built growth businesses by designing, developing, and marketing cybersecurity-based software-as-a-service (SaaS). Products and solutions are spun off from our technology platform to fill technology gaps in cybersecurity. We brought a product platform to market that has two patents pending and intend to develop other intellectual property that serve as the core to other proprietary products and solutions to market through a channel of domestic and international partners and distributors. Our products, solutions, and services are designed to simplify the security needs in customer and partner environments, with a focus on the mid-tier Enterprise market and below. We enable our partners by providing recurring revenue-based business models for both recurring services and through our automated and continuous security solutions. Products may be sold as standalone solutions or integrated into existing environments to further automate the management of security and related IT functions. Our ability to succeed depends on how successful we are in differentiating ourselves in the market at a time when competition and consolidation in these markets is on the rise.
  
 Our cybersecurity business is comprised of three components: cybersecurity services, product development and deployment, and integration of third-party security solutions into our security offerings to our channel and customers. We provide cybersecurity services and technical consulting resources to support both our channel partners and end customers. For example, we sell our proprietary product, Nodeware, through both our direct partners and through other 3rd party partner distribution and agents so they can either sell it as a standalone solution or part of other technical services they provide to their customers. This enables the channel partner to develop a base of recurring revenue. We have also enabled Nodeware to be vertically integrated into other cybersecurity platforms to create native offerings. We also provide our cybersecurity services through our channel partners as a cybersecurity overlay to the technical services they provide, which also provides recurring revenue.
  
 We are working to expand our managed services business with our prime partner, Perspecta, and the current federal enterprise customer and its customers.
  
 The following sections define specific components of our business strategy.
  
 
  Nodeware®
  
 In May 2016, we filed a provisional patent application for our proprietary product, Nodeware and launched it commercially in November 2016. In May 2017, we filed a utility patent application for Nodeware. Our patent application is ready for examination by the U.S. patent application examiner and in 2018, we have provided our first defense of the patent application from the examiner. Nodeware is an automated asset identification and vulnerability management and monitoring solution that enhances security by proactively identifying, monitoring, and addressing potential vulnerabilities on both internal and external facing networks, creating a safeguard against malicious intent to exploit known problems in a customer’s network with simplicity and affordability. Nodeware assesses vulnerabilities in a computer network using scanning technology to capture a comprehensive view of the security exposure of a network infrastructure. Users receive alerts and view network information through a proprietary, web enabled dashboard. Continuous and automated internal scanning and external on demand scanning are components of this offering.
  
 The SaaS based platform has an agile and continuous development process that is flexible to react to customer and market needs. In December 2019, we filed a second provisional patent application and in December 2020 we filed the subsequent action on the institutional patent on the Nodeware platform. In 2020, we created many new feature updates and improvements to the platform in response to COVID-19 needs and impact such as a downloadable Windows executable version along with a Windows Agent that could be downloaded to a remote PC or server. A number of enhancements related to data management, threat intelligence, and user functionality were part of the 2020 continued evolution.
  
 Nodeware creates an opportunity for resellers, including managed service providers, managed security service providers, distributors, and value-added resellers to use a product that provides greater visibility into the network security of an organization. We sell Nodeware in the commercial sector through channel partners and agents. In 2019 and 2020, we continued to expand our channel of directresellers in addition to organizations like Telarus, SYNNEX and Staples.
  
 
  Intellectual Property
  
 We believe that our intellectual property is an asset that may contribute to the growth and profitability of our business. We rely on a combination of patent-pending and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad. To date, we have filed one patent application for our proprietary product, Nodeware, in May 2017 and the second in December 2020 on the platform. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective.
  
 The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability. Our patent application for Nodeware is ready for examination by the U.S. patent application examiner. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, our Nodeware patent was reviewed by an auditor and we continue to defend and address references to the patent to continue its cycle through the process. We are awaiting on an auditor assignment for the second provisional patent filed.
  
 
  Technology and Product Development
  
 Our goal is to position our products and solutions to enable vertical and other API-based integration with other solutions. We have a technology and product development strategy aligned with our business strategy. We continue to identify other technical partners in the cybersecurity market to integrate Nodeware into; through either API or full stack integration.
 Cybersecurity Services
  
 We provide cybersecurity consulting services that include incident response, security awareness training, risk management, IT governance and compliance, security assessment services, penetration testing, and virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) offerings to channel partners and direct customers across different vertical markets (banking, supply chain, manufacturing, legal, etc.) in North America. Our cybersecurity projects leverage different technology platforms and processes such as Nodeware to create a living document that a customer can use to go forward on a path of continuous improvement for its overall IT security. We support both internal and external IT organizations with our cybersecurity overlay that allows us to stay agnostic in the process, especially for compliance while enabling the IT organization to address the issues discovered. We validate overall network security with the goal of maintaining the integrity of confidential client information, preserving the continuity of services, and minimizing potential data damage from attempted threats and incidents. We continue to enhance our Cybersecurity services when opportunities materialize and as the market evolves.
 Partner Agreements
  
  Telarus Master Agent Agreement
  
  SYNNEX distribution agreement. In 2019, we signed a distribution agreement with SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE: SNX), a leading business process services company, to bring Nodeware and IGI’s full suite of cybersecurity services to the SYNNEX reseller channel in the U.S. and Canada. SYNNEX resellers offer IGI services and Nodeware to their customer base, helping them to improve their security posture and reduce their cyber risk.
  
  Staples to sell Nodeware. In 2019, we also signed a distribution agreement with Staples Inc. to sell its Nodeware™ vulnerability management solution through the Staples Business to Business(“B2B”) solutions division. The entire Staples customer base will now have access to this solution.
  
  Staples to sell Cybersecurity services. In 2020, we added our portfolio of cybersecurity services to the distribution agreement with Staples Inc. through the Staples B2B solutions division.
  
  Certifications
  
 Our technical support personnel maintain leading edge certifications and qualifications in the respective software applications. These certifications are examples of our concerted effort to grow and expand our virtualization practice. We believe that our virtualization experience and expertise with VMware will offer opportunities to increase sales, particularly in the cloud computing market.
  
  CISSP® - Certified Information Systems Security Professionals. The CISSP certification is a credential for those with technical and managerial competence, skills, experience, and credibility to design, engineer, implement, and manage overall information security programs to protect organizations from increasingly sophisticated attacks. It is a globally recognized standard of achievement. Certain of our employees in our cyber security group have this certification.
  
  GCIH - GIAC Certified Incident Handler. The GCIH certification is a credential for incident handlers who manage security incidents by understanding common attack techniques, vectors and tools as well as defending against and/or responding to such attacks when they occur. The GCIH certification focuses on detecting, responding, and resolving computer security incidents including:
    ●
 the incident reporting process;

   ●
 malicious applications and network activity;

   ●
 common attack techniques that compromise hosts;

   ●
 system and network vulnerabilities; and

   ●
 continuous process improvement and the root causes of incidents.

 Certain of our employees in our cyber security group have this certification.
  
  CEH – Certified Ethical Hacker. The Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) program is a comprehensive ethical hacking certification to help information security professionals grasp the fundamentals of ethical hacking. The certification serves to assist our consultants to systematically attempt to inspect network infrastructures with the consent of its owner to find security vulnerabilities which a malicious hacker could potentially exploit. The course helps assess the security posture of an organization by identifying vulnerabilities in the network and system infrastructure to determine if unauthorized access is possible. Certain of our employees in our cyber security group have this certification.
  
  Microsoft Gold Certified Partner. We are part of Microsoft's Accredited Online Cloud Services program. We have been certified in sales, pricing and technical delivery of Office 365 which combines the familiar Office desktop suite with cloud-based versions of the next-generation communications and collaboration services: Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and Lync Online. These services are providing real world benefits to our clients while allowing us to offer clear guidelines for transitioning new users to hybrid-cloud-based solutions. We received certification for Windows Intune which provides complete remote desktop support capabilities enhancing our overall goal of providing complete solutions for virtualization and cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS). What once required expensive hardware and time-consuming deployments can now be delivered seamlessly, including web conferencing, collaboration, document management, messaging, customer relationship management and productive office web applications all with lower total cost of ownership and quicker return on investment. We believe our Microsoft competencies assist our business development personnel when presenting solutions that, if accepted, will increase our sales.

  Perspecta Inc. Global Procurement Master Terms Agreement. We are a member of a select group of suppliers that enables Perspecta Inc. (spun off from DXC Technology Company in 2018) to purchase products and services from us under a global procurement master agreement and as specified in a statement of work for each project. This relationship continues to evolve and is something that is responsible for our long-term relationship with the Federal customer mentioned previously. Perspecta has many tools and resources to help us generate new sales streams, and improve our mutual profitability, while at the same time adding unique value for our joint clients. The program comprises practical tools and services that we anticipate will help us in the key areas of marketing and selling our solutions, optimizing the technology, and collaborating with other organizations within our industry to generate more revenue. Our global procurement master agreement with Perspecta runs to January 2021.
  
  Competition
  
 As we increase our focus in cybersecurity services and product development, we face competition from several different vendors in this evolving market. We compete with other IT professional services firms, Managed Security Services Providers (MSSPs), and cybersecurity product and software developers operating in the Federal Government, state and local government and commercial marketplace. We obtain a portion of our business based on proposals submitted in response to requests from potential and current clients, who typically also receive proposals from other firms. We face competition in the commercial markets from other IT service providers, MSSPs, and software development companies, large and small. Many of our larger competitors, in general, have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, sales, and marketing resources, facilities, and experience.
