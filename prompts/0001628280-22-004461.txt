Overview
Velodyne is a global leader in lidar technology providing real-time 3D vision for autonomous systems. Our lidar-based smart vision solutions are advancing the development of safe automated systems throughout the world, empowering the autonomous revolution by allowing machines to see their surroundings. Our solutions are deployed in many applications, including autonomous mobile robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”)/drones, last-mile delivery, precision agriculture, advanced security systems, and smart city initiatives, as well as for automotive applications. In automotive applications, our products improve roadway safety by providing perception data for reliable object avoidance and safe path-planning. To improve roadway, bicycle, and pedestrian safety, we sell automotive solutions to the expanding Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (“ADAS”) market, which will incrementally address the requirements of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) 5-Star Safety Ratings System. In the past, purchases of our solutions in these markets have been primarily focused on research and development projects. We are now seeing growth within this sector of the industry as many of our non-automotive customers move into commercial production with their offerings.
Through our direct sales team as well as through distributors, we sell to both automotive customers, including top automotive OEMs, system integrators, and last-mile delivery providers, as well as to non-automotive customers, who are providing an array of applications, including industrial, drone, and security applications. 
We believe that our lidar technologies can significantly reduce the number of lives lost in vehicle crashes and substantially reduce pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities. Beyond the automotive industry, our technology can also help reduce injuries in areas such as factories, construction sites, mines, oil rigs and ports. Lidar technology can also enhance public welfare through security and smart city applications. In addition, our solutions are being used in applications such as touchless delivery, sanitation and physical distance tracking, which are advancing safety and health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Business Combination

On September 30, 2020, Graf Industrial Corp. (“Graf”), the Company’s predecessor and a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”), consummated a business combination with the pre-combination Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (the “Business Combination”). On September 30, 2020, Velodyne Lidar’s common stock and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “VLDR” and “VLDRW,” respectively.
Our Technology Platform
Our hardware and software solutions center around our proprietary lidar sensor technology, which enables real-time, three-dimensional vision of the surrounding environment for a breadth of autonomous and intelligent systems.
To perceive the environment in 3D, our sensors emit a series of laser pulses, typically millions of pulses each second, which bounce off objects in the environment and return to the sensors. Our devices measure the time each pulse traveled and uses highly sophisticated, real-time algorithms to create digital, machine-readable maps of the surrounding environment. These maps have up to centimeter-level precision and capture rich detail around the sensors. Since the maps are continually refreshed every few milliseconds, they can be used to perceive both static and dynamic objects. Unlike cameras that are two-dimensional and radar that is not capable of high-definition imaging, our lidar captures a precise, high definition, three-dimensional view of the environment. These characteristics make our lidar technology an ideal sensor platform for cars, robots and other autonomous machines to perceive the world as they move through it. 
Our Product Portfolio
Using an array of eye-safe lasers, our lidar solutions measure distances in the environment at the speed of light. Unlike camera-based solutions, lidar solutions allow machines to see in 3D by providing precise distance measurements of surrounding objects. Lidar also performs better than cameras in low light conditions and produces fewer errors. Compared to radar, lidar provides better resolution, perceiving objects’ shapes for superior object detection and classification. Lidar also performs better than cameras in darkened conditions and produces fewer errors. Lidar systems currently being tested can detect pedestrians equally well during daytime and nighttime conditions because the systems provide self-illumination by means of laser beams. Together with lower computing power requirements, these features enable autonomous platforms to make fast and accurate decisions to mitigate collisions. Velodyne’s proprietary lidar-based hardware and software solutions combine class-leading range, up to centimeter-level accuracy and lower power consumption with high-grade reliability.
Surround View Lidar
We offer a broad lineup of surround-view lidar to support numerous end applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, security, mobile robots and mapping. 
Alpha Prime (VLS-128) is our flagship surround-view lidar capable of 300-meter range, specifically made for autonomous driving and advanced vehicle safety at highway speeds. The lidar sensor incorporates 128 lasers and provides real-time 3D data up to 0.1-degree vertical and horizontal resolution. The Alpha Prime provides a superior combination of range, resolution and precision to enable Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous vehicles to function both at highway speeds as well as in low-speed urban environments. We were recognized with the Pace Automotive Award for this product.
Ultra Puck (VLP-32) is the third generation of the Puck family. The high-density, long-range image generated by the Ultra Puck makes it a desirable solution for robotics, mapping, security, driver assistance and autonomous navigation. The Ultra Puck also enables our Intelligent Infrastructure Solutions (IIS) discussed below under “-Software.” Ultra Puck uses 32 lasers to double the range and resolution of its predecessor at a range of up to 200 meters. Ultra Puck also introduces firing exclusion and advanced features designed to minimize false positives. The compact design is small and light enough to be placed below a car’s side-view mirror and reduces the cost of the system required for a fully-autonomous vehicle.
Puck (VLP-16) offers 16 lasers and a 100-meter range. Developed with mass production and affordability in mind, the Puck retains the multi-laser design of our other sensors while offering lower power consumption, lighter weight and a more compact footprint at an attractive price point, making it suitable for low speed autonomy and driver assistance applications.
Puck Hi-Res (VLP-16 Hi-Res) is a further iteration of the original Puck and is designed for applications requiring high image resolution. While retaining surround view and 100-meter range, this sensor compresses the vertical field-of-view from 30 degrees to 20 degrees for a tighter laser distribution spaced at 1.33 degrees instead of 2.00 degrees. This design delivers more details in the 3D image at longer ranges and enables the host system to not only detect but also better identify objects at these greater distances. 
Puck LITE (VLP-16 LITE) weighs 590 grams and was designed expressly to address the exacting requirements of the UAV and aerial 3D mapping markets. Puck LITE achieves the performance of the original Puck while reducing the sensor weight by approximately 30 percent, enabling longer flight times. This lightweight, high-performance sensor retains 360-degree surround view to capture real-time 3D lidar data.
HDL-32E was released in response to demand for a more compact and lighter sensor and Velodyne’s second-generation 3D lidar solution extends the core 360-degree technology developed for the HDL-64E, the world’s first commercially available real-time 3D lidar. The HDL-32E features 32 lasers aligned over a 40-degree vertical field-of-view, and can generate up to 1.39 million points per second. The HDL-32E measures 5.7 inches high by 3.4 inches wide, weighs less than 2 kilograms and is developed to meet stringent military and automotive environmental specifications.
Solid State Lidar
Our solid state lidar technology combines the reliability and lifetime of traditional micro electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”) solutions while also providing longer sensing range.
Velarray M1600 is designed for autonomous applications in sidewalk, commercial and industrial settings, the Velarray M1600 provides outstanding near-field perception at a range of 0.1 to 30 meters for safe navigation in diverse environmental conditions. The Velarray M1600’s optimal combination of data-rich resolution and broad field-of-view enables precise mapping and obstacle avoidance. With a durable design, this sensor is aesthetically well-suited for external mounting and easily embeddable in a robot’s sensor compartment. The Velarray M1600 features our micro-lidar array (“MLA”) architecture, a robust and reliable design for mass production.
Velarray H800 delivers a solid state lidar sensor for ADAS and autonomous applications. The Velarray H800’s range – from .01 to 200 meters – combined with wide horizontal field of view (“FOV”) detect objects early to enable safe stopping distances in urban driving scenarios and collision avoidance on curves and turns. Its vertical FOV can provide detection of near-range small and overhead objects, while covering corner use-cases including sloping roads. The Velarray H800’s range enables advanced highway ADAS features such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist, and Automatic Emergency Braking. With a configurable frame rate, the Velarray H800 offers point cloud density for high resolution mapping and object classification tasks. The Velarray H800 also features our MLA architecture.

Approximately 200 of those customers were in non-automotive markets. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. We define the number of customers as the number of customers for which we have received an order for one or more of our products. A single organization or customer may represent multiple customers due to separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries.
We have various multi-year agreements with customers, including non-automotive customers and automotive customers such as OEMs and system integrators. These agreements generally provide for one-year demand forecasts, with quarterly volumes and prices for the year. After the first year, we and the customer have the ability to evaluate need and price for subsequent forecasts. These agreements provide unit discounts for both volume commitments and marketing commitments. These multi-year agreements also provide terms and conditions of sale that are negotiated based on price and volume commitment. 
We have built an extensive ecosystem in the markets we serve. We have distribution partners in Asia and Europe to address growing market opportunities in these regions and beyond. In North America, we sell directly to most of our customers as well as through three national distributors who are also our customers and integrators. We also sell our solutions through our customer service hubs around the world, such as Germany and China, where we maintain offices and staff.
Manufacturing
We have dedicated teams focused on manufacturing processes, such as those that include proprietary alignment and calibration techniques. Our teams leverage automation steps to lower manufacturing times, improve yield and position us and our manufacturing partners to produce at increasing scale as our customers’ requirements increase. We expect to reduce our in-house manufacturing and increasingly leverage the experience of our current and future manufacturing partners. We plan to expand our manufacturing partnerships in 2022 to include VLS-128 and Velarray by transferring these products currently manufactured in-house to qualified external manufacturing partners.
Industry and Competition
There is an increasing demand for lidar to help advance automated systems with the goal of increasing safety, improving efficiency and enhance productivity. Lidar’s status as a critical sensor in many applications gives us the opportunity to add higher value to customers by providing comprehensive solutions. There is increasing adoption of lidar across a wide variety of industries, some of which are accelerating in a post-COVID world. 
For the automotive industry, SAE International has published a taxonomy with detailed definitions for six levels of driving automation, ranging from no automation to full automation. To increase road safety and respond to regulatory requirements, we believe automotive manufacturers are proactively adopting ADAS technology. As industry participants develop active safety features, standards defining the increasing levels of sophistication in these features are required. We are working with SAE International and other major professional and standardization organizations to guide the relevant regulations that address public safety.
Additionally, we believe businesses are actively exploring the use of autonomous trucks, drones and robots to help create more efficient and less expensive delivery infrastructure to meet consumer demand for fast and cost-efficient delivery 
solutions. As a result, we believe there is a continual need for precise 3D mapping information to understand the surrounding environment and movement patterns to improve transportation logistics and enhance traffic efficiency.
The market for perception solutions for autonomous applications is an emerging market, with many potential applications in the development stage. As a result, we face competition from a range of companies seeking to have their products incorporated into these applications that are being developed and it may take a long period of time for our primary competitors to emerge. Our competitors are also working to advance technology, reliability and innovation in their development of new and improved solutions. Although we believe that we have market-leading technology, we continue to face competition from existing competitors and new companies emerging in the lidar, camera and radar industries. It is our belief that it will take most of these new smaller companies a substantial period of time to gain the recognition and trust of top-tier automotive OEMs, as well as customers and partners in other non-automotive industries. Many of our competitors offer products targeted for niche applications. Some competitors are currently selling products that offer lower levels of performance in ADAS and new markets. In the ADAS market, a number of competitors have already achieved substantial market share using camera and radar-based perception sensing solutions, although we believe we offer a higher performance product that empowers higher performance ADAS systems, which we believe have the potential to displace current offerings and increase our market share. 
Market Opportunity
Our technology enables autonomy and can create new markets. Traditionally, many autonomous and 3D vision-based sensing applications were developed by utilizing non-lidar sensors; however, as the benefits of lidar-based solutions are becoming more widely recognized, we believe there are significant market opportunities available for our technology. As autonomous and 3D vision-based applications continue to grow more complex, we believe our technologies will become increasingly adopted due to our innovation, leadership, scale, and commercial readiness.
We expect demand in the automotive market to be driven by regulatory and customer demand for lidar solutions. Based on third party data, we estimate that the total market size for vehicles deploying lidar technology will be approximately over three million vehicles by 2026. Generally, the number of lidar sensors to be deployed on each vehicle in the market depends on the level of autonomy and the type of lidar sensors utilized, which we expect to range from one to four sensors. We believe that, in most cases, more lidar sensors, or at least lidar sensors with greater functionality, will be required as the level of autonomy increases towards full autonomy. In addition to the automotive market, we believe there are significant market opportunities available for our technology in the industrial, drones, autonomous mobile robots and 3D mapping end-markets that we are actively engaging with customers on. Within the industrial sector there are four primary drivers of lidar adoption:
–Logistics, which includes Port Terminal AGV, autonomous trucks, warehouse AMRs and AGVs, delivery robots, construction and mining. Based on third party estimates from Yole, we believe logistics will be a strong growth driver, with double digit unit growth expected through 2026, yielding over 250,000 lidar units annually by that time.
–Smart Infrastructure, which includes traffic monitoring, security, airport security, smart infrastructure, automated doors and automated retail. All of these applications are in early development and are largely unexplored and emerging, which we refer to as greenfield applications; however, we believe that, with the current government infrastructure spending, this market can grow rapidly over the next five years and, according to Yole, the market is expected to scale to over 200,000 lidar units by 2026.
–Manufacturing, which includes factory automation and smart farming applications, in which lidar is used to aid in autonomous machine maneuvering and operation. We believe this is a rapidly growing segment as supply chains and workforces remain impacted globally.
–Mapping, which includes applications such as aerial, indoor and underground mapping, construction, digital twins, disaster recovery, forestry, safety and survey inspections. According to Global Market Insights, the lidar in mapping market size is expected to exceed $4.0 billion by 2026. The expected market growth reflects the increasing demand for autonomous vehicles and drones, which is creating the need for accurate mapping data.

Research and Development
We have invested a significant amount of time and expense into research and development of lidar-based technologies. Our ability to maintain our leadership position depends in part on our ongoing research and development activities. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, manufacturing and testing of our products. We focus our efforts on development in the areas of novel lidar architecture, advanced product design, innovative manufacturing technologies and advanced algorithms. In addition, we are transitioning from field programmable gate arrays to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in order to further improve performance of our products, lower costs and reduce reliance on any key suppliers. 
Our research and development is largely conducted at our headquarters in San Jose, California. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 187 full time employees engaged in our research and development activities.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to be at the forefront of innovation in the lidar market depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relating to our key technology, and our ability to successfully enforce these rights against third parties. We currently have proprietary intellectual property, including in our embedded software, real-time 3D vision for autonomous systems, manufacturing processes and calibration methodology, which we believe is strongly protected by our registered patents. We have also filed patents and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights. We also protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our customers and channel partners.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 35 issued and 3 allowed U.S. patents and 59 pending U.S. patent applications. These issued patents begin expiring in 2027. We also have in the aggregate 247 issued non-U.S. patents, pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications and non-U.S. national stage applications corresponding to various U.S. patent applications described above.
The applications and issued patents cover a broad range of system level and component level aspects of lidar technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the 
examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there is no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection.
Government Regulation
We are subject to the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that will require us to diligence, disclose and report whether our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products.
In addition, our operations are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as amended, (“OSHA”), and comparable international, state and local laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
At both the federal and state level, the U.S. has provided a positive legal environment to permit safe testing and development of autonomous functionality. We do not anticipate any near-term standards that would impede the foreseeable deployments of our lidar technology. 
As the principal legal and regulatory authority for vehicle safety, the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) establishes Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (the “FMVSS”) for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment. The Agency oversees the actions that manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment are required to take regarding the reporting of information related to defects or injuries related to their products and the recall and repair of vehicles and equipment that contain safety defects or fail to comply with the FMVSS. 
As the vehicles that carry our sensors go into production, we are subject to existing stringent requirements under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Vehicle Safety Act”), including a duty to report safety defects with our products. The Vehicle Safety Act imposes potentially significant civil penalties for violations including the failure to comply with such reporting requirements. We are also subject to the existing U.S. Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act (“TREAD”), which requires equipment manufacturers to comply with “Early Warning” requirements by reporting certain information to the NHTSA, such as information related to defects or reports of injury related to their products. TREAD imposes criminal liability for violating such requirements if a defect subsequently causes death or bodily injury. In addition, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain safety defects or fail to comply with U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards. Sales into foreign countries may be subject to similar regulations. As the development of federal, state, and international regulation of autonomous systems and vehicles continues to evolve, we may be subject to additional regulatory schemes.
In addition, we are subject to the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These requirements are enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Electronic product radiation includes laser technology. Regulations governing these products are intended to protect the public from hazardous or unnecessary exposure. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products.
In order for us to operate in international markets outside the U.S., we may also be required to comply with relevant federal and foreign legal regulations regarding autonomous vehicles as well as technology export control, data security, cybersecurity, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act (“ITAR”), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act  and other related regulations that apply to global technology companies. We have developed compliance processes and procedures related to these regulatory requirements and believe that we are in compliance with such requirements. We do not believe there are any regulatory restrictions that would materially restrict our ability to operate in our key markets. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 407 people. We also engage numerous consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have strong and positive relations with our employees. We are focused on aligning our valued human capital resources to our strategic priorities with a strong focus on leadership development, employee engagement and company culture. As part of our commitment to employee development, we make ongoing investments in our team, including hiring a Chief People Officer in October 2020 to lead our global human resources organization.
Our company culture is focused on honesty, integrity, dignity and respect, and our Code of Conduct is designed to help us achieve the right results, the right way. The code establishes high standards of honesty and integrity for all employees, officers and directors, and expects the same high standards of contractors, consultants, suppliers and agents. The specific policies set forth in the code help ensure that we conduct our business fairly and ethically in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner.
