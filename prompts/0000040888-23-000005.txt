We are currently in the process of seeking zoning changes and other governmental approvals on our excess real estate assets.
L3Harris Merger Agreement
On December 17, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), with L3Harris and Aquila Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of L3Harris ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") with the Company being the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of L3Harris.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each share of the Company's common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $58.00 in cash, without interest, plus, if the closing occurs after September 17, 2023, $0.0025 for each calendar day elapsed after such date to and including the closing date.
Closing of the Merger is anticipated to occur in 2023, subject to various customary conditions, including our stockholder approval and regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"). 
Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin") Terminated Merger Agreement
On December 20, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Lockheed Terminated Merger Agreement") with Lockheed Martin and Mizar Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, pursuant to which each share of common stock of the Company would have been automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $51.00 per share, adjusted from $56.00 following the payment of a one-time cash dividend of $5.00 per share paid in March 2021, and the Company would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin (the "Terminated Merger"). 
On January 25, 2022, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") filed a complaint against the Company and Lockheed Martin in the FTC’s administrative court and a complaint in U.S. federal court seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the deal pending an administrative trial. On February 13, 2022, Lockheed Martin notified the Company that it had elected to terminate the Lockheed Terminated Merger Agreement. On February 14, 2022, pursuant to the parties’ joint motion, the administrative complaint and the U.S. federal court complaint were dismissed.
Aerospace and Defense 
Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized technology-based engineering and manufacturing company that develops and produces specialized power and propulsion systems, as well as armament systems. We develop and manufacture liquid and solid rocket propulsion, air-breathing hypersonic engines, and electric power and propulsion for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Principal customers and end users include the DoD (including the U.S. Air Force ("USAF"), U.S. Space Force, U.S. Army, Missile Defense Agency ("MDA"), and U.S. Navy), NASA, The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies Corporation ("Raytheon"), Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop"), and United Launch Alliance ("ULA"). 
We have demonstrated a legacy of successfully meeting the most challenging missions by producing some of the world’s most technologically advanced propulsion systems to meet our nation's critical needs. We believe we maintain a unique 
competitive position due to our strategic focus on creating and maintaining a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for our innovative energy management technologies. The highly reliable nature of our revenue comes from the long-term nature of the programs with which we are involved, our attractive contract base and our deep customer relationships. High renewal rates, supported by our market leading technology, provide us with a highly stable business base from which to grow. As of December 31, 2022, our remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $6.8 billion and our funded backlog, which includes only amounts for which funding has been authorized by a customer and a purchase order has been received, totaled $3.1 billion. 
Primary Markets and Programs 
The markets and key programs we serve are: 
Aerospace. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion and power systems for space applications. Our products include a broad market offering of both electric and chemical propulsion, including liquid propellant engines and solid rocket motors required for launch vehicle and in-space applications supporting defense, civil and commercial missions.
Our key space programs include: (i) RS-25 main and RL10 upper-stage engines that power NASA’s Space Launch System ("SLS"); (ii) RL10 engines that power ULA launch vehicles; (iii) propulsion for the Orion spacecraft and the Starliner Commercial Crew Transportation Capability capsule; (iv) power systems for spacecraft, space stations and rovers; (v) multiple electric and chemical propulsion systems that provide in-space maneuvering capability for spacecraft and satellites; and (vi) chemical propulsion for reaction control systems for launch vehicles.
One of our most exciting accomplishments in 2022 was powering the historic launch of Artemis I; the first launch of NASA’s new mega Moon rocket, the SLS. We provided propulsive elements for the Artemis I mission, as well as high pressure tanks. SLS launched using four shuttle-derived RS-25 main engines on the core stage and one RL10 engine on the upper stage. Artemis I, a three-week mission to cislunar space and back with NASA’s Orion spacecraft, was the first in a series of increasingly complex missions that will enable the return of humans to the Moon and eventually their exploration of Mars. 
With the uncrewed Artemis I mission complete, we are beginning preparations with NASA for crewed Artemis flights, and we believe we are positioned to continue supporting the program going forward. We are under contract to build new production RS-25 engines to support Artemis V through IX. The certification process for verifying the new production engine configuration began with an RS-25 confidence test in December 2022. The certification test series will continue throughout 2023.
In addition to the propulsion on NASA’s SLS rocket, we also supply the majority of propulsion aboard the Orion spacecraft and a key component of the Launch Abort System, the jettison motor. In 2022, we received a contract option from Lockheed Martin for the procurement of propulsion systems for the Orion spacecraft that will fly on Artemis missions VI through VIII. This contract option includes delivery of three additional sets of Orion’s service module auxiliary engines and three additional jettison motors. We continue to make progress on the Orion Main Engine contract awarded in 2021.
Aerojet Rocketdyne is also on contract to provide NASA the Advanced Electric Propulsion System for the Power and Propulsion Element ("PPE") of the agency’s Gateway platform. The PPE is intended to ferry crews and cargo between high and low lunar orbit as part of the Artemis program. 
Our propulsion and power systems have a long and distinguished flight heritage with the U.S. government and commercial customers. We provide liquid propulsion systems for the first and upper stages of ULA’s Delta IV heavy launch vehicle, as well as the liquid upper-stage propulsion for their Atlas V launch vehicle. ULA’s new Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle is expected to make its inaugural flight in 2023 and we are under contract to supply RL10 upper-stage engines for each Vulcan Centaur mission, as well as reaction control thrusters. 
In 2022, ULA awarded Aerojet Rocketdyne to deliver RL10C-X engines for its Vulcan Centaur rocket. The new engines will support ULA as it works to fulfill its commitments under a contract it received from Amazon, as part of the largest commercial launch contract in history, to support the launch of Amazon’s Project Kuiper satellites. The RL10C-X will extend the six-decade flight heritage of the RL10 family of engines by incorporating new upgrades, including a 3D-printed injector and combustion chamber, as well as a lightweight composite nozzle.
In 2022, NASA’s first planetary defense mission, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test ("DART") mission, used our hydrazine thrusters to successfully position the DART spacecraft in order to collide with a small asteroid to change its orbit. 
Fission surface power continues to be a growth area for our company. We are on a team (led by Westinghouse of Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania) that was awarded a contract by NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy for a Phase One Nuclear Fission Surface Power contract to provide an initial design concept for a fission surface power system that could be ready to launch to the Moon by the end of the decade.
2022 was a year of firsts and we look forward to continuing to supply power and propulsion systems for NASA’s Artemis program, ULA’s family of rockets, Starliner’s first crewed flight, and a variety of power and in-space propulsion systems in 2023.
Defense. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion systems for defense applications including both solid and liquid propellant based systems, along with air-breathing (ramjet and hypersonic scramjet) systems for missile applications. The majority of these applications are the primary axial propulsion for missile systems. We also develop and manufacture divert and attitude control ("DACs") propulsion (solid propellant and liquid-fueled) systems for missile defense applications. These are complex systems that provide multi-directional and variable thrust levels to steer or control an intercept missile. Additionally, we develop and manufacture post-boost propulsion systems for strategic missiles. These systems provide directional control for ground and sea-based strategic missiles. Using our energetics expertise we also design, develop, and produce warhead/lethality systems for tactical missiles and stored chemical energy propulsion for torpedoes. Our products have 
been successfully fielded on multiple active U.S. and international weapon system platforms. The breadth of our applications includes tactical missiles, missile defense interceptors, hypersonic systems, strategic boosters and post-boost systems and torpedo propulsion for a variety of applications.
During 2022, we continued to expand our strong legacy propulsion franchises on the Standard Missile, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 ("PAC-3"), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ("THAAD") and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System ("GMLRS") missile programs. On the THAAD program, we were awarded a multi-year production contract with Lockheed Martin for propulsion elements to include the Liquid Divert and Attitude Control ("LDACs") and Solid Rocket Motor ("SRM") Booster. These franchise programs continue to be globally deployed in support of U.S. and allied armed forces. 
In the hypersonic propulsion arena, an advanced Aerojet Rocketdyne scramjet engine powered the successful 2022 flight test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept ("HAWC"), in a joint effort with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA"), Air Force Research Laboratory ("AFRL"), and Lockheed Martin. Additionally, in January 2023, a second successful flight test was executed for DARPA by Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne. Significant scramjet performance data was collected on this flight that reached speeds in excess of Mach 5, travelled more than 300 nautical miles and reached altitudes above 60,000 feet. Further, we continued technology maturation and ground testing at in-house and U.S. government facilities on scramjet and ramjet propulsion systems to support emerging U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy programs. 
Our Aerojet Rocketdyne Coleman Aerospace ("Coleman") business continued to expand both its production backlog and technical capability of the medium-range ballistic missile ("MRBM") target program. We were awarded the third lot of production targets that will incorporate advanced propulsion technology. These technologies include a new large SRM (designated eSR-19) that was successfully validated with a static firing at the AFRL. 
We opened our Center of Excellence for Undersea Propulsion to support the U.S. Navy's next generation torpedoes at our Coleman site. This facility will be used to produce the innovative undersea propulsion known as Stored Chemical Energy Propulsion ("SCEPS") and the entire torpedo afterbody. Upon completion of the new facility and in support of the MK54 lightweight torpedo proof of manufacturing program, we successfully built and tested a SCEPS lithium boiler that could be used to power the U.S. Navy’s next generation torpedoes. We will also power the U.S. Navy’s new Compact Rapid Attack Weapon ("CRAW") as part of the Raytheon Missiles & Defense team building the next generation torpedo. 
A subset of our key defense programs include: (i) Boosters and Solid DACs for the U.S. Navy’s Standard Missile family, (ii) Booster and LDACs for THAAD, (iii) PAC-3, (iv) GMLRS, (v) Stinger, (vi) Javelin, (vii) Patriot GEM-T, (viii) Tactical Tomahawk, (ix) Army Tactical Missile Systems ("ATACMS"), (x) Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided ("TOW") warhead, (xi) Next Generation Interceptor ("NGI"), and (xii) Ground Based Strategic Deterrent ("GBSD").
Information concerning the percentage of net sales attributable to our significant programs appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Major Customers." 
Competition
The competitive dynamics of our business vary by product type and customer, but we experience many of the same challenges as the broader aerospace and defense industry. The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely difficult or hazardous to build, which requires rigorous manufacturing systems and highly specialized manufacturing equipment. While historically these factors contributed to substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (such as additive manufacturing) are enabling new entrants with the funding to enter this industry, leading to increased competition. For example, competitors such as SpaceX and Blue Origin have developed propulsion systems for their satellite and space launch vehicles. These new competitors have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are willing to take on substantial risk exposure on development programs with unproven market potential and are, therefore, disrupting existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies. Additionally, Northrop is a longstanding competitor for nearly all of the Company’s propulsion products. For in-space propulsion, customer demand for small satellites is rapidly expanding, and small satellites are increasingly displacing large satellites, which comprise the core end use for the Company’s in-space propulsion products. We see a number of new startups entering into the supply of liquid, chemical, and electric propulsion systems for small launch vehicles and satellites. In missiles and missile defense systems, the U.S. government has utilized its resources to facilitate entry and expansion by propulsion suppliers in order to shore up the U.S. rocket propulsion industrial base. For example, the Naval Surface Warfare Center has partnered with both Nammo Energetics Indian Head ("Nammo") and MBDA Incorporated ("MBDA") to support the development of solid propulsion, and DARPA and AFRL have awarded Small Business Innovation Research contracts to Innoveering, LLC in support of its air-breathing hypersonic propulsion development.

Industry Overview 
Our primary aerospace and defense customers include DoD, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We rely on U.S. government funding for aerospace and defense and our backlog depends, in large part, on the continued funding by the U.S. government for these programs. With the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 ("Public Law 117-328") on December 29, 2022, DoD and NASA are funded for the remainder of government fiscal year 2023. In light of continued Russian actions in Ukraine, Public Law 117-328 also included the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2023, to provide aid, equipment, and munitions to Ukraine. Disruptions to our customer’s facilities or delays in supply chain as a result of global events could delay or decrease expenditures by U.S. government agencies. Such a decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
Major Customers 
Information concerning major customers appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Major Customers." 
Contract Types 
Research and development ("R&D") contracts are awarded during the early stages of a program’s development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature products for operational use. Our contracts are largely categorized as either "fixed-price" (largely used by the U.S. government for production-type contracts) or "cost-
reimbursable" (largely used by the U.S. government for development-type contracts). During 2022, approximately 55% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts and 45% from cost-reimbursable contracts. 
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) firm fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price level of effort contracts. For firm fixed-price contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs during contract performance. For fixed-price-incentive fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives increased or decreased fees (or profits) based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the customer’s labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in lower than expected contract profit margin and losses. Given broader inflation in the economy, we are monitoring the risk inflation presents to active and future contracts. To date, we have not seen broad-based increases in costs from inflation that are material to our business as a whole; however, if we begin to experience greater than expected supply chain and labor inflation our profits and margins under our contracts, in particular fixed price contracts, could be adversely affected.
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne typically receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared with contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule. 
In addition, Other Transaction Agreement ("OTA") contracts are becoming more prevalent in the developmental stages of U.S. government procurements. An OTA is a special vehicle used by federal agencies for obtaining or advancing R&D or prototypes. The U.S. government's procurement regulations and certain procurement statutes do not apply to OTAs, and accordingly, other transaction authority gives agencies the flexibility necessary to develop agreements tailored to a particular transaction. Generally, our sales and backlog figures do not include work we have under contracts obligated by the customer under an OTA as our share of the contract costs are recognized as company-funded R&D. 
Government Contracts and Regulations 
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"), agency-specific regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to U.S. government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustments, mandatory disclosure, and audit requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines that could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to routine audits, reviews, and investigations by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), the Defense Contract Management Agency, and other similar U.S. government agencies. Such reviews include but are not limited to our contract performance, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards as well as the review of the adequacy of our accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting systems. 
The U.S. government’s ability to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed (including severance costs for terminated employees), and our profit would be limited based on the work completed prior to termination. 
Additional information about the risks relating to government contracts and regulations appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report. 
Backlog 
Information concerning backlog appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Backlog." 
Seasonality 
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business is not subject to predictable seasonality. Primary factors affecting the timing of our sales include the timing of U.S. government awards, the availability of U.S. government funding, contractual product delivery requirements, and customer acceptances. 
Research and Development
We view R&D efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we compete. Our R&D is primarily supported by customer funding. Our company-funded R&D efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes. See Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on R&D expenditures.
Suppliers and Raw Materials 
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances beyond our control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to our program performance and cost. 
 Availability of raw materials and supplies has been generally sufficient. We sometimes are dependent, for a variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and have, in some instances in the past, experienced difficulties meeting production and delivery obligations because of delays in delivery or reliance on such suppliers. Further, we continue to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, electronic components, and constituent chemicals. Finally, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often limited to procuring materials from certain suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. 
Additional information about the risks relating to suppliers and raw materials appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report. 
Intellectual Property 
Where appropriate, Aerojet Rocketdyne obtains patents in the U.S. and other countries for new and useful processes, machines, manufactures or compositions of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof relating to its products and services. Our patents are maintained through the statutory limit of time, which is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application, where the claimed invention has value in the markets in which we compete. We rely on trade secret protection for financial, technical and personnel information that provides an economic competitive advantage by virtue of not being known by the relevant public and ordinarily require employees to sign confidentiality agreements as a condition to employment. If properly protected, trade secrets can be maintained in perpetuity. Aerojet Rocketdyne takes reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of its trade secrets in order to maintain protection under applicable state and federal laws. As our products and services typically embody complex systems that include many technologies, we do not believe any single existing patent, license, or trade secret is material to our success.
Real Estate 
We own 11,277 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento ("Sacramento Land"). Acquired in the early 1950s and historically used for our aerospace and defense operations, large portions were used solely to provide safe buffer zones around hazardous operations. Modern changes in propulsion technology coupled with the relocation of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to re-entitle the Sacramento Land for new uses and explore various opportunities to optimize its value.
The Sacramento Land is made up of 5,203 acres previously used for our aerospace and defense operations, 628 acres available for future entitlement, and 5,446 acres for future development under the brand name "Easton". Easton has 3,904 acres that are fully entitled. The term "entitlement" is generally used to denote the required set of regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for new requested uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each jurisdiction and each zoning proposal and may include permits, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and others prior to construction. 
As Easton continues to execute re-entitlement and pre-development activities, we are pursuing a variety of monetization options and are exploring how to maximize value from Easton. Value creation and monetization may include outright land sales and/or joint ventures with real estate developers, residential builders, and/or other third parties. We believe the long-term prospect for the Sacramento region represents an attractive and affordable alternative to the San Francisco Bay Area and other large metropolitan areas of California. 
The following table summarizes the Sacramento Land (in acres): 

 | EnvironmentallyUnrestricted | EnvironmentallyRestricted (1) | | Total | Entitled
Glenborough and Easton Place | 1,043 | | 349 | | 1,392 | 1,392
Rio del Oro | 1,818 | | 491 | | 2,309 | 2,309
Westborough | 1,270 | | 272 | | 1,542 | — 
Hillsborough (2) | 51 | | 97 | | 148 | 148 
Office Park and Auto Mall | 47 | | 8 | | 55 | 55 
Total Easton acreage | 4,229 | | 1,217 | | 5,446 | 3,904
Former operations land (3) | 24 | | 5,179 | | 5,203 | 
Land available for future entitlement (4) | 386 | | 242 | | 628 | 
Total Sacramento Land | 4,639 | | 6,638 | | 11,277 | 

_________
(1)    Indicates land subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 8(b) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land. 
(2) The remaining 148 acres designated in Hillsborough will be transferred, per the completed purchase and sale contract from 2015, when the required environmental remediation work is completed. 
(3)    In 2019, we completed our manufacturing commitments in our Sacramento, California facility and transitioned the Sacramento site to host our shared services function. 
(4)    We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time. 
Leasing 
We currently lease office space to various third parties that generated $2.4 million in revenue in 2022. 
Environmental Matters 
Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations, and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Under existing U.S. environmental laws, Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs"), are jointly and severally liable, and therefore we are potentially liable to the U.S. government or other third parties for the full cost of remediating the contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites where we have been designated as a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or state environmental agencies. The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities requires significant management judgment to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future costs that may be required for remediation measures. Further, environmental standards change from time to time. However, we perform quarterly reviews of these matters and accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability, usually based on proportionate sharing, can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities have not been discounted to their present value as the amounts and timing of cash payments are not fixed or reliably determinable. 
On January 12, 1999, we reached a settlement agreement ("Global Settlement") with the U.S. government covering environmental costs associated with our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site. Pursuant to the Global Settlement, we can recover up to 88% of our environmental remediation costs through the establishment of prices for Aerojet Rocketdyne's products and services sold to the U.S. government. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the Electronics and Information Systems business in 2001, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into an agreement with Northrop (the "Northrop Agreement") whereby Aerojet Rocketdyne is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to an annual billing limitation of $6.0 million and a cumulative limitation of $189.7 million. 
Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowed to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government. 
The inclusion of environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government impacts our competitive pricing; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers.
We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2022 nor do we anticipate any material capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part II, Item 7 "Environmental Matters" and "Environmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries " of this Report for additional information.

 We believe our success depends on the strength of our workforce and our culture of accountability, adaptability, excellence, integrity and teamwork. Our integrated human capital management strategy enables and develops this culture and includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent, as well as the design of compensation and benefits programs, to deliver on our strategy. 
Employees - As of December 31, 2022, 7% of our 5,283 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and unions are good.
Development - We enable our employees to reach their full potential by providing a wide range of career development opportunities, skill development and resources they need to be successful. Our Rocket University learning platform supplements our talent development strategies and enables employees to access instructor-led, in-person and virtual courses, as well as self-directed, web-based courses. Our Talent Management process includes ongoing performance ‘check-ins’ and leader-focused Talent Reviews and Succession Planning, which provide for the formal identification and development of our next generation leaders, and the building of a robust talent pipeline for key roles across the enterprise. We encourage advancement and movement across our organization to fill our open positions with strong and experienced management talent and individual contributors.
Inclusion, Diversity and Engagement ("ID&E") – We believe in the strength of engaged and diverse teams in an inclusive work environment to unleash the potential of our employees. Through the efforts of these diverse and collaborative teams, we seek to be on the cutting edge of technology and exceed customer expectations. We have established a corporate-wide ID&E council and a number of executive-sponsored employee resource groups ("ERG") across the enterprise, where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. Our ERGs support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally. To assess and improve employee engagement, we survey our employees and take actions to address areas of employee concern.
Health and Safety - Safety is one of our core values. We are committed to a safe work environment for our employees as well as being good stewards of the natural environment.
Retention – The labor market has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and other global economic factors, causing more competition among employers, including us, and making it more difficult to find and retain quality employees. We are also periodically subject to our competitors seeking to entice our employees to leave the Company.
