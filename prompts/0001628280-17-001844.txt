ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed in 1947. We are a diversified energy company engaged, through our operating divisions and subsidiaries, in various energy and other businesses. We operate primarily on the Delmarva Peninsula and in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio and provide natural gas distribution, transmission, supply, gathering, processing and marketing; electric distribution and generation; propane distribution; propane and crude oil wholesale marketing; steam generation; and other energy-related services.

REGULATED ENERGY
Regulated Energy is our largest segment and consists of: (i) our natural gas distribution operations in Delaware, Maryland and Florida; (ii) our electric distribution operations in Florida; and (iii) our natural gas transmission operations on the Delmarva Peninsula and in Florida. All operations in this segment are regulated, as to their rates and service, by the PSC having jurisdiction in each state in which we operate or by the FERC in the case of Eastern Shore. Our natural gas and electric distribution operations are local distribution utilities and generate revenues based on tariff rates approved by the PSC of each state in which we operate. The PSCs have also authorized our utilities to negotiate rates, based on approved methodologies, with customers that have competitive alternatives. Some of our customers in Maryland are, and will continue to be, served with propane through our underground propane distribution system under PSC-approved tariff rates until we complete the conversion of the system and these customers to natural gas. These customers are included in the Delmarva natural gas distribution operation's results and customer statistics.
Eastern Shore generates revenues based upon the FERC-approved tariff rates. Eastern Shore is also authorized by the FERC to negotiate rates with its customers above or below the FERC-approved tariff rates. Peninsula Pipeline, our Florida intrastate pipeline subsidiary, is subject to regulation by the Florida PSC and has negotiated contracts with customers, including certain affiliates. Our rates are designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently incurred costs and provide a return 
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2016 Form 10-K Page  3

on our rate base that is sufficient to pay interest on debt and a reasonable return for our stockholders. Each of our utilities has a rate base, which generally consists of the original cost of the utility's plant less related accumulated depreciation, working capital and certain other assets. In certain jurisdictions, the rate base may also include deferred income tax liabilities and other additions or deductions.
The natural gas commodity market for Chesapeake Utilities' Florida division and FPU’s Indiantown division is deregulated. Accordingly, marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in those jurisdictions. For all of our other local distribution utilities, we have fuel cost recovery mechanisms authorized by the PSCs that allow us to periodically adjust fuel rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and electricity and to ensure we recover all of the costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas and electricity for our customers.

(1) Eastern Shore's service to our local distribution affiliates is based on FERC-approved rates and is an integral component of the cost associated with providing natural gas supplies for those affiliates. We eliminate operating revenues of Eastern Shore against the cost of sales of those affiliates in our consolidated financial information; however, our local distribution affiliates include this amount in their purchased fuel cost and recover it through fuel cost recovery mechanisms.
(2) Operating revenues from "Other" sources are from the rental of gas properties. 
Peninsula Pipeline contracts with both affiliated and non-affiliated customers to provide firm transportation service. For the year ended December 31, 2016, operating revenues of Peninsula Pipeline were $6.8 million, of which $4.5 million was related to service to our affiliates, FPU and Eight Flags, under contracts which were previously approved by the Florida PSC. Peninsula Pipeline's operating revenues from FPU and Eight Flags are eliminated against the cost of sales in our consolidated financial information; however, FPU includes this amount in its purchased fuel cost and recovers it through the fuel cost recovery mechanism.
As of December 31, 2016, our investments in our regulated operations were as follows: $126.1 million for Delmarva natural gas distribution; $290.4 million for Florida natural gas and electric distribution; and $186.5 million for natural gas transmission. 
Weather
Revenues from our residential and commercial sales are affected by seasonal variations in weather conditions, which directly influence the volume of natural gas and electricity sold and delivered. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the winter months, when natural gas and electricity are used for heating. For electricity, customer demand also increases during the summer months, when electricity is used for cooling. We measure the relative impact of weather by using a degree-day methodology accepted by the utility industry. Degree-day data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day’s average temperature. Normal heating and cooling degree-days are based on the most recent 10-year average. 
Our Maryland division’s rates include a weather normalization adjustment for residential heating and smaller commercial heating customers. A weather normalization adjustment is a billing adjustment mechanism (or "decoupled" rate mechanism) that is designed to eliminate the effect of deviations from average seasonal temperatures on utility net revenues. In 2016, Sandpiper received approval from the Maryland PSC to include in its rates a weather normalization adjustment for residential heating and smaller commercial heating customers. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 18, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities, in the consolidated financial statements) for more information. 
We do not currently have any weather normalization or “decoupled” rate mechanisms for our other local distribution utilities.

(1) The effective date of the order approving the settlement agreement, which adjusted the rates originally approved on June 4, 2009. 
(2) We filed base rate proceedings for Eastern Shore on January 27, 2017. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 18, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities, in the consolidated financial statements) for more information.
(3) Allowed after-tax return on equity.
(4) The terms of the settlement agreement for the FPU electric division rate case with the Florida PSC prescribed an authorized return on equity range of 9.25 to 11.25 percent, with a mid-point of 10.25 percent. The FPU electric division was not allowed to file for a base rate increase prior to December 2016, unless its allowed return on equity fell below the authorized range. If the allowed return on equity exceeded the authorized range, the Office of the Public Counsel could seek a rate decrease.
(5) Allowed pre-tax, pre-interest rate of return.
(6) The terms of the agreement include revenue neutral rates for the first year, followed by a schedule of rate reductions in subsequent years based upon the projected rate of propane to natural gas conversions.
In addition to the base rates approved by the PSCs, certain of our local distribution utilities have additional surcharge mechanisms which were separately approved by their respective PSC. The most notable surcharge mechanisms include Delaware’s surcharge to increase the availability of natural gas in portions of eastern Sussex County, Delaware; Maryland's surcharge designed to recover the costs associated with conversions to natural gas and to improve infrastructure in Worcester County, Maryland; and Florida’s GRIP surcharge designed to recover capital and other costs, inclusive of an appropriate return on investment, associated with accelerating the replacement of qualifying distribution mains.
In February, 2017, FPU’s electric division filed a petition with the Florida PSC, requesting a temporary surcharge mechanism to recover costs, inclusive of an appropriate return on investment, associated with an essential reliability and modernization project on its electric distribution system. We are seeking approval to invest approximately $59.8 million, over a five-year period associated with this project. In February, 2017, the Office of Public Counsel intervened in this petition. The outcome of our petition is not known at this time.
See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 18, Rates and Other Regulatory Activities in the consolidated financial statements) for more information.
Competition
Our natural gas and electric distribution operations and our natural gas transmission operations compete with other forms of energy, including oil, propane and other sources of energy. The principal competitive factors are price and, to a lesser extent, accessibility. Our natural gas distribution operations have several large industrial customers that are able to use fuel oil or propane as an alternative to natural gas. When oil or propane prices decline, these interruptible customers may convert to an alternative fuel source to satisfy their fuel requirements and our sales volumes may decline. To address the uncertainty of alternative fuel prices, we use flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of our business to compete with alternative fuel price fluctuations. 
Large industrial natural gas customers may be able to bypass our distribution and transmission systems and make direct connections with “upstream” interstate transmission pipelines when such connections are economically feasible. Certain large industrial electric customers may be capable of generating electricity for their own consumption. Although the risk of bypassing our systems is not considered significant, we may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business in certain situations. 
Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2016 Form 10-K Page  6

Supplies, Transmission and Storage
Our Delaware and Maryland divisions use their firm transportation resources, summarized in the table below, to meet a significant percentage of their projected demand requirements. They purchase firm natural gas supplies to meet those projected requirements with purchases of base load, daily spot supplies and storage service. They have both firm and interruptible transportation service contracts with four interstate “open access” pipeline companies (Eastern Shore, Transco, Columbia Gas and TETLP) in order to meet customer demand. Their distribution system is directly interconnected with Eastern Shore’s pipeline, which is directly interconnected with the upstream pipelines of Transco, Columbia Gas and TETLP.

 | | Maximum Daily Firm Transportation Capacity (Dts) | Contract Expiration Date
Division | Counterparty | 
Delaware | Eastern Shore | 73,779 | 2017 - 2028 
 | Columbia Gas | 10,960 | 2017 - 2020 
 | Transco | 21,423 | 2017 - 2028 
 | TETLP | 34,100 | 2027 
Maryland | Eastern Shore | 26,673 | 2017 - 2027 
 | Columbia Gas | 4,200 | 2017 - 2019 
 | Transco | 6,188 | 2017 - 2019 
 | TETLP | 15,900 | 2027 

The Delaware and Maryland divisions also have the capability to use propane-air and liquefied natural gas peak-shaving equipment to supplement or displace natural gas purchases. 
Our Delaware and Maryland divisions contract with an unaffiliated energy marketing and risk management company through an asset management agreement to optimize their transportation and storage capacity and secure an adequate supply of natural gas. Pursuant to the asset management agreement, the asset manager pays our divisions a fee, which our divisions share with their customers. The current asset management agreement expires in March 2017. Our Delaware and Maryland divisions are currently negotiating an asset management agreement with PESCO and anticipate executing a three-year agreement by the end of the first quarter of 2017. The Delaware PSC has approved PESCO serving as Asset Manager.
Sandpiper is a party to a capacity, supply and operating agreement with EGWIC to purchase propane, with a contract ending in May 2019. Sandpiper's current annual commitment is estimated at approximately 3.4 million gallons. Sandpiper has the option to enter into either a fixed per-gallon price for some or all of the propane purchases or a market-based price utilizing one of two local propane pricing indices. Sandpiper also has 2,450 Dts of maximum daily firm transportation capacity available from Eastern Shore through contracts expiring on various dates between 2017 and 2027. 
Our Florida division has a firm transportation service agreement with Gulfstream for firm transportation capacity of 10,000 Dts/d until May 2022. Pursuant to a program approved by the Florida PSC, the capacity under this agreement has been released to various third parties, including PESCO. Under the terms of these capacity release agreements, we are contingently liable to Gulfstream if any party that acquired the capacity through release fails to pay the capacity charge.
FPU has firm transportation service agreements with FGT, Florida City Gas and Peninsula Pipeline, ranging from 56,455 to 97,277 Dts/d. These agreements expire on various dates between 2017 and 2035. FPU uses gas marketers and producers to procure all of its gas supplies to meet projected requirements. FPU also uses Peoples Gas to provide wholesale gas sales service in areas far from FPU's interconnections with FGT.
Eastern Shore has three agreements with Transco for a total of 7,292 Dts/d of firm daily storage injection and withdrawal entitlements and total storage capacity of 288,003 Dts. These agreements expire on various dates between 2018 and 2023. Eastern Shore retains these firm storage services in order to provide swing transportation service and firm storage service to customers requesting such services. 
FPU currently purchases its wholesale electricity primarily from two suppliers, JEA and Gulf Power, under full requirements contracts expiring in December 2017 and 2019, respectively. The JEA contract provides generation and transmission service to northeast Florida. The Gulf Power contract provides generation and transmission service to northwest Florida. FPU has a renewable energy purchase agreement with Rayonier to purchase between 1.7 MWH and 3.0 MWH of electricity annually through 2036. FPU also has an agreement to purchase up to 20 MWH of electricity from its affiliate, Eight Flags. The electricity purchased from Rayonier and Eight Flags serves a portion of FPU's electric distribution customers' base load in northeast Florida.

UNREGULATED ENERGY
Our Unregulated Energy segment provides: (i) propane distribution; (ii) propane and crude oil wholesale marketing; (iii) natural gas marketing; (iv) unregulated natural gas supply, gathering and processing; (v) electricity and steam generation; and (vi) other unregulated energy-related services to customers. Revenues generated from this segment are not subject to any federal, state or local pricing regulations. Our businesses in this segment typically complement our regulated energy businesses based on the products and services they sell.
Propane Distribution 
Our propane distribution operations sell propane primarily to residential, commercial/industrial and wholesale customers in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and southeastern Pennsylvania, through Sharp and Sharpgas, and in Florida through FPU and Flo-gas. Many of our propane distribution customers are “bulk delivery” customers. We make deliveries of propane to the bulk delivery customers as needed, based on the level of propane remaining in the tank located at the customer’s premises. We invoice and record revenues for our bulk delivery service customers at the time of delivery, rather than upon customers’ actual usage, since the customers typically own the propane gas in the tanks on their premises. We also have underground propane distribution systems serving various neighborhoods and communities. Such customers are billed monthly based on actual consumption, which is measured by meters installed on their premises. In Florida, we also offer metered propane distribution service to residential and commercial customers. We read the meters on such customers' tanks and bill the customers once a month.
Propane Distribution - Operational Highlights
For the year ended December 31, 2016, operating revenues, volumes sold and average number of customers by customer class for our Delmarva Peninsula and Pennsylvania and Florida propane distribution operations were as follows:

Propane Distribution - Competition
We compete with several other propane distributors in our geographic markets, primarily on the basis of price and service. Our competitors generally include local outlets of national distributors and local independent distributors, whose proximity to customers entails lower costs to provide service. As an energy source, propane competes with home heating oil and electricity, which are typically more expensive (based on equivalent unit of heat value). Since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane, propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas served by natural gas pipelines or distribution systems.
Propane Distribution - Supplies, Transportation and Storage
We purchase propane for our propane distribution operations primarily from suppliers, including major oil companies, and independent producers of natural gas liquids. Although supplies of propane from these and other sources are generally readily available for purchase, extreme market conditions, such as significant fluctuations in weather, closing of refineries and disruption in supply chains, could result in a reduction in available supplies.
Propane is transported by trucks and railroad cars from refineries, natural gas processing plants or pipeline terminals to bulk propane storage facilities that we own in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida. These bulk storage facilities have an aggregate capacity of approximately 6.2 million gallons. We then deliver propane from these storage facilities by truck to tanks located on our customers’ premises.
Propane Distribution Weather
Revenues from our propane distribution sales activities are affected by seasonal variations in temperature and weather conditions. Weather conditions and their severity directly influence the volume of propane used by our metered customers or sold and delivered to our bulk customers, with demand increasing substantially during the winter months when propane is used for heating. Sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to reduce propane use, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to increase consumption.
Propane and Crude Oil Wholesale Marketing
Xeron trades in short-term natural gas liquids and crude oil forward and futures contracts on the InterContinentalExchange, Inc. Xeron settles its purchases and sales financially, without taking physical delivery of the propane or crude oil. The level and profitability of the propane and crude oil wholesale trading activity are affected by both propane and crude oil wholesale price volatility and liquidity in the wholesale market. At December 31, 2016, Xeron did not have any open futures or forward contracts.
Natural Gas Marketing
We provide natural gas supply and supply management services through PESCO to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers. PESCO operates primarily in Florida, on the Delmarva Peninsula, and in Ohio. In 2016, PESCO had operating revenues of $58.0 million in Florida, $15.7 million from customers located on the Delmarva Peninsula, $9.8 million from customers located in Ohio, and $11.9 million from customers located in other states. PESCO competes with regulated utilities and other unregulated third-party marketers to sell natural gas supplies directly to commercial and industrial customers through competitively-priced contracts. PESCO does not currently own or operate any natural gas transmission or distribution assets. The gas that PESCO sells is delivered to retail or wholesale customers through affiliated and non-affiliated local distribution company systems and transmission pipelines. PESCO bills its customers directly or through the billing services of the regulated utilities that deliver the gas. PESCO is currently negotiating an asset management agreement with our Delaware and Maryland divisions and anticipates executing a three-year agreement by the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
In January 2016, PESCO entered into a SCO supplier agreement with Columbia Gas of Ohio to provide natural gas supply for one of its local distribution customer pools. PESCO also assumed the obligation to store natural gas inventory to satisfy its obligations under the SCO supplier agreement, which terminates on March 31, 2017. 
In conjunction with the SCO supplier agreement, PESCO entered into natural gas futures contracts during the second quarter of 2016 in order to protect its natural gas inventory against market price fluctuations. The contracts expire in March 31, 2017. We initially accounted for these contracts as fair value hedges with any ineffective portion being reported directly in earnings and offset by any associated gain (loss) on the inventory value being hedged. During the third quarter of 2016, we de-designated the hedges as they were no longer deemed to be highly effective. We are now accounting for them as derivatives on a mark-to-market basis, with the change in fair value reflected as unrealized gain (loss) in current period earnings, and these are no longer offset by any associated gain (loss) in the value of the inventory previously hedged.

Unregulated Natural Gas Infrastructure Services 
Aspire Energy is an unregulated natural gas infrastructure company that owns approximately 2,600 miles of pipeline systems in 40 counties throughout Ohio. The majority of Aspire Energy’s margin is derived from long-term supply agreements with Columbia Gas of Ohio and CGC, which together serve more than 20,000 end-use customers. Aspire Energy primarily sources gas from 300 conventional producers and also provides gathering and processing services so that it can maintain quality and reliability for its wholesale markets. 
For the twelve-months period ended December 31, 2016, Aspire Energy's operating revenues and deliveries by customer type were as follows:

 | Operating revenues | | Deliveries
 | (in thousands) | | (in Dts) 
Supply to Columbia Gas of Ohio | $ | 9,429 | | | 2,197
Supply to CGC | 8,037 | | | 1,238 |

Eight Flags 
Eight Flags provides electricity and steam generation services through its CHP plant located on Amelia Island, Florida. The construction of the CHP plant was completed in June 2016. The CHP plant, which consists of a natural-gas-fired turbine and associated electric generator, produces approximately 20 MWH of base load power and includes a heat recovery steam generator capable of providing approximately 75,000 pounds per hour of residual steam. In June 2016, Eight Flags began selling power generated from the CHP plant to FPU pursuant to a 20-year power purchase agreement for distribution to its retail electric customers. In July 2016, it also started selling steam to Rayonier pursuant to a separate 20-year contract. The CHP plant is powered by natural gas transported by FPU through its distribution system. During the second half of 2016, Eight Flags generated $7.0 million in operating revenues from the sale of electricity to FPU and $1.3 million from the sale of steam to Rayonier.
