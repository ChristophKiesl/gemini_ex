Overview
Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. was incorporated on May 24, 1999 in the state of Delaware and began its principal operations in November 1999. Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Cornerstone,” “we,” “Company,” “us” and “our” refer to Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Cornerstone is a leading global provider of learning and people development solutions, delivered as software-as-a-service (“SaaS”).We were founded with a passion for empowering people through learning and a conviction that people should be an organization’s greatest competitive advantage. We believe people can achieve anything when they have the right development and growth opportunities. We offer organizations the technology, content, expertise, and specialized focus to help them realize their potential.

We work with customers across all geographies, vertical markets, and market segments. Our customers include multi-national corporations, large domestic and foreign-based enterprises, mid-market companies, public sector organizations, healthcare providers, higher education institutions, non-profit organizations, and small businesses. We sell our solution domestically and internationally through both direct and indirect channels, including direct sales teams throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific and distributor relationships with payroll companies, human resource consultancies, and global system integrators.
Our enterprise people development solution is composed of four product suites:

• | Our Recruiting suite helps organizations to attract, hire, and onboard the right employees;

Cornerstone Learning comprehensively supports compliance, knowledge sharing, and employee-driven development training to close skills gaps.

The Market
The human capital management (“HCM”) technology market is one of the largest in the software industry. According to an International Data Corporation (“IDC”) market forecast report, titled “Worldwide Human Capital Management and Payroll Applications Forecast, 2018-2022,” published in June 2018, the global market for Human Capital Management and Payroll Applications in 2018 was predicted to be $21.1 billion, of which $16.0 billion is for HCM applications. According to IDC, the HCM and payroll application market is expected to grow to $30.5 billion by 2022, representing a 9.6% CAGR, and includes payroll, HR, talent acquisition, workforce management, document management, performance management, compensation management, and succession planning. 
The global corporate training market is also one of the largest in the software industry. According to a Training Industry, Inc. report, titled “The Anatomy of the Modern Learning System,” global spend on corporate training initiatives was estimated to be $366.0 billion in 2018, of which approximately $66.0 billion was spent on third-party external training courses and tuition reimbursement in North America. 
Our People Development Solution
Our people development solution is a comprehensive SaaS solution that consists of four integrated suites to help organizations manage their recruiting, learning, performance, and HR administration processes. These suites are supplemented by state-of-the-art analytics and reporting as well as a number of cross-product tools for employee profile management and e-learning content aggregation and delivery. We believe that our people development solution delivers the following benefits:

• | Comprehensive Functionality. Our solution provides a comprehensive approach to people development by offering products to address all stages of the employee lifecycle: recruiting, onboarding, learning, performance, succession, compensation, enterprise social collaboration, and HR administration processes. Employees use our solution throughout their careers to engage in performance processes such as goal management, performance reviews, continuous feedback, competency assessments, and compensatory reviews; to complete job-specific and compliance-related training; to evaluate potential career changes, development plans or succession processes; and to connect and collaborate with co-workers by leveraging enterprise social networking tools. Employee managers and HR managers use our solution to perform their people development administrative responsibilities effectively throughout their employees’ careers. We believe our comprehensive, unified solution enables our customers to align their people development processes and practices with their broader strategic goals.


• | Flexible and Highly Configurable. Our solution offers substantial configurability that allows our customers to match the use of our software with their specific business processes and workflows. We also provide web services to facilitate the importing and exporting of data to and from other customer systems, such as enterprise resource planning and human resource information system solutions. Our customers can configure various features, functions and work flows in our solution by business unit, division, department, region, location, job position, pay grade, cost center, or self-defined organizational unit. Our customers are able to adjust features to configure specific processes, such as performance review workflows or training approvals, to match their existing or desired practices. This high level of configurability means that custom coding projects generally are not required to meet the diverse needs of our customers.


• | Easy-to-Use, Personalized User Interface. Our solution employs an intuitive user interface and may be personalized for the end user, typically based on position, division, pay grade, location, manager and particular use of the solution. This ease of use limits the need for end-user training, which we believe increases user adoption rates and usage.


• | Software-as-a-Service Solution Lowers the Total Cost of Ownership and Speeds Delivery. Our solution is accessible through a standard web browser and does not require the large investments in implementation time, personnel, hardware, and consulting that are typical of hosted or on-premise solutions. With a single code base to maintain, we are able to release improved functionality on a quarterly basis. This is a more rapid pace than most hosted or on-premise solution providers can afford to deliver.


• | Scalable to Meet the Needs of Organizations. Our solution has been used by Fortune 100 companies since 2001. While the complex needs of these global corporations required us to build a solution that can scale to support large, geographically-distributed employee bases, our solution is capable of supporting deployments of various sizes.


• | Insights and Predictive Analysis. Our solution leverages technology powered by a highly refined machine learning system for people development. We also offer a large network of shared talent data. This enables leaders to answer critical questions about how to better hire, manage, retain, and reward talent with dashboards that can be drilled down to individual employees. Enhanced by additional Cornerstone suite usage, these insights allow organizations to manage their people development process proactively and be strategic with initiatives that affect thousands of employees across many groups and locations.


• | Continued Innovation through Collaborative Product Development. We work collaboratively with our customers on an ongoing basis to develop almost every part of our solution. The vast majority of our thousands of software features were designed using feedback from existing and prospective customers based on their specific functional requests.


• | Focus on Data Privacy and Security. We have designed our solution to meet certain rigorous industry and jurisdictional security standards and to help assure customers that their sensitive data is protected across the system. We use commercially reasonable methods and technology designed to ensure high levels of security by logically segregating each customer’s data from the data of other customers and by enforcing a consistent approach to roles and rights within the system. These restrictions limit system access to only those individuals authorized by our customers. We also employ multiple standard technologies, protocols and processes to monitor, test and certify the security of our infrastructure continuously.

Our People Development Solutions
Our comprehensive people development solution is a collection of four integrated suites to help organizations manage key phases of the employee life cycle. To complement our solution, we offer a number of cross-product tools for analytics and reporting, employee profile management, and e-learning content aggregation. 
Cornerstone Learning 
Cornerstone Learning. Our Learning product helps customers deliver mobile-ready, enterprise-class training, and development programs. It links employee development to other parts of the talent management lifecycle, including onboarding, performance management, and succession planning. The Learning product supports all forms of learning, including online, instructor-led and collaborative on-the-job learning, as well as robust reporting and embedded predictive analytics. With tens of thousands of online training titles from dozens of global content providers accessible through our new engaging learning experience solution, customers reduce overall training expenses, while quickly transforming their learning programs with modern, curated content. The access to personalized content delivered at scale with Cornerstone’s machine learning technology builds a culture of continuous learning, boosting employee engagement and retention.
Cornerstone Extended Enterprise. Our extended enterprise product helps customers provide training and enablement to their customers, vendors, and distributors. The extended enterprise product empowers customers to develop new profit centers, increase sales, cut support costs and boost channel productivity. 
Cornerstone for Salesforce. Our Cornerstone for Salesforce product is an enablement solution for employees, partners, and customers which leverages customers’ Salesforce investments across all products to build high-performance sales and service teams with triggered, just-in-time training.
Cornerstone Content. Our Cornerstone Content solutions enable organizations to deliver fresh, modern content to their workforce. We have entered into license agreements with a wide range of vendors that provide off-the-shelf e-learning content and custom learning content development services. Through this network, we offer an extensive library of online training content to our customers through our Learning Experience solution. Content Anytime is our proprietary, foundational e-learning content subscription which integrates seamlessly into Cornerstone Learning. The subscription provides access to pre-curated packages around a variety of popular topics. We plan to expand our Content Anytime offering as part of our strategic initiative to grow our content sales.
Cornerstone Performance 
Cornerstone Performance. Our performance management product allows customers to direct and measure performance at the individual, departmental, and organizational levels through ongoing competency management, organizational goal setting, performance appraisal, development planning, and feedback. Performance data can also be used by the Learning product offering to set training priorities and to make informed workforce planning decisions. 
Cornerstone Succession. Our succession product allows customers to proactively plan for organizational change and talent mobility. The succession product serves both the employee looking for career advancement and management team members planning for the future. Employees can share career preferences and discover development opportunities. Management team members can utilize tools provided to identify skill gaps, implement development plans, and create talent pools for future needs.
Cornerstone Compensation. Our compensation product allows customers to reward their employees for hard work in direct relation to performance. The compensation product enables customers to make more informed decisions about the allocation of base pay, bonus and equity awards. 
Cornerstone Recruiting 
Cornerstone Recruiting. Our applicant tracking product supports the modern ways that organizations attract and hire new employees. From easily tracking applicants through the hiring process, to managing interviews and tracking feedback, our solution simplifies processes to save recruiters and hiring managers time. With mobile-friendly, customizable career sites, organizations can showcase their unique employer brand to attract top talent.
Cornerstone Onboarding. Our onboarding product enables customers to tailor resources based on a new hire’s specific position, avoiding wasted effort and enabling new hires to focus on meaningful activities that accelerate productivity. The product helps new employees acclimate quickly by providing a personalized, modern, onboarding experience that equips them with the right resources. The onboarding product complements the recruiting product by providing a seamless and engaging experience for the employee, while reducing administrative burden and promoting collaboration across departments. 
Cornerstone HR 
Cornerstone HR. Our HR product offers a modern interface for centralized HR administration across an organization’s disparate systems. Acting as a source of truth for core employee and talent data, the system supports employee self-service, absence management, organization management, and records administration. 
Cornerstone View. Our view product allows customers to access HR data across our people development products. The view product enables organizations to utilize interactive data visualization tools to discover their top performers and future leaders, proactively answer workforce questions, and achieve business results.
Cornerstone Benchmark. Our benchmark product enables organizations to compare internal employee data with peers in external companies or across divisions, subdivisions, subsidiaries, or regions within their own organization. Both options allow the organization to visualize how they compare against custom and internal business segments across a variety of metrics.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to empower people, organizations, and communities to realize their potential with a comprehensive people development solution that is built to last. Our growth strategy since inception has been deliberate and focused on long-term success. This has allowed us to weather periods of economic turmoil and significant changes in the markets we serve without experiencing business contraction. We plan to continue with the same systematic approach in the future. Key elements of our strategy include:
Continue to Innovate and Extend Our Technological Leadership. We believe we have developed over the last 20 years a deep understanding of the people development challenges our customers face. We continually collaborate with our customers to build extensive functionality that addresses their specific needs and requests. We plan to continue to leverage our expertise in people development and customer relationships to develop new products, features, and functionality that will enhance our solutions and expand our addressable market. We plan to continue our policy of implementing best practices across our organization, expanding our technical operations, and investing in our network infrastructure and service capabilities in order to support continued future growth. 
Retain and Expand Business with Existing Customers. We believe our existing installed base of customers offers a substantial opportunity for growth.

• | Focus on Customer Success, Retention, and Growth. We believe focusing on our customers’ success will lead to our own success. We have developed a Customer Success Framework that governs our operating model. Since 2002, we have averaged annual gross dollar retention rates of approximately 95%. At the same time, in recent years, we have seen a decline in our annual gross dollar retention rate, which was 90% in the most recent period. We strive to maintain our strong retention rates by continuing to provide our customers with high levels of service, support, and increasing functionality.


• | Sell Additional Products to Existing Customers. We believe there is a significant growth opportunity in selling additional functionality to our existing customers. Many customers have added functionality subsequent to their initial deployments as they recognize the benefits of our unified solution. With our expanding product portfolio functionality, we believe significant upsell opportunity remains within our existing customer base.

Focus on Growing Recurring Revenue. In 2018, we refined our go-to-market strategy to drive enhanced recurring revenue growth. We believe our primary growth drivers are as follows: 

• | Invest in Direct Sales in North America. We believe that the market for people development is large and remains significantly underpenetrated. In particular, content and recruiting provide an opportunity to increase our recurring sales to both new and existing customers. Additionally, we believe the small and medium-sized business (“SMB”) market represents a very large and underpenetrated opportunity.


• | Continue to Invest in Our International Operations. We believe a substantial opportunity exists to continue to grow sales of our solution internationally. We intend to grow our Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific and Japan (“APJ”) operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 900 customers in EMEA and over 200 customers in APJ.


• | Grow Our Cornerstone Content Anytime Sales. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for developing employees throughout their careers with modern, fresh e-learning content. Our Content Anytime subscription offering provides access to industry leading content which we believe will increase user engagement on our solution. Our content partners for Content Anytime include industry leaders as well as regional, functional and vertically-focused online training providers. In addition, we have agreements with providers of specific competency models for use by our customers directly in our people development solution. We intend to enter into additional license agreements to continue providing the best content available for our customers.


• | Expand the Ecosystem. During 2018, we migrated a sizable portion of our implementation services to our partners. We have also expanded in recent years our relationships with various third-party consulting firms to deliver the successful implementation of our solution and to optimize our customers’ use of our solution during the terms of their engagements. Our partner strategy and experience includes certifications and curricula developed to ensure successful delivery by our partners and continued high customer satisfaction. We believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage these third-parties interested in building or expanding their businesses to increase our market penetration.

Increase Operating Income and Free Cash Flow. In 2017, we announced a strategic plan designed to better position us for long-term growth and increase shareholder value. As part of this plan, we have increased our focus on managing our costs while making smart investments to scale our middle and back-office operations, which we believe will support growth in recurring revenue and our long-term success over time. We have executed and intend to continue to execute operational excellence initiatives to optimize our margin profile, which we believe will enable further leverage in our expense structure and growth in operating income and free cash flow.
Acquisitions and Strategic Investments. We may acquire or invest in additional businesses, products or technologies that we believe will complement or expand our solution, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Most recently, in February 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Saba, a provider of talent experience solutions, which acquisition remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review. In January 2020, we acquired Clustree, a developer of a skills engine and skills ontology. In December 2019, we invested in Talespin Inc. (“Talespin”), a developer of enterprise virtual reality training software. In November 2018, we acquired Grovo Learning, Inc. (“Grovo”), a provider of Microlearning® content. In September 2018, we acquired Workpop Inc. (“Workpop”), a web and mobile solution for candidates and hiring managers in service-based industries. Clustree was acquired to accelerate the development of a skills engine. Grovo was acquired to enhance our Content product and Workpop was acquired to enhance our Recruiting product.
For additional information regarding our anticipated acquisition of Saba, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Global Customer Success
We are dedicated to the success of our customers. We have developed a Customer Success Framework, which governs our operational model, the structure of our customer management teams and the types of services necessary at each stage of a customer’s lifecycle.
Within this framework, we have developed the following roles with primary responsibility to our customers at various levels of their organizations:

• | Customer executives who interact with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at a customer and are focused on the overall relationship, including sales to existing customers;


• | Customer success managers who work directly with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at our customers to maximize the value of their investment in our people development solution; and


• | Product specialists who interact with customer administrators and are focused on features and functions of our people development solution.

We believe this life cycle driven approach to customer support and customer success has contributed directly to our high customer retention rate and high rankings for customer satisfaction in independent research studies.
We offer support in multiple languages, at multiple levels and through multiple channels, including global support coverage available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We use our own enterprise social collaboration product to provide our customers and distributors with a virtual community to collaborate on product design, release management and best practices.
We monitor customer satisfaction internally as part of formalized programs and at regular intervals during the customer lifecycle, including during the transition from sales to implementation, at the completion of a consulting project and daily based on interactions with our customer-facing teams.
Technology, Operations and Research and Development
Our people development solution is designed and deployed with an on-demand, multi-tenant, and multi-user architecture which our customers access via a standard web browser. It currently uses a single code base, with all of our customers running on the current version of our software. We employ a modularized architecture to balance the load of customers on separate sub-environments, as well as to provide a flexible method for scalability without impacting other parts of the current environment. This architecture allows us to provide the high levels of uptime required by our customers. Our existing infrastructure has been designed with sufficient capacity to meet our current and estimated near term future needs. Global uptime in 2019 was 99.989%.
We physically host our solution for our customers in secure third-party data center facilities located in the US, the United Kingdom (“UK”), France, and Germany. These facilities provide physical security, including biometric access controls and systems security, redundant power and environmental controls. 
We are continuing to build out services and functionality in the public cloud with a view to migrating more software to the public cloud over time. This strategy provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and scale our deployment capabilities as we continue moving from a monolithic to a microservices architecture. We maintain the same or higher standards of security and compliance with our public cloud providers as we do in our leased facilities.
Our ability to compete depends largely on our continuous commitment to product development and ability to rapidly introduce new products, technologies, features, and functionality. The responsibilities of our research and development organization include product management, product development, quality assurance, IT security, and technology operations. Our research and development organization is global, with major engineering centers in the US, Israel, New Zealand, and India. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell our software, content, and services both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our domestic and international network of distributors. We currently service customers in a wide range of industries, including, among others business services, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, insurance, manufacturing, retail, and high technology. We have a number of direct sales teams organized by market segment, industry vertical, and geographic regions such as the Americas, EMEA, and APJ. 
Our direct sales team is supported by product specialists who provide technical and product expertise to facilitate the sales process. Our sales enablement professionals provide on-boarding and ongoing professional development for the sales professionals to increase their effectiveness at selling in the field. We also maintain a separate team of customer executives responsible for renewals and upsells to existing customers.
Marketing
We manage global demand generation programs, develop sales pipelines, and enhance brand awareness through our marketing initiatives. Our marketing programs target HR executives, technology professionals, and senior business leaders. Our principal marketing initiatives include:

• | Demand Generation. Our demand generation activities include targeted account-based marketing, lead generation through email and direct mail campaigns, participation in industry events, securing event speaking opportunities, and online marketing, including both search engine marketing and organic search engine optimization online marketing.


• | Corporate Marketing. We market to our customers by leveraging product marketing, customer success stories, thought leadership content and brand awareness advertising campaigns. Additionally, we host product advisory communities and executive advisory councils; we also co-market with our strategic distributors, including joint press announcements and demand generation activities.


• | Marketing Communications. We undertake media relations, corporate communications, industry analyst relations activities, customer advocacy, and social media outreach.

Competition
The market for people development software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented. This market is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Most of our sales efforts are competitive, often involving requests for proposals. We compete primarily on the basis of providing a highly configurable, comprehensive, fully unified solution for people development as opposed to specific service offerings.
In the applicant tracking systems segment, which our Recruiting suite offerings serve, our principal competitors include companies such as IBM Kenexa, iCIMS, Oracle Corporation (Taleo), Saba (Lumesse), and SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors). In the learning management systems segment, which our Learning suite offerings each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Learning Technologies Group plc (PeopleFluent), Oracle Corporation, Saba, SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors), SkillSoft Limited (SumTotal), Ultimate Software Group, Inc., and Workday, Inc. In the performance management systems segment, which our Performance suite offerings each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, Saba (Halogen), SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors), Talentsoft SA, and Workday, Inc. These vendors are, like us, largely SaaS providers. We compete in these segments primarily on the basis of:

• | the level of integration of our product offerings within our people development solution;


• | the breadth and depth of our product functionality;


• | the flexibility and configurability of our product offerings to meet the changing content and workflow requirements of our customers’ business units;


• | the quality of our service and focus on customer success;


• | our ability to provide scalability and flexibility for large and complex global deployments; and


• | the ease of use of our product offerings and overall user experience.

In addition, we occasionally compete with custom-built software that is designed to support the needs of a single organization, as well as with third-party talent and human resource application providers that focus on specific aspects of people development.
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets than we do. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.”
Proprietary Rights
To safeguard our proprietary and intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws in the US and in other jurisdictions and on contractual restrictions. We have confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, customers, distributors, and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information and software.
Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees, creation of new suites, features and functionality, collaboration with our customers and frequent enhancements to our solution are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Government Contracts
Many of our contracts with government agencies are subject to termination at the election of the government agency. While our government contracts generally do not provide for renegotiation of fees at the election of the government, it is possible that the government agency could request, and that we could under certain circumstances agree to, the renegotiation of the payments otherwise payable under such contracts. However, we have not in the past renegotiated significant payment terms under our government contracts. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks.”
Seasonality
Our sales are seasonal in nature. We sign a higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. In addition, within a given quarter, we sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of that quarter. Our agreements generally come up for renewal at the same time of the year they were originally signed, which further amplifies the seasonal nature of our sales.
We believe this seasonality is driven by several factors, most notably the tendency of our customers’ procurement departments to purchase technology at the end of a quarter or calendar year, possibly in order to use up their available quarterly or annual funding allocations. 
Employees
At December 31, 2019, we had nearly 2,000 employees. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be strong. 
The Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation
To demonstrate our commitment to empowering people and communities, we helped form the Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation (the “Foundation”) in 2010. The Foundation seeks to empower communities in the US and internationally by increasing the impact of the non-profit sector through the utilization of our people development solutions and capacity building programs.
The Foundation focuses its efforts on the areas of education, workforce development and disaster relief. We have enlisted the help of our employees, customers, and distributors to support the Foundation in its efforts. The Foundation is designed to be self-sustaining over time through a variety of ongoing funding streams, such as donations, sponsorships, and distribution fees.
