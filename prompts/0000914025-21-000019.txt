MARKET INFORMATION 
General Industry Background

Poly operates predominantly in the unified communications industry and focuses on the design, manufacture, and distribution of headsets, voice, video, and content sharing solutions, as well as a comprehensive line of support and service solutions to ensure customer success. We develop enhanced communication products to work wherever and however work happens: offices, contact centers, and remote work environments, connecting to tools such as open SIP desktop phones, PCs, Macs, and a variety of mobile devices. We offer our products and services under the , Plantronics and Polycom brands. 
We believe the end market for professional-grade communications equipment is no longer “home” or “office.” It is “anywhere” and “everywhere,” as the digital transformation of the enterprise continues, creating a corresponding increase in the volume and sophistication of communications requirements, especially high-quality video and audio. Existing trends toward remote and hybrid work and the increasing adoption of video communications have dramatically accelerated, and the number of communications usage scenarios and product needs have permanently multiplied:
•The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a critical catalyst to change working habits, worldwide, and acted as a massive accelerant to the digital transformation already reshaping the working world. 
•We believe this shift will be permanent. Gartner research estimates that “by 2024, remote workers will represent 30% of all employees worldwide… to number nearly 600 million.” Similarly, Frost & Sullivan analysis suggests post-pandemic, the number of remote workers will be six times greater, creating a massive demand for meeting technologies.
•The importance of durable solutions offering high-fidelity connectivity that is easy to use, works anywhere and everywhere, and is compatible with multiple communications platforms, is paramount to our customers.
•Looking ahead, the expansion of both communications applications (e.g., telehealth, government and civil services, education, professional and financial services) and the capabilities of the infrastructure supporting these applications (e.g., 5G network deployments, cloud computing, collaboration software) creates a structural tailwind we believe will create conditions for long-term, sustainable, and durable demand growth for our products.
Table of Contents

•Additionally, the shift to hybrid work models is accelerating the transition of enterprise customers from on-premises to cloud-based call control platforms, which represents a significant market opportunity for Poly.
Our strategy is to offer best-in-class communications gear to meet the needs of customers ranging from the largest companies and governments in the world to individual professionals. Recent product launches and our product roadmap reflect this, as does our marketing and distribution strategy. We believe we are uniquely positioned as the UC&C ecosystem partner of choice through our strategic partnerships, support of open standards, innovative technology, multiple delivery modes, and customer-centric go-to-market capabilities, while at the same time we are establishing the distribution channels necessary to engage customers at the individual level. 
We leverage state-of-the-art technologies in our solutions that can be easily used in conjunction with our strategic partners’ tools and common communication platforms in both personal and enterprise settings. The increased adoption of technologies such as UC&C, Bluetooth, Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”), Digital Signal Processing (“DSP”), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (“DECT”), and Video-as-a-Service (“VaaS”), each of which is described below, has contributed to increased demand for our solutions: 
•UC&C is the integration of voice, data, chat, and video-based communications systems enhanced with software applications and Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It includes more traditional unified communications consisting of on-premise IP telephony, such as e-mail, instant messaging, presence information, audio and video conferencing, and unified messaging; and more modern team collaboration consisting of cloud-based persistent chat and team workspaces, integrated UC and application integrations; as well as browser-based online meetings consisting of integrated audio, video, and web conferencing. UC&C seeks to provide seamless connectivity and user experience for enterprise workers regardless of their location and environment, improving overall business efficiency and providing more effective collaboration among an increasingly distributed workforce.
•Bluetooth wireless technology is a short-range communications protocol intended to replace the cables connecting portable and fixed devices while maintaining high levels of security. The key features of Bluetooth technology are ubiquity, low power, and low cost. The Bluetooth specification defines a uniform structure for a wide range of devices to connect and communicate with each other. Bluetooth standard has achieved global acceptance such that any Bluetooth enabled device, almost anywhere in the world, can connect to other Bluetooth enabled devices in proximity.
•VoIP is a technology that allows a person to communicate using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular (or analog) telephone line. VoIP converts the voice signal into a digital signal that travels over the internet or other packet-switched networks and then converts it back at the other end so that the caller can speak to anyone with another VoIP connection or a regular (or analog) phone line.
•DSP is a technology that delivers acoustic protection and optimal sound quality through noise reduction, echo cancellation, and other algorithms which improve transmission quality.
•DECT is a wireless communications technology that optimizes audio quality, lowers interference with other wireless devices, and digitally encrypts communication for heightened call security.
•VaaS is the delivery of multiparty, or point-to-point, videoconferencing capabilities over an IP network by a managed service provider.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we have a clear understanding of the future of business communications, and we have positioned our company to serve that future: the entirety of our offering, from hardware to software and services, is engineered to meet the communications demands that every enterprise, around the world, will have. We believe the combination of our products and services create the conditions necessary for us to be successful:

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

In Fiscal Years 2021, 2020, and 2019, Total Net Revenues outside the United States of America (U.S.) accounted for approximately 57%, 52%, and 53%, respectively, of our Total Net Revenues.  Total Net Revenues derived from foreign sales are generally subject to additional risks, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, increased tariffs, the imposition of other trade restrictions or barriers, adverse global economic conditions, and potential currency restrictions.  In Fiscal Year 2021, consolidated Total Net Revenues were favorably impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates resulting in an increase of approximately $16.9 million (net of the effects of hedging).
We continue to engage in hedging activities to limit our transaction and economic exposures, and to mitigate our exchange rate risks.  We manage our economic exposure by hedging a portion of our anticipated Euro ("EUR") and British Pound Sterling ("GBP") denominated sales and our Mexican Peso ("MXN") denominated expenditures, which together constitute the most significant portion of our currency exposure.  In addition, we manage our balance sheet exposure by hedging EUR and GBP denominated Cash, Accounts Receivable, and Accounts Payable balances. Excess foreign currencies not required for local operations are converted into U.S. Dollars ("USD"). While our existing hedges cover a certain amount of exposure for Fiscal Year 2022, long-term strengthening of the USD relative to the currencies of other countries in which we sell may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, our results may be adversely impacted by future changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to original hedging contracts, which are generally secured 12 months prior. See further discussion on our business risks associated with foreign operations under the risk titled, "We are exposed to differences and frequent fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our revenues, gross profit, and profitability" within "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Further information regarding our foreign operations, as required by Item 101(d) of Regulation S-K, can be found in Note 20, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information, of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

COMPETITION

We compete broadly in the UC&C market, where we have multiple competitors (depending on the product line) on a global basis. These competitors include Avaya Inc., Aver Information, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., ClearOne Communications, Inc., GN Netcom, Grandstream Networks, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., LifeSize Inc., Logitech International S.A., Neatframe, Inc., Sennheiser Electric Corp., Snom Technology GmbH, Vidyo, Inc., Yamaha Corporation/Revolabs, Inc., Yealink Network Technology Co. Ltd., ZTE Corporation, and others. In some cases, we also cooperate and partner with these companies in programs and various industry initiatives. The market for our products is competitive and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, as well as more substantial production, marketing, engineering, and other capabilities to develop, manufacture, market, and sell their products.

Our strategy of offering a best-in-class complete portfolio of UC&C Headset, Voice and Video endpoints faces challenges from competitors, who create end-to-end service and endpoint solutions, as well as low cost competitors in specific categories, or other industry players, who are potentially able to develop unique technology or compete in a specific geography.
Some of our partners resell our maintenance and support services, while others sell their own branded services. To the extent that channel partners sell their own services, these partners compete with us; however, they typically purchase maintenance contracts from us to support these services. As we expand our professional services offering, we may compete more directly with partners in the future.
We believe the principal factors to be successful and competitive in each of the markets we serve are as follows:
•Understanding emerging trends and new communication technologies, such as UC&C and VaaS, and our ability to react quickly to the opportunities they provide
•Reliable supply chain to meet peak demands
•Alliances and integration/compatibility with major UC&C vendors
•Ability to design, manufacture, and sell products that deliver on performance, style, ease-of-use, comfort, features, sound quality, interoperability, simplicity, price, and reliability
•Ability to create and monetize software solutions that provide management and analytics and allow business to improve IT and employee performance through insights derived from our analytics
•Brand name recognition and reputation
•Superior global customer service, support, and warranty terms
•Global reach, including effective and efficient distribution channels
We believe our products and strategy enable us to compete effectively based on these factors.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

The success of our new products is dependent on several factors, including identifying and designing products that meet anticipated market demand before it has developed and as it matures, timely development, and introduction of these products, cost-effective manufacturing, quality and durability, acceptance of new technologies, and general market acceptance of the products we develop.  See further discussion regarding our business risks associated with our research and development under the risk titled, "We face risks associated with developing and marketing our products, including new product development and new product lines" within "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
We conduct most of our research, development, and engineering with an in-house staff and a limited use of contractors.  
During Fiscal Year 2021, we developed and introduced innovative products that enabled us to better address changing customer demands and emerging market trends.  Our goal is to bring the right products to customers at the right time, utilizing best-in-class development processes.

The products we develop require significant technological knowledge and the ability to rapidly develop the products in intensely competitive and transforming markets. We believe our extensive technological knowledge and portfolio of intellectual property gives us a competitive advantage. We furthermore continually strive to improve the efficiency of our development processes through, among other things, strategic architecting, common platforms, and increased use of software and test tools.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION 

We maintain a worldwide sales force to provide ongoing global customer support and service.  To support our partners in the enterprise market and their customers' needs, we have well-established, two-tiered distribution networks. 
Our global channel network includes enterprise distributors, direct and indirect resellers, retailers, network and systems integrators, service providers, wireless carriers, and mass merchants.  
Our distributors, direct and indirect resellers, system integrators, managed service providers, e-commerce partners, telephony and computer equipment providers resell our commercial headsets, voice, and video endpoint products and related solutions and services. As we evolve into new markets and product categories, we expect to build relationships in new distribution and marketing models.
In addition, we have built a strong foundation of alliance partners, which allow existing and future distribution and reseller partners to sell into Microsoft, Zoom, Google, and other service provider environments. Our commercial distribution channel maintains an inventory of our products.  Our distribution of specialty products includes retail, government programs, customer service, hospitality and healthcare professionals. Poly branded headsets are sold through retailers to corporate customers, small businesses, and individuals who use them for a variety of personal and professional purposes. 
Our commercial distributors and retailers represent our first and second largest sales channels in terms of Total Net Revenues, respectively. Two customers, Ingram Micro Group and ScanSource, accounted for 19.3% and 19.0%, respectively, of Total Net Revenues in Fiscal Year 2021. Two customers, ScanSource and Ingram Micro Group, accounted for 19.8% and 17.3%, respectively, of Total Net Revenues in Fiscal Year 2020. Two customers, ScanSource and Ingram Micro Group, accounted for 16.0% and 11.4%, respectively, of Total Net Revenues in Fiscal Year 2019. 
Some of our products may also be purchased directly from our website at www.poly.com.
We continue to evaluate our logistics processes and implement new strategies to further reduce our transportation costs and improve lead-times to customers. Currently, we have distribution centers in the following locations:
•Tijuana, Mexico, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America regions
•Laem Chabang, Thailand, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Mainland China
•Prague, Czech Republic, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in the Europe, Africa and Middle East regions
•Suzhou, China, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in Mainland China
•San Diego, United States, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in the Americas region
With respect to the above locations, Thailand and the Czech Republic are third-party distribution centers. We operate the distribution centers in Mexico, China and the U.S. 
BACKLOG

We believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business or estimating future performance and results due to the fact that sales of our products typically have relatively short lead-times. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global shelter-in-place orders creating a surge in the number of individuals working from home or from remote locations, we experienced an increase in demand and backlog. However, the backlog of unfulfilled orders is subject to rescheduling and may be subject to cancellation, especially as we manage through supply-chain constraints, including shortages in key components, such as semiconductor chips, and COVID-19.
MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF MATERIALS

Poly relies on our facility in Tijuana, Mexico and various original design and contract manufacturers in Asia to meet our manufacturing needs. 
Table of Contents

We source components for our products primarily from suppliers in Asia, Mexico, and the U.S., including semiconductor chips, electrical and mechanical components, and sub-assemblies. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternate or dual sources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, we do depend on sole sources for certain of our hardware products. 
The combination of our manufacturing and distribution capabilities enables Poly to optimize labor and material costs, adapt to changing trade and tax considerations, strengthen the resilience of our supply chain, and enhance our ability to respond to customer needs. 
For a further discussion of the business risks associated with our manufacturing and sources of materials see the risk titled, “Disruptions in our supply chain, including the inability of our own manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, suppliers and sub-suppliers, to provide and/or timely deliver sufficient quantities of key component parts and/or finished products, has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to fulfill customer demand which, in turn, has and may continue to adversely impact our growth, business, reputation and financial condition” within "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We obtain patent protection for our technologies when we believe it is commercially appropriate.  As of April 3, 2021, we had over 1,900 worldwide utility and design patents in force, expiring between calendar years 2021 and 2046.
We intend to continue seeking patents on our inventions when commercially appropriate. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and preserve other intellectual property rights covering the design and operation of our products.  We own trademark registrations in the U.S. and in a number of other countries, as well as the names of many of our products and product features.  We currently have pending U.S. and foreign trademark applications in connection with our Poly brand name and certain new products and product features, and we may seek copyright protection when and where we believe appropriate.  We also own a number of domain name registrations and intend to seek more, as appropriate.  We furthermore attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through comprehensive security measures, including agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, and suppliers. See further discussion of our business risks associated with intellectual property under the risks titled "Our intellectual property rights could be infringed on by others" and "Patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets are owned by third parties that may make claims or commence litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights" within "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
As a public company with global operations, we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations, which may differ among jurisdictions, include, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, corporate governance, tax, government contracting, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel, import/export, anti-corruption, consumer protection, national security, and environmental regulatory compliance. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted or applied in ways that could limit our business or require us to make certain fundamental and potentially detrimental changes to the products and services we offer. For example, the introduction of new products or services in our existing markets and the expansion of our business to other countries may subject us to additional laws and regulations, among others, resulting from the need to obtain additional licenses and approvals to conduct our businesses as envisioned. The processes by which regulatory approvals are obtained from the U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities to market and sell our products are complex, and may require a number of years, depending upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate, and involve the expenditure of substantial resources for research, development, and testing. Additionally, from time to time, we are also subject to a wide range of reporting requirements, certifications and compliance as prescribed by various federal and state governmental agencies. Expenditures relating to such regulations are made in the normal course of our business and are neither material nor place us at any competitive disadvantage. We do not currently expect that compliance with such laws will require us to make material additional expenditures, however, there is no assurance that existing or future laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products, and services will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
We are subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations 
Table of Contents

generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws or export control, customs, or economic sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties. 
We also are subject to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. We incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products.
We are also subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union. Our customers can use certain of our product offerings that provide product management and analytics, such as Poly Lens, that collect, use, and store certain personally identifiable information (“PII”) regarding a variety of individuals in connection with their operations. National, state, and local governments and agencies in the countries in which we or our customers operate have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer, processing, protection, and disclosure of PII obtained from individuals. Privacy and data protection laws are particularly stringent, and the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws, regulations, and standards, or any alleged or actual violation, may limit the use and adoption of our products and services. Further, complying with privacy laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security have caused and will continue to cause us to incur substantial operational costs and may require us to periodically modify our data handling practices. Moreover, compliance may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, could result in substantial fines or other liability, and may otherwise impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our operations also are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. In addition to environmental and worker safety regulations, we are subject to regulation by numerous other governmental regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Labor and other state, local, and international bodies regulating worker rights and labor conditions. In addition, we are subject to certain requirements to contribute to retirement funds or other benefit plans and laws in some jurisdictions in which we operate restrict our ability to dismiss employees. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.
Also, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to import and export controls. Regulations limiting or banning sales from or into certain countries, including China, or to certain companies, have impacted our ability to transact business. These laws and regulations are complex and may change or develop over time, sometimes with limited notice. We may incur significant expenditures in future periods related to compliance, which could restrict our business operations. For example, we are subject to the regulations of the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions in selling or shipping our products and technology outside the U.S. and to foreign nationals, including tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, sanctions, and other trade barriers, such as U.S. Export Administration regulations and “Entity List” restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. In this regard, the U.S. government recently imposed significant new tariffs on China related to the importation of certain product categories following the U.S. Trade Representative’s Section 301 investigation. In addition, effective June 29, 2020, BIS tightened export controls with respect to goods, software, and technology, including increasing the licensing requirements and due diligence expectations that apply to trade with, China, Russia, and Venezuela, when “military end users” or “military end uses” are involved. This rule expands the scope of the licensing requirement by redefining “military end use” more broadly and by increasing the number of products subject to the restriction. In addition, the White House, the Department of Commerce, and other executive branch agencies have implemented additional restrictions and may implement still further restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. We cannot predict whether these rules and restrictions will be implemented and acted upon by the Biden administration, or modified, overturned, or vacated by legal action. Although we continue to work with our vendors to mitigate our exposure to current or potential tariffs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset any increased costs. 
The trend in environmental regulation has been to impose increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. See "Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters" below for a description of the federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations to which we are subject.

For more information on risks related to the laws and regulations to which we are subject, see the relevant discussions throughout "Item 1A, Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS
We are committed to creating the right kind of long-term impact in the world, not just because it matters to our employees, our customers, and our investors, but because it is part of who we are as a company. We know we are part of a larger global community and make decisions as good stewards of the earth, its resources, and its people.
Fiscal Year 2020 was an important year for us as we developed our new Corporate and Social Responsibility ("CSR") strategy, which focuses on the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues that we believe will positively impact our stakeholders and wider society and drive value for our business. The strategy focuses on three key priorities: delivering low carbon solutions, keeping people safe and secure, and being a destination employer. These three pillars are underpinned by strong governance and supported by our deeply-ingrained culture, values, and behaviors.
Environmental and Climate Change
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those regulations that are administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other regulations governing the use, discharge, and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process. We believe that our current manufacturing and other operations comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are required to comply, and we believe we are currently in compliance, with the European Union and other Directives on the Restrictions of the use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) and on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) requirements. Additionally, we believe we are compliant with the RoHS initiatives in China and Korea; however, it is possible that future environmental legislation may be enacted, or current environmental legislation may be interpreted to create an environmental liability with respect to our facilities, operations, or products. Moreover, in the U.S., our products are regulated by California's Proposition 65, which requires that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to certain chemicals. See further discussion of our business risks associated with environmental legislation under the risk titled, "We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs" within "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We also recognize that climate change is a global emergency that requires urgent action and we may be subject to new and future requirements relating to climate change laws and regulations. Our California corporate offices have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events including wildfires and air quality impacts, power shut-offs associated with wildfire prevention, drought and water scarcity, and warmer temperatures. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense.
Our goal is to deliver absolute emissions reductions across Poly, our products, and for our customers. Our new Low Carbon strategy reflects our commitments to measuring, monitoring, and reducing emissions from both our direct (Scopes 1 and 2) and indirect (Scope 3) operations. In Fiscal Year 2020, we made notable progress in understanding our carbon footprint by implementing a new carbon management software system that enables us to collect, understand, and manage our energy use and operational emissions under our direct control. For the first time, we are reporting on our progress and performance in reducing energy use and operational carbon emissions, which has been third-party verified. We will set energy usage and direct operational emissions reduction targets this year, including a target date and plan for reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions. 
We also are committed to sustainable product design and in Fiscal Year 2020 began life-cycle assessments (LCA’s), which include detailed greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions profiles for each key stage of development on three of our most popular products. We align these assessments to best practice guidelines and standards including PAS 2050:2011, a publicly available specification that provides a recognized method for assessing the life-cycle GHG emissions of products. We use the findings to identify emissions hotspots and improve design where possible.
COVID-19 has been a critical catalyst to changing working habits, and a massive accelerant to the digital transformation already reshaping the working world. It has transformed the way people communicate, dramatically reducing the need for travel in the process. Hundreds of thousands of customers, companies, and institutions around the world use Poly products to come together and collaborate as if they were in the same place. Not only does this save them time and money, but it drastically reduces their impacts on climate change from travel.

Human Capital Management

The future success of our company depends on our ability to attract, hire, motivate, retain, and further develop top talent, including highly-skilled technical, management, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and the salary, benefits, and other costs to employ the right personnel may make it difficult to achieve our financial goals. Consequently, our management team, with the support of our Board of Directors ("Board"), have increased focus and efforts in this area, including efforts to raise our employees' ambitions and inspire them to do more and go further, striving to make Poly an inclusive, diverse, accessible, and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs.
As of April 3, 2021, we employed approximately 8,200 people worldwide, including approximately 4,900 employees at our shared services and manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico. Our employees are based in 39 different countries around the world. Our global work forces consist of diverse, highly skilled talent at all levels. During Fiscal Year 2021, our turnover rate was approximately 21%.
Inclusion, Diversity, Education and Awareness (IDEA) at Poly
We embrace different cultures and perspectives, believing in respect for all human beings. IDEA at Poly is at the very heart of who we are and what we do. We encourage everyone to speak up and constructively challenge and nurture a culture of sensitive curiosity where diverse perspectives are valued and encouraged.
We nurture a culture of allyship and growth mindset and are united by our collective purpose and common set of organizational values that are core to our mission and culture. To do that, our employees must feel empowered to bring their authentic selves to work. We lead with inclusion and empower everyone to do their best work as their best selves, regardless of their sex, gender identity or expression, race, age, religious creed, national origin, physical or mental disability, ancestry, color, marital status, sexual orientation, military or veteran status, status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, medical condition, accessibility needs, genetic information, or any other protected class or category recognized by individual countries laws.
Our employee resource groups (PRIDE, Women’s Leadership Group, Accessibility and Inclusion, Veterans, and Parents & Caregivers) are a critical force within Poly. They tell our story through events and experiences, play a key role in our recruitment strategy, drive an inclusive culture, and ensure that diversity is front and center at Poly.
To help us drive change and make sure the initiatives we create resonate across the globe in every country in which we operate, we created our IDEA Council in Fiscal Year 2021. This global team collaborates to learn, create, strategize, and make sure our diversity and inclusion programs hit the mark with our employees around the world. They are our ambassadors for all things inclusion and diversity and are our agents of change.
We monitor our progress. We are setting aspirational goals for our executives and functions around changing their demographics using data to drive change. Poly has an organization-wide focus to improve recruitment and retention of women and ethnic minorities. As of April 3, 2021, Poly had the following attributes:

 | Female % | Minority % 
Employees | 49% | 33% of U.S. Employees
Executives | 36% | 18% 

We believe in a purposeful culture and encourage our employees to support their passions in the workplace, including their desire to create a healthier planet. Our CSR committee helps to ensure we are doing our part as a company, and we provide our employees with time off to volunteer for causes that are important to them. As a product company, we design our products with environmental benefits in mind.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
 Includes all Tijuana, Mexico employees, approximately 4,400 of which are direct labor/manufacturing line workers.
 Includes voluntary and involuntary terminations, but excludes Tijuana, Mexico direct labor/manufacturing line workers.
 Executives are employees who report directly to the Chief Executive Officer.

The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we continue to invest. These investments and the prioritization of employee health, safety (both physical and psychological), and wellness took on particular significance in Fiscal Year 2021 in light of COVID-19. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. Additionally, we provide programs to help support employee physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, encourage engagement in healthy behaviors, and offer choices where possible so they are customized to meet their needs and the needs of their families.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home whenever possible, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. A number of employees critical to maintaining our essential engineering, manufacturing, repair, and logistics functions have continued to work from Poly locations globally. To protect and support our essential team members, we have implemented health and safety measures that included maximizing personal workspaces, changing shift schedules, providing personal protective equipment (PPE), and instituting mandatory screening before accessing buildings, including enhanced safety measures in our Tijuana manufacturing facility, which included those measures noted above, as well as on-premises medical staff, private bus transportation to and from the facility, routine temperature screenings, and increased sanitation measures. 
Total Rewards
Our team is global, and we offer compelling global incentives to reinforce our performance-driven culture and attract and reward leading talent. We offer global competitive and meaningful total rewards programs that meet the diverse needs of our employees, while also reflecting local market practices. 
Our total rewards approach is designed to deliver cash, equity, and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by leading companies in the technology industry and reflect anticipated local market demands and evolving business needs. Other than the base salary program, all of our cash and equity programs are dependent upon the achievement of individual and company performance. In addition to competitive salaries and bonuses, we grant equity-based compensation to a significant portion of our employees. Equity serves as a key component in attracting, retaining, and motivating our employees. We also provide the opportunity for equity ownership through our employee stock purchase plan.
We provide competitive benefits that include retirement planning, health care, parental leave, flexible paid time off, and appreciation events for employees. In addition, we offer benefits to support our employees’ physical and mental health by providing tools and resources in areas such as digital training programs to help people improve mental wellbeing, flexible fitness platforms for physical activity, and telehealth services. We also offer a support platform for maternity and family benefits and a caregiver solution providing support for families of children with learning, social, or behavioral challenges.
We offer flexible work/life programs that embrace and engage our diverse population. We offer a unique peer to peer recognition program that reinforces our culture, values, and operating principles.
Talent Development
We offer learning and development opportunities that enable our workforce to acquire and expand skills and knowledge and have a meaningful and fulfilling career. To help employees succeed in their current roles, we provide formal training programs and curriculums in addition to on-the-job training. Our learning and development portal provides our employees with valuable resources such as a comprehensive online learning management program with training and development tools on a broad range of topics and skills.
Governance
We are committed to strong governance systems and policies that ensure fair, transparent and efficient business practices. Our Board has tasked its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“NCG”), along with senior leadership, with oversight responsibility for our ESG strategy and related initiatives. The NCG periodically receives updates from management on, and reviews, significant ESG and other corporate social responsibility and sustainability initiatives, policies and practices, and makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate. We also review and seek input from our investment community on their views on sustainability and ESG. The NCG's oversight responsibility also includes reviewing shareholder proposals, if any, received on ESG matters, and providing recommendations to the Board on the Company’s response to such proposals, as well

as recommendations for processes that would be helpful for the Board in overseeing how the Company manages material ESG issues.
We have adopted a Code of Conduct with annual trainings and provisions related to global ethical behavior and compliance with applicable laws, human rights, sustainability, diversity and inclusion, anti-corruption and anti-bribery regulations, along with enforcement and other dimensions of ethical conduct. We offer our employees and others the opportunity to report violations on an anonymous basis through a third-party hosted hotline, and our Code of Conduct expressly provides for non-retaliation for good faith reporting. We expect Poly employees, officers, directors, and contractors, as well as everyone working on our behalf worldwide, to adhere to these standards. 
We also are committed to responsible manufacturing of our products and responsible sourcing of materials. We require our suppliers to share in this commitment and have established the Supplier Code of Conduct, which outlines our expectations of Poly suppliers in conducting business in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner.
