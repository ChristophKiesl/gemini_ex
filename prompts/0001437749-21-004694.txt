Item 1. Business 
General 
 
USANA Health Sciences, Inc. is a publicly held direct-selling nutrition, personal health and wellness company. In 2020, we generated $1.135 billion in net sales and finished the year with approximately 599,000 active Customers worldwide. We were founded in 1992 by Myron W. Wentz, Ph.D. and since that time, we have developed and manufactured high quality, science-based nutritional, personal care and skincare products with a primary focus on promoting long-term health and wellness. In so doing, we are committed to continuous product innovation and sound scientific research. We have operations in 24 markets worldwide, where we distribute and sell our products by way of direct selling. Mainland China (“China”) is our largest market and single largest source of revenue, representing approximately 41% of net sales and approximately 38% of active Customers. We distribute our products through a network marketing system, which is a form of direct selling, as we believe it is the most conducive to meeting our vision, which is improving the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. As a U.S.-based multi-national corporation with an expanding international presence, our operating results are sensitive to currency fluctuations, as well as economic and political conditions in markets throughout the world. Additionally, we are subject to the various laws and regulations in the United States, China, and the other markets in which we operate with respect to the products that we manufacture, sell and our method of distribution.
 
Our customer base is primarily comprised of two types of customers: “Associates” and “Preferred Customers” referred to collectively as “active Customers.” Our Associates also sell our products to retail customers. Associates share in our vision by acting as independent distributors of our products, in addition to purchasing our products for their personal use. Preferred Customers purchase our products strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products. We only count as active Customers those Associates and Preferred Customers who have purchased from us at any time during the most recent three-month period.
 
This “Item 1. Business” provides detailed information about our worldwide business, including who we are, what we do and where we are headed. Unless otherwise specified, current information reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 (this “report” or “Annual Report”) is as of or for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021. We also discuss the development of our company and the geographic areas where we do business. For the year ended January 2, 2021, there were no material changes to our corporate structure or our method of conducting business.  
Current Focus and Growth Strategy
 
We have implemented or are implementing the following strategies and initiatives intended to increase the number of active Customers who use our products throughout the world and, thereby, further our business:

● | Customer Experience and Technology Enhancements. To generate active Customer growth, we are striving to enhance the overall experience a customer has when doing business with USANA. Because so much of our customer interaction is now digital, we will continue investing in digital transformation and enhancing the USANA customer experience. To do this, we will continue to improve the USANA shopping experience, introduce new digital tools and training for our Associates, and expand our options for customer communication. Improving our shopping experience will include adding shopping pages that will allow customers to easily find product information and benefits, and recommendation tools to help customers determine which products meet their needs. New digital tools and training for Associates will include share links that allow Associates to easily share products with interested customers, via an improved Associate USANA.com website and Associate digital onboarding, which will include a comprehensive training platform to help Associates learn about our digital tools and guided training on how to use them. Expanded options for customer communications will include adding text and chat support for our customers at all of our call centers.

● | Product Innovation and Deployment. Our research and development team continually reviews the latest scientific findings related to nutrition, conducts or manages research and clinical trials, reviews new technologies, and attends scientific conferences. If, in that process, we see potential for a new product or ingredient that provides a measurable and important health benefit, and we believe a significant number of our customers can realize this benefit, we will generally pursue development of that product or ingredient. For 2021, we will continue to broaden our product offering worldwide. Beginning in the second quarter, we will systematically introduce our new Active Nutrition line in the U.S. and several other markets and, as the year progresses, introduce this line into additional markets. This line will initially focus on weight loss and healthy meal replacement products. We intend to expand this line over the next several years. We will manufacture our food products in-house in our new facility located adjacent to our existing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. Additionally, we expect to begin producing our Celavive® products in-house. These vertical integration efforts will provide us with several advantages over third-party manufacturing.

● | Existing Market Growth and New Market Expansion. We will continue to focus on generating growth in our existing markets during 2021. To do this, we will focus on customer acquisition through a combination of new product offerings, customer onboarding and engagement efforts, and incentive offerings. We will continue to develop and implement market-specific programs that address the needs of individual markets. We plan to run programs that were impactful in 2020 while utilizing market specific initiatives that have proven successful. We also believe it is time for us to identify and expand into our next international market. During 2021, we will continue to lay the groundwork for this new market and we plan to announce this market in 2022. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions/ Collaborations. In 2020, we closed a strategic collaboration and minority investment with Built Brands, a company known for their unique and great-tasting protein bars. This collaboration has allowed us to accelerate the development, enhancement, and expansion of healthy nutrition bars in our Active Nutrition line. We will continue to evaluate similar business development and acquisition opportunities that strengthen, diversify and grow our worldwide business. We intend to explore and pursue strategic opportunities to grow our customer base, expand our product lines, enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise, further vertical integration, or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase Brand Awareness. Historically, we have pursued strategies to increase our brand awareness around the world to accomplish our vision. These strategies have included our relationship with Dr. Mehmet Oz as a Trusted Partner and Sponsor of The Dr. Oz Show. Under this partnership, The Dr. Oz Show regularly features USANA products and viewers of the show are able to purchase USANA products via a direct link on The Dr. Oz Show website. We have also promoted global awareness of the USANA brand through professional athlete sponsorships and credible associations with individuals and organizations. We will continue to utilize these types of brand awareness strategies.

● | China Strategy. Our growth strategies for our China business are in line with our global growth strategies, but are tailored for China. These strategies include, (i) continuing our efforts to transform digitally, (ii) launching new products throughout the year, and (iii) enhancing the customer experience by improving our branch office locations.

Geographic Presence 
 
Our products are distributed and sold in 24 markets. We have organized our markets into two geographic regions: (1) Asia Pacific, and (2) Americas and Europe. Asia Pacific is further divided into three sub-regions: (i) Greater China, (ii) Southeast Asia Pacific, and (iii) North Asia.  The countries included in these regions and sub-regions are described below:
Asia Pacific
 

(1) | Asia Pacific is organized into three sub-regions: Greater China, Southeast Asia Pacific, and North Asia. Markets included in each of these sub-regions are as follows:
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i) | Greater China - Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. Our business in China is conducted by BabyCare
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Southeast Asia Pacific – Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | North Asia – Japan and South Korea
------+-----------------------------------

 
We have historically generated year-over-year net sales and active Customer growth and the Asia Pacific region has historically driven that growth. Our strategy in Asia Pacific has been centered, in great part, on generating growth in China.  In 2019, we encountered a challenging consumer environment in China which caused our net sales and active Customer counts to decline; however, our results in China improved in the second-half of 2019 and continued to improve in 2020, despite challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we continued to see meaningful growth in South Korea, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Going forward, we believe we have strategies in place to grow in most, if not all, of the markets within this region.  
 
Americas and Europe 
 

(2) | Americas and Europe – United States, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany(1), Spain(1), Italy(1), Romania(1), Belgium, and the Netherlands
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(1) We commenced operations in these markets near the end of the second quarter of 2018.  
 
Our Americas and Europe region includes our most mature markets and several of our newest markets. Prior to 2020, net sales in this region had decreased on a constant currency basis due to declines in the number of active Customers in several markets within the region including the United States. In 2020, we generated year-over-year constant currency sales growth in every market in this region, and increases in the number of active Customers in all but one of our markets. We plan to execute the growth strategies, referenced in this Annual Report to generate sales and active Customer growth in this region.  
 
Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange
 
Because we have operations in multiple markets, with sales and expenses generated and incurred in multiple currencies, our reported U.S. dollar sales and earnings can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  In general, our operating results are affected positively by a weakening of the U.S. dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In 2020, net sales outside of the United States represented approximately 90.5% of consolidated net sales.
Research and Development
 
We focus our research and development (“R&D”) efforts on developing and bringing to market high quality, science-based products that promote long-term health and wellness. Our R&D activities include developing products that are new to USANA and new to the industry, updating existing USANA-brand formulas to keep them current with the latest science, and adapting existing formulas to meet ever-changing consumer preferences and regulations in global markets.
 
Our scientific staff includes experts on human nutrition, cellular biology, biochemistry, genetics, the microbiome, natural product chemistry, and clinical research. These experts continually review the latest published research on nutrition, present their findings at scientific conferences, publish in scientific journals, and collaborate with third-party researchers and institutions to identify possible new products and product upgrade opportunities.  
 
The R&D team is also involved in protecting our proprietary position with exclusive ingredients, proprietary formulations, product-specific scientific validation, and, in some cases, patent protection. In 2020, we announced the issuance of U.S. Patent 10,632,101 for our InCelligence complex formula. Research continues to support our proprietary InCelligence technology, advances in microbiome supplementation, immune system support, stress adaptation, and brain health. 
 
Our in-house research team has established and maintained good working relationships with scientists at a number of universities and research institutes, including the University of Washington, the University of Texas Medical Branch - Galveston, the University of Utah, The Foods for Health Institute at The University of California, Davis, Peking University (China), Central Queensland University (Australia), University of Ghent (Belgium), the Brain Institute at the University of Utah, and other academic institutions globally. These relationships help us continue to advance our knowledge, expertise and leadership in several areas of applied human nutrition.

When developing and manufacturing our products we follow the highest applicable industry quality standards, as established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), U.S. Pharmacopeia (“USP”), other leading non-governmental agencies (“NGO”), and government agencies. Our ingredients are selected to meet a number of criteria, including, but not limited to safety, potency, purity, stability, bioavailability, and efficacy.  We control the quality of our products throughout all our internal processes, beginning at the formulation stage. We maintain our quality control through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients, manufacturing, packaging and labeling, with testing occurring at several stages of manufacturing.
 
In fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, we expended $10.6 million, $10.3 million, and $10.2 million, respectively, on product R&D activities.  Going forward, we expect to continue to increase our spending and resources for R&D to advance our expertise and leadership in cellular nutrition, as well as overall health and wellness. We believe our attention to product quality is a sustainable competitive advantage that also provides a substantial barrier to entry for competitors who wish to enter our space.
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 
We conduct manufacturing, production and quality control operations for approximately 65% of our products in-house. We have established and maintain a manufacturing and quality control facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 2019, we expanded this facility to allow us to manufacture our food products in-house. This facility started to produce saleable product during the fourth quarter of 2020. BabyCare manufactures and produces a significant portion of its products in-house and maintains manufacturing and quality control facilities in Beijing, China and Tianjin, China. This section of this Annual Report gives you more information about our manufacturing, production and quality control operations.
Manufacturing
 
Our production process uses automatic and semi-automatic equipment and includes the following activities by type:

We conduct sample testing of raw materials, in-process materials, and finished products for purity, potency, and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications, and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests. We employ a qualified staff of professionals to develop, implement and maintain a quality system designed to assure that our products are manufactured to our internal and applicable regulatory agency specifications.
 
Our Salt Lake City, Utah manufacturing facility is registered, as required, with the FDA, Health Canada Natural Health Products Directorate, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”), and other governmental agencies. These and other various organizations and government agencies regularly audit this facility to assess, among other things, compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”) and with labeling claims. Additionally, our Salt Lake City, Utah manufacturing facility is certified, through inspection and audits, with the Islamic Foods and Nutrition Counsel of America in compliance with Halal, The Organized Kashrus Laboratories in compliance with Kosher, NSF International in compliance with product testing and GMPs, and the TGA in compliance with the current Therapeutic Goods Act in Australia.
 
The manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement GMPs, which are based on the food-model GMPs and pharmaceutical GMPs, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We are audited by the FDA, specifically for dietary supplements, and have historically been found in compliance with GMPs for dietary supplements. Although the FDA has not promulgated GMPs for personal care items, it has issued guidelines for manufacturing personal care products. We voluntarily maintain compliance with the guidance established by the FDA and the Personal Care Products Council.
 
Our Beijing, China manufacturing facility is registered with State Administration of Market Regulation (“SAMR”), which incorporated the China Food and Drug Administration in 2018 as part of a larger reorganization of the Chinese government. Our facility in Beijing is audited regularly by various organizations and government agencies to assess, among other things, compliance with applicable GMPs, and with labeling claims.

Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers
 
We contract with third-party suppliers and manufacturers for the production of certain of our products, which account for approximately 35% of our product sales. These third-party suppliers and manufacturers produce and, in most cases, package these products according to formulations that have been developed by or in conjunction with our in-house product development team. These products include most of our gelatin-capsulated supplements, Rev3 Energy® Drink, Probiotic, our powdered drink mixes, foods and certain personal care and skincare products, including our Celavive line for markets outside of China. Products manufactured by third-party suppliers at their locations must also pass through quality control and assurance procedures to ensure they are manufactured in conformance with our specifications. As noted above, with the expansion of our manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, we have started to self-manufacture our foods product line. Additionally, we plan to increase the proportion of the personal care and skincare products that we manufacture. This will reduce our reliance on third-party suppliers and manufacturers and add to our operating strengths, which are described below in this Annual Report.
 
Quality Control and Assurance
 
We have in-house microbiology and analytical chemistry labs in which we conduct quality control processes. In our microbiology laboratory, scientists test for biological contamination of raw materials and finished goods. In our analytical chemistry laboratory, scientists test for chemical contamination and accurate levels of active ingredients in both raw materials and finished products. Scientists also identify and confirm all raw materials used in the manufacturing process through scientifically valid means. Both laboratories conduct stability tests on finished products to determine the shelf life of our products. Our Salt Lake City, Utah laboratory staff also performs chemical assays on vitamin and mineral constituents, using USP methods and other internally validated methods. In addition to our quality control and clinical laboratories, both our headquarters and China facilities also house a laboratory designated for R&D.
Raw Materials
 
Most of the raw ingredients used in the manufacture of our products are available from a number of suppliers. Our raw material suppliers must demonstrate stringent process and quality control before we use their products in our manufacturing process. When supplies of certain raw materials have tightened, we have been able to find alternative sources of raw materials, and believe we will be able to do so in the future, if the need arises. While we have not experienced any meaningful disruption to our world-wide supply chain, it is possible that such disruptions could occur if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact markets around the world for a prolonged period.
Distribution and Marketing 
 
General
 
We distribute our products internationally through direct selling, which entails person-to-person marketing and selling of products. Direct selling is based on the strength of personal relationships and recommendations that frequently come from friends, neighbors, relatives, and close acquaintances. We believe that direct selling is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person-to-person product education, as well as higher levels of customer service, all of which are not as readily available through other distribution channels. 
Structure of Direct Selling Program 
 
Overview. Although our direct selling philosophy and strategy are generally consistent in our markets around the world, certain aspects of our business may differ from market to market as a result of different legal and regulatory regimes, operational requirements or other factors. These differences may include how individuals join USANA, the compensation they are paid, the products they sell, and other components of their relationship with USANA. For example, China has enacted and maintains unique business laws and regulations governing direct selling that differ materially from our other markets around the world. Consequently, we have adjusted our direct selling program in China to comply with these laws and regulations. To do this, we operate our business in China through BabyCare. BabyCare utilizes a business model in China that is consistent with the philosophy of our worldwide business model, but different in structure from our other markets. These differences are explained below under “China Business.”
Associates. Outside of China, a person who wishes to sell USANA products must join our independent sales force as an Associate. A person becomes a USANA Associate by completing an application under the sponsorship of an existing Associate. The new Associate then becomes part of the sponsoring Associate’s sales organization. New Associates must agree to adhere to the USANA policies and procedures. Under our policies and procedures, Associates may not, among other things: (i) use deceptive or unlawful practices to sell USANA products; (ii) make deceptive or unlawful claims or representations concerning our products or Compensation Plan; or (iii) sell competitive products to other USANA Associates or solicit USANA Associates to participate in other direct selling opportunities. Associates who violate our policies are subject to discipline, which may include the termination of their purchase and distribution rights. New Associates are required to purchase a starter kit that includes a detailed manual describing our business and products, as well as our policies and procedures. We sell these kits at a nominal price averaging $20 in each of our markets and these kits are fully refundable under our return policy, which is described elsewhere in this report. No other direct investment is required to become an Associate.
 
Once a person becomes an Associate, she or he may purchase products directly from us at wholesale prices for their personal use and for resale to customers. Our Associates are also entitled to build sales organizations by attracting, enrolling and selling product to new customers. Associates are not required to recruit or sponsor new Associates and we do not compensate Associates for sponsoring or recruiting Associates. The sponsoring of new Associates results in the creation of multiple levels within our direct sales structure. Sponsored Associates are referred to as part of the sales organization of the sponsoring Associate. New Associates in turn may sponsor new Associates and Preferred Customers, creating additional levels in their sales network, but also forming a part of the same sales organization as the original sponsoring Associate. As outlined below, Associates who are interested in earning income with USANA must successfully sell USANA products and establish a network of product consumers in order to qualify for commissions, including bonuses. Subject to payment of a minimal annual account renewal fee, Associates may continue to distribute or consume our products as long as they adhere to our policies and procedures.
 
Associate Compensation. This section describes our Associate Compensation Plan generally, except for our China operations, which are discussed separately below under the caption “China Business.” Our Compensation Plan provides several opportunities for Associates to earn compensation, provided they are willing to work consistently at (i) sharing, marketing and selling USANA products to consumers, and (ii) building, training, and retaining their sales organizations. The purpose behind each form of compensation under our Compensation Plan is to reward committed Associates for generating product sales either directly or indirectly through their sales organization and network of product consumers.
 
    6 

  

Associates can earn compensation under the Compensation Plan in four ways:
 

● | Commissions. The primary way an Associate is compensated is through earning commissions. Associates earn commissions by generating sales volume points, which are based on product sales of their sales organization. We have assigned each of our products a sales volume point value comprised of a certain percentage of the product price in U.S. dollars. To be eligible to earn commissions, an Associate must sell a certain amount of product each month. Associates do not earn commissions for simply recruiting and enrolling others in their organization. Commissions are paid only on the sale of products. In most markets, we pay Associates their commissions on a weekly basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Bonuses. We offer Associates several bonus opportunities, including our leadership bonus, elite bonus, and lifetime matching bonus. These bonus opportunities are based on a pay-for-performance philosophy and, therefore, are paid out when the Associate achieves certain performance measures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Retail Mark-Ups. As discussed previously, in markets where retail mark-ups are permitted, our Associates purchase products from us at the Preferred Price and may resell them to consumers at higher retail prices. This allows the Associate to retain the retail mark-up as another form of compensation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Contests and Promotions. We regularly sponsor contests and promotions designed to incentivize Associates to generate sales, grow their active Customer base and ultimately increase the number of USANA product users. These promotions are also based on a pay-for-performance philosophy and, therefore, are only paid upon the achievement of certain objectives.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
With the exception of our China market (discussed below), we endeavor to integrate our Compensation Plan seamlessly across all markets where legally permissible, allowing Associates to receive commissions for global—not merely local—product sales. This seamless sales organization structure is designed to allow Associates to build a global network by establishing or expanding their sales organization in any of the markets where we operate. We believe our Compensation Plan significantly enhances our ability to expand internationally, and we intend to continue to integrate new markets, where permitted, into our Compensation Plan.
 
Preferred Customers and Retail Customers. We also sell products directly to Preferred Customers and retail customers who purchase the products only for their personal use. Preferred Customers enroll with USANA, generally through an introduction by an Associate, and purchase product directly from the Company. Retail customers, however, generally purchase directly from Associates. Neither Preferred Customers nor retail customers may resell or distribute our products, regardless of where they purchased them. To sell USANA products, a Preferred Customer or retail customer must become an Associate.
 
These various customer programs give us access to a customer market that would otherwise be missed, by targeting consumers who enjoy USANA products, but who prefer not to maintain a distribution relationship with us. Although our policies prohibit Preferred Customers and retail customers from engaging in retail sales of products, they may enroll as Associates at any time in the future, if they desire.
 
China Business.  As explained above, the Chinese government maintains direct selling laws and regulations that differ materially from our other markets around the world. While these laws and regulations permit direct selling, they impose a number of financial and operational restrictions, including a prohibition of pyramid selling and multi-level compensation systems. The Chinese government has also implemented a number of administrative and regulatory methods around direct selling to control these prohibited activities. To reduce the risk that the Chinese government might view BabyCare’s business model as conflicting with these laws and regulations, BabyCare utilizes a business model that is different from the model we use elsewhere in the world. BabyCare’s business model has been developed specifically for the China market and is based on, among other things: (i) BabyCare’s communications with the Chinese government, (ii) BabyCare’s interpretation of China's direct selling laws and regulations, as well as its understanding of how the government interprets and enforces the regulations, and (iii) BabyCare’s understanding of how other multinational direct selling companies operate in China. Consequently, individuals who join BabyCare in China do not participate in our Compensation Plan outside of China; instead, they are compensated under BabyCare’s compensation plan, which has been established for China. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BabyCare has not received approval from the Chinese government that its business model, compensation plan or operations comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those pertaining to direct selling.
 
BabyCare sells products in China through a variety of methods, including: (a) online through its website; (b) at physical branch retail locations; (c) through direct sellers in provinces and municipalities where BabyCare has received a direct sales authorization granted by the local provincial government; and (d) through independent distributors who are considered independent business owners under Chinese law. Individuals who reside in China and who are interested in being part of our business in China may do so by enrolling with BabyCare. While the process for enrolling with BabyCare is similar to the process for joining our business in other markets, individuals must initially enroll with BabyCare as a China Preferred Customer, or CPC. CPCs are similar to Preferred Customers in our other markets, but CPCs may also refer other CPCs in China and receive free product value from us on future product purchases based on the volume of product purchased by CPCs they have referred.
 
    7 

  

A CPC may become a direct seller or independent distributor (which we report collectively as Associates in the related customer tables in this Annual Report) in China by electing to do so and agreeing to adhere to BabyCare’s policies and procedures in China. Our direct sellers in China are permitted by our policies and the terms of our direct selling licenses to sell product away from fixed retail locations in the provinces and municipalities where BabyCare has been granted a local direct selling authorization. Direct sellers are compensated for their sales under BabyCare’s compensation plan and do not receive compensation for promotional, marketing, or sales services that distributors are eligible to receive (as described below). Distributors are independent business owners who sell BabyCare’s products in China and also provide promotional, marketing, and sales services for BabyCare in China. Under BabyCare’s compensation plan, distributors are compensated not only for their own product sales, but also for their productivity in providing these promotional, marketing and sales services instead of the elements of USANA’s Compensation Plan outside of China. BabyCare’s compensation to its distributors for these services is intended and designed to be business-to-business compensation under Chinese law. To calculate distributor compensation for these services, we (i) use our world-wide Compensation Plan, which computes personal sales volume, group sales volume and other metrics (similar to those for Associate compensation in markets outside of China) for the group of CPCs, distributors and others in China to whom the distributor provides promotional, marketing and sales services on behalf of BabyCare, (ii) convert the calculation to fee-based compensation for the various services performed by the distributor; and (iii) pay the corresponding service fee to the distributor in China on a monthly basis. The fee-based compensation we pay our China distributors for these various services is comparable to the compensation available to our Associates in other markets and competitive with other direct selling companies in China.
 
BabyCare’s business model, compensation plan and operations in China involve certain risks and uncertainties, as discussed further in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We endeavor to mitigate these risks and uncertainties through various measures, including by seeking to understand and obey laws and regulations, training our employees and sales force, engaging in dialogue with government officials to better understand their goals and explain our plans, and cooperating in inquiries and other matters of interest to regulators. However, these efforts do not completely eliminate the significant risks associated with BabyCare’s operations in China.
 
Associate Training and Motivation. Initial training of Associates about USANA, our products and Compensation Plan, and global network marketing in general, is provided primarily by an Associate’s sponsor and others in the Associate’s sales organization. We develop and sell training materials and sales tools to assist Associates in building their businesses, and we provide reprints from commercial publications that feature USANA that may be used as sales tools. We also sponsor and conduct regional, national, and international Associate events, as well as intensive leadership training seminars. Attendance at these sessions is voluntary, and we undertake no generalized effort to provide individualized training to Associates, although experience shows that the most effective and successful Associates tend to be those who participate in such training activities. Although we provide leadership training and sales tools, we ultimately rely on our Associates to sell our products, attract new customers to purchase our products, and to educate and train new Associates regarding our products and Compensation Plan.
Operating Strengths 
 
Our principal objective is to improve the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world.  We do this through (i) developing and manufacturing high-quality, science-based nutritional, and personal care and skincare products that promote long-term health, (ii) personalizing our products to our customers’ needs and desires; and (iii) providing a global direct selling opportunity for our Associates who desire to distribute our products and earn supplemental income. Our strategy is to capitalize on our operating strengths, which include a strong R&D program; significant in-house manufacturing capability; high quality science-based products; an equitable Associate Compensation Plan; a scalable business model; and an experienced management team.
 
Emphasis on Research and Development. We have a technical team of experienced scientists, including several holding doctoral degrees, quality engineers, and regulatory specialists who contribute to our R&D activities. In our R&D laboratories, our scientists and researchers:
 

● | Investigate activities of natural extracts and formulated products in laboratory and clinical settings;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identify and research combinations of nutrients that may be candidates for new products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop new nutritional ingredients for use in supplements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Study the metabolic activities of existing and newly identified nutritional ingredients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhance existing USANA brand products, as new discoveries in nutrition and skincare are made;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Formulate products to meet diverse regulatory requirements across all of our markets; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investigate processes for improving the production of our formulated products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our in-house research team also conducts double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies, which are intended to further evaluate the efficacy of our products. In addition, we collaborate with outside research organizations to further support various aspects of our R&D efforts. Our in-house research team works closely with scientists at a number of universities and research institutes, including those listed under the caption “Research and Development” above, to maintain our leadership in clinical research in nutrition, oxidative stress, glycemic stress, chronic inflammation and health implications of the microbiome. We have also funded clinical research programs at Boston University, the University of Colorado, the University of Utah, the University of Sydney in Australia, The Orthopedic Specialty Hospital (or “TOSH”), and Utah State University. It is through our internal R&D efforts, as well as our relationships with outside research organizations and health care providers, that we can provide what we believe to be some of the highest quality health products in the industry.

In-house Manufacturing. We manufacture products that account for approximately 65% of our product sales. We believe that our ability to manufacture our own products in-house is a significant competitive advantage for the following reasons:

● | We can better control the quality of raw materials and finished products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We can more reliably monitor the manufacturing process to better guarantee potency and bioavailability and to reduce the risk of product contamination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We can better control production schedules to increase the likelihood of maintaining an uninterrupted supply of products for our customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are able to produce most of our own prototypes in the research phase of product development; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are better able to manage the underlying costs associated with manufacturing our products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Science-based Quality Products. As a result of our emphasis on R&D and our in-house manufacturing capabilities, we have developed a line of high quality products that we believe provides health benefits to our customers. Our products have been developed based on a combination of published research, in-house laboratory and third-party clinical studies, and sponsored research.
Equitable Associate Compensation Plan and Support. We are committed to increasing our product sales by providing a competitive compensation plan that attracts and retains Associates who constitute our sales force. We motivate our Associates by paying incentives on a weekly basis in most markets. Where permissible, our Compensation Plan is implemented as a global-seamless plan, meaning that Associates can be compensated each week for their business success in any market in which they have product consumers and/or a sales organization where we conduct business. Our China operations maintain their own compensation plan, which is structured differently than USANA’s plan in other markets. In China, we pay Associates on a monthly basis. 
 
To support our Associates, we sponsor meetings and events throughout the year, where we offer information about our products and our global network marketing system. These meetings are designed to assist Associates in business development and to provide a forum for interaction with some of our Associate leaders and with members of the USANA management team. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we began utilizing a virtual event strategy to hold meetings and events with our Associates. We also provide low-cost sales tools and resources, which we believe are an integral part of building and maintaining a successful home-based business for our Associates.
 
In addition to company-sponsored meetings, sales tools and resources, we maintain a website exclusively for our Associates, where they can access the latest USANA news, obtain training materials, manage their personal information, enroll new customers, shop for products, and register for company-sponsored events. Additionally, through this website, Associates can access other online services to which they may subscribe. For example, we offer an online business management service, which includes a tool that helps Associates track and manage their business activity, a personal webpage to which prospects or retail customers can be directed, and e-cards for advertising.
 
We also believe that recognition is an important factor in supporting and retaining our Associates. We understand that being a successful USANA Associate requires hard work and dedication, and we celebrate key achievements and rank advancements of our Associates. We believe that our recognition programs greatly contribute to our ability to retain our Associates.
 
Business Model. We believe that our direct-selling business model provides, among others, the following advantages:
 

● | No requirement for a company-employed sales force to sell our products, with a relatively low incremental cost to add a new active Customer;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commissions paid to our Associates are tied to sales performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accounts receivable are minimal because payment is required at the time an active Customer purchases product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A stream of recurring revenue generated from our monthly product subscription program known as “Auto Order,” which we utilize in all of our markets (this program offers a 10% price discount and represented 60% of our product sales volume for the year ended January 2, 2021); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to expand into new international markets with moderate investment because we generally maintain only warehouse facilities, customer support, and minimal administrative facilities in those international markets. Larger markets, including China, however, require more significant local investment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Experienced Management Team. Our management team includes individuals with expertise in various scientific and managerial disciplines, including global network marketing, nutrition, product research and development, international development, marketing, sales, information technology, manufacturing, finance, legal, regulatory, and operations. This team is responsible for supporting growth, R&D, international expansion, strengthening our financial condition, and improving our internal controls.

Competition
 
Our industry is very competitive and the barriers to entry are not significant. We compete with manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of nutritional products in many channels, including global network marketing, specialty retail stores, wholesale stores, and the internet generally. We also compete with other public and privately owned global network marketers for distributor talent, including for example Amway, Herbalife, and Nu Skin. On both fronts, compared to USANA, some of our competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history, higher visibility and name recognition, and greater financial resources. We compete with these entities by emphasizing to our Associates, Preferred Customers, and potential customers the strengths of our business, as described in the "Operating Strengths" section above.  
 
Product Returns
 
Product returns have not been a material factor in our business, totaling approximately 0.7% of net sales in 2020, 2019, and 2018. Customer satisfaction has always been and will continue to be a hallmark of our business. We believe that we have always offered a generous product return policy. Our standard return policy allows Associates and Preferred Customers to receive a 100% refund on the purchase price of any unused and resalable products that are returned up to one year from the date of purchase. This standard policy differs slightly in a few of our international markets due to applicable regulations in those markets. To avoid manipulation of our Compensation Plan, return of product when the purchase amount exceeds $100 and the product was not damaged at the time of receipt by the Associate may result in cancellation of an Associate’s distributorship.
Major Customers
 
We sell product to independent Associates and Preferred Customers. No single Associate or Preferred Customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in any of the last three fiscal years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the nature of our business model results in a significant amount of sales to several different Associate leaders and their sales organizations. Although no single Associate accounted for 10% or more of our annual net sales, the loss of a key Associate leader or that Associate’s sales organization could adversely affect our net sales and our overall operating results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 
Associate Compliance
 
Our reputation depends upon the quality of our products and the integrity of our Associates. We continually monitor and review our Associates’ compliance with our policies and procedures as well as the laws and regulations applicable to our business around the world. Part of this review entails an assessment of our Associates’ sales activities to ensure that they are actually selling products to consumers. Our policies and procedures require Associates to present our products and the USANA opportunity ethically and honestly. Associates are not permitted to make claims about our products or Compensation Plan that are not consistent with our policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations. The majority of our Associates must use marketing and promotional materials provided by USANA. Associates are permitted to produce their own marketing and promotional materials. However, prior to doing so, Associates are required to complete an Advertising Certification to help educate them and prevent them from making unapproved product and business claims.
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we encounter Associates who fail to adhere to our policies and procedures. We systematically review reports of alleged Associate misbehavior. Infractions of the policies and procedures are reported to our Ethics and Education group, who determine what, if any, disciplinary action is warranted in each case. More serious infractions are also reported to our Ethics Committee, which includes USANA executives. If we determine that an Associate has violated any of our policies and procedures, we may take a number of disciplinary actions, including warnings, fines or probation. Among other measures, we may also withdraw or deny awards, suspend privileges, withhold commissions until specific conditions are satisfied, or take other appropriate actions in our discretion, including termination of the Associate’s purchase and distribution rights.
 
Because we believe that Associate compliance is critical to the integrity of our business, we are aggressive in ensuring that our Associates comply with our policies and procedures. When an Associate fails to comply with our policies and procedures, we may terminate the Associate’s purchase and distribution rights. From time to time, we become involved in litigation with Associates whose purchase and distribution rights have been terminated. We consider such litigation to be routine and incidental to our business and we will continue to be aggressive in ensuring that our Associates comply with our policies and procedures.
 
Information Technology 
 
We believe that the ability to efficiently manage sales, active Customer data, distribution, compensation, manufacturing, inventory, and communication functions through the use of secure, sophisticated, and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success.  We continually evaluate changes in the information technology environment to ensure that we are capitalizing on new technologies, keeping pace with regulatory standards, and ensuring that our systems and data are secure. Over the last several years, we have meaningfully invested in technology systems and infrastructure to create a better overall customer experience for our customers and we will continue to invest in this area going forward.
 
    10 

  

Our information technology resources are maintained primarily by our in-house staff to optimally support our customer base and core business processes. Our IT staff manages an array of systems and processes that support our global operations 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Three of our most critical applications include:
 

● | A web-based application that provides online services to Associates, such as training sessions and presentations, online shopping, enrollment, a real-time reporting engine, Company and product information, web hosting, email, and other tools to help Associates effectively manage their business and sales organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A web-based order-entry system that handles order entry, customer information, compensation, Associate business structure, returns, invoices, and other transactional-based processes; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A fully integrated world-wide Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system that handles accounting, human resources, inventory management, production processes, quality assurance, and reporting requirements in a multinational environment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our web applications are supported by a clustered environment providing high availability. All production systems are fully backed up and stored off-site to mitigate the risk of significant interruption of our business in the event of a disaster at the locations of our primary servers.
 
For information regarding technology-related risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “We rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. A data security failure involving that technology or the data stored in it, could disrupt our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results and our reputation, and expose us to potential liability or litigation. Likewise, a data breach at USANA could lead to significant liability and reputational damage.”

Regulatory Matters 
 
General. In every jurisdiction in which we operate, our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation. These regulations exist at various national and local levels and pertain to our products, direct selling, and other aspects of our business. In this section, we describe the material regulations that are applicable to our business.
Product Regulation. Numerous governmental agencies regulate the formulation, manufacturing, holding, packaging, labeling, advertising, promoting, importing, distributing, shipping, and selling of health supplements, cosmetics, and foods. In the United States, these agencies include the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) under the FTC Act, as amended, the FDA, under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (“FDCA”) and related regulations, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Customs and Border Patrol, and the United States Postal Service.
 
Our largest selling product group includes products that are regulated as dietary supplements under the FDCA. Dietary supplements are also regulated in the United States under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, as amended (“DSHEA”), which we believe is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry. Some of our powdered drink, food bar, and other nutrition products are regulated as foods under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, as amended (“NLEA”). The NLEA establishes requirements for ingredient and nutritional labeling including product labeling claims. The manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement GMPs, which are based on the food-model GMPs and Pharmaceutical GMPs, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We are audited annually by the FDA, specifically for dietary supplements and have been found in compliance with GMPs for dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement & Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers of dietary supplements and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products to notify the FDA when they receive reports of serious adverse events occurring within the United States. We have an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years, and we believe that we comply with this law.
 
In general, our personal care and skincare products, which are regulated as cosmetic products by the FDA, are not subject to pre-market approval by that agency. Cosmetics, however, are subject to regulation by the FDA under the adulteration and misbranding provisions of the FDCA. Cosmetics also are subject to specific labeling regulations, including warning statements, if the safety of a cosmetic is not adequately substantiated or if the product may be hazardous, as well as ingredient statements and other packaging requirements under The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Cosmetics that meet the definition of a drug, such as sunscreens, are regulated as drugs. OTC drug products, including cosmetics, may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of the OTC monograph that is applicable to that drug. Drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved New Drug Application (“NDA”) before marketing may begin. Under these provisions, if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our OTC drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph that is applicable to one of our OTC drug products, we would be required to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved NDA or until the time, if ever, that the monograph is amended to include such product.
 
    11 

  

Advertising of our products in the United States is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTC Act. Under the FTC’s Substantiation Doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a “reasonable basis” for all objective product claims before making the claims. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States. In recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplement, weight-management, and cosmetic products. The FTC has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement. We believe that we have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States, and we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines. However, no assurance can be given that the FTC would reach the same conclusion if it were to review or question our substantiation for our advertising claims in the United States.
 
The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. During 2020, for example, the FTC sent warning letters to several nutrition companies and direct-selling companies for advertising claims that the company and/or its sales people were making about the respective company's products ability to prevent or treat COVID-19.  Failure to adhere to FTC warning letters or other orders can result in substantial financial or other penalties. Although, to our knowledge, we have not been the subject of any action by the FTC, no assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products successfully in the United States.
 
The manufacturing, labeling, and advertising of our products are also regulated by various governmental agencies outside the United States in each country where they are distributed. In China, our nutritional products are typically classified as “health functional foods” and our personal care and skincare products are classified typically as “non-special use cosmetics.” The registration process for health functional foods in China is complex and can be unpredictable. It generally requires extensive analysis and approval by the SAMR. As a result, it can take several years to register a product as a health functional food in China. While all products currently sold by BabyCare in China have been registered with the SAMR, we continue to work through the registration process for other health functional food products, which we also hope to begin selling through BabyCare in the future.  SAMR and other governmental agencies also enforce advertising and other regulations that restrict the ability of health products companies to advertise the benefits of their products in China.  In 2019, because of non-compliant advertising made by certain companies about the benefits of their products, SAMR and other departments of the Chinese government initiated a review of the health products and direct selling industries in China. Negative media attention surrounding this review harmed consumer perception of the health products industry and negatively affected our business in China and the general operating environment for health products and direct selling companies.
 
In Australia, the TGA regulates product registration, labeling and manufacturing. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare regulates these activities. Upon entering a new market, prior to commencing operations or marketing products, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications from that country’s Food Administration, Ministry of Health or comparable agency. Approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of USANA products for the particular market or approval or licensing otherwise may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients in a given market.
 
We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. Future changes could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
 
Direct Selling Regulation. Various laws and regulations in all of our markets regulate direct selling. These laws and regulations exist at many levels of government in many different forms, including statutes, rules, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative orders. Generally, the regulations are directed at: (i) ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that compensation from or advancement within a sales organization is based on product sales rather than on recruiting, other investments in the organization or other criteria that are not related to sales; and (ii) preventing the use of deceptive or fraudulent practices that have been at times inappropriately associated with legitimate direct selling activities. Direct selling regulations are inherently fact-based and often do not include “bright line” rules. In most of our markets, these regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and respective legal authorities. Consequently, the regulations, or a regulator’s interpretation and enforcement of the regulations, could change at any time. If that were to occur, we may be required to change our business model in the respective market in an effort to comply.
 
In the United States, the FTC has jurisdiction to regulate direct selling companies under the FTC Act. The FTC’s interpretation of the applicable direct selling laws and regulations has evolved over the last several years as represented in various consent orders between the FTC and certain direct selling companies, informal guidance issued by the FTC to the direct selling industry and informal communications from the FTC to the industry. The FTC, through these consent orders, guidance and communications, has addressed a variety of consumer protection issues, including misleading earnings representations by a company’s independent distributors, as well as the fairness and legal validity of a company’s business model and distributor compensation plan. In 2020, the FTC sent warning letters to several direct-selling companies for income claims made by the company or its sales force regarding the amount of income an individual could earn by selling the respective company’s products during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The consent orders, guidance and communication from the FTC have also created ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the proper interpretation of the laws, regulations and judicial precedent applicable to direct selling in the United States.
 
As noted above, the Chinese government has adopted direct selling laws and regulations that contain a number of financial and operational restrictions on direct selling companies, as well as prohibitions on pyramid selling and multi-level compensation. These regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation and enforcement by various municipal, provincial and state officials in China. Departments within the Chinese government that regulate direct selling include, the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), the Ministry of Public Security (“MPS”) and their regional and local counterparts. BabyCare’s business model has been developed specifically for China based on, among other things: (i) BabyCare’s communications with the Chinese government, (ii) BabyCare’s interpretation of the direct selling laws and regulations, as well as its understanding of how the government interprets and enforces the regulations, and (iii) BabyCare’s understanding of how other multinational direct selling companies operate in China.
 
    12 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the direct selling industry in China, as well as the regulatory environment for the industry, continues to evolve and receive significant attention and scrutiny from the Chinese government and the Chinese media. As noted above, in 2019, following unfavorable media coverage of certain health product companies and direct selling companies, several departments of the Chinese government, including SAMR, MPS, and MOFCOM, initiated a review of health product and direct selling companies. This review required direct-selling companies in China such as BabyCare to conduct a self-assessment of the regulatory compliance of their business (including product regulatory compliance and direct selling regulatory compliance) and to provide information to the Chinese government regarding that assessment. The review also entailed a review of direct sellers' regulatory compliance by various departments of the Chinese government. During this review, the Chinese government, among other things, instructed direct selling companies not to hold large distributor meetings, and suspended its application review process for direct sales licenses and authorizations. The Chinese government has yet to re-open the application review process for direct sales licenses and authorizations or indicate if or when it plans to do so. The Chinese government's scrutiny of the direct selling industry has been higher following the 2019 review.  
 
The Chinese government has taken action historically against direct selling companies that it believes have violated the government’s direct selling regulations and anti-pyramiding laws. The government’s action in this regard has entailed investigating direct selling companies and their distributors, imposing significant fines and, in some cases, shutting down companies it believed to be in violation. Historically, there have been instances when inquiries or complaints about BabyCare’s business resulted in warnings from the Chinese government, as well as the payment of fines by BabyCare or its distributors.
 
BabyCare has obtained direct selling licenses in certain provinces and municipalities, and it must obtain various licenses and approvals from additional municipalities and provinces within China if it is to continue to expand its direct selling business model in China. As of the date of this Annual Report, BabyCare has been granted licenses to engage in direct selling in the municipalities and provinces of Beijing, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Tianjin. In 2016, BabyCare received preliminary approval from the Chinese government to expand its direct selling business into eight additional provinces and municipalities and, up to 2019, Babycare had been working to obtain the final approval for these additional provinces. However, as a result of the government's suspension of the direct selling authorization review process as part of its 2019 review of the industry, we now believe that BabyCare will not be issued the final direct selling approvals for any of these additional provinces and municipalities and will need to reapply for these approvals if and when the Chinese government again begins accepting direct selling authorization applications. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Chinese government has not indicated when or if it will reopen the authorization review process for new direct selling licenses or how previously-filed applications will be handled if the process is reopened. Due to the unpredictability created by these events, and the discretion maintained by the Chinese government, there is no guarantee that BabyCare will be able to successfully reapply for these approvals or that the Chinse government will ultimately grant BabyCare a direct sales license in these or in other jurisdictions, either of which could delay or adversely affect BabyCare’s growth and business.
 
Direct selling companies, and the industry in general, continue to experience significant media and public scrutiny. Several companies similar to USANA recently have been scrutinized and penalized in several markets where we operate, including the United States, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea. This scrutiny, along with the uncertainty of the laws and regulations pertaining to direct selling in many countries, can affect how a regulator or member of the public, including investors, perceives us. For instance, there has been significant media and short-seller attention given to the viability and legality of direct selling in the United States and China over the past few years. This attention has led to intense public scrutiny of our industry, as well as volatility in our stock price and the stock prices of other direct selling companies who operate in the same markets. We cannot predict the impact that this scrutiny may have on our business or industry in the future.
 
We detail more of the various risks associated with the regulation of our overall business, direct selling business model and Compensation Plan in this Annual Report in “
