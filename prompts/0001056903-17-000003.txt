AWR makes its periodic reports, Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and current reports, Form 8-K, available free of charge through its website, www.aswater.com, as soon as material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such reports are also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. AWR also makes available free of charge its code of business conduct and ethics, its corporate governance guidelines and the charters of its Board of Directors, Nominating and Governance Committee, Compensation Committee, and Audit and Finance Committee through its website or by calling (800) 999-4033. AWR and GSWC have filed the certification of officers required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Overview

AWR is the parent company of GSWC and American States Utility Services, Inc. (“ASUS”) (and its wholly owned subsidiaries Fort Bliss Water Services Company (“FBWS”), Terrapin Utility Services, Inc. (“TUS”), Old Dominion Utility Services, Inc. (“ODUS”), Palmetto State Utility Services, Inc. (“PSUS”), Old North Utility Services, Inc. (“ONUS”) and Emerald Coast Utility Services, Inc. ("ECUS")). AWR was incorporated as a California corporation in 1998 as a holding company.  AWR has three reportable segments: water, electric and contracted services. Within the segments, AWR has two principal business units, water and electric service utility operations, conducted through GSWC, and contracted services conducted through ASUS and its subsidiaries. FBWS, TUS, ODUS, PSUS, ONUS and ECUS may be referred to herein collectively as the “Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.”

GSWC is a public utility engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of water in 10 counties in the State of California.  GSWC is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”).  It was incorporated as a California corporation on December 31, 1929. GSWC also distributes electricity in several San Bernardino County mountain communities in California through its Bear Valley Electric Service (“BVES”) division.

GSWC served 261,002 water customers and 23,940 electric customers at December 31, 2016, or a total of 284,942 customers, compared with 260,151 water customers and 23,846 electric customers at December 31, 2015, or a total of 283,997 customers. GSWC’s operations exhibit seasonal trends. Although GSWC’s water utility operations have a diversified customer base, residential and commercial customers account for the majority of GSWC’s water sales and revenues. Revenues derived from commercial and residential water customers accounted for approximately 90% of total water revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

ASUS, itself or through the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, has contracted with the U.S. government to provide water and/or wastewater services at various military installations. ASUS operates, maintains and performs construction activities (including renewal and replacement capital work) on water and/or wastewater systems at various United States military bases pursuant to 50-year firm, fixed-price contracts.  Each of the contracts with the U.S. government is subject to termination, in whole or in part, prior to the end of its 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract. The contract price for each of these contracts is subject to either (i) redetermination every three years following the initial two years of the contract or (ii) annually under an economic price adjustment. Contracts are also subject to equitable price adjustments and modifications for changes in circumstances, changes in laws and regulations, additions to the contract value for new construction of facilities at the military bases and changes in wages and fringe benefits to the extent provided in the contract.  AWR guarantees performance of ASUS’s military privatization contracts.
Pursuant to the terms of these contracts, the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries operate the following water and wastewater systems:


• | FBWS - water and wastewater systems at Fort Bliss located near El Paso, Texas and extending into southeastern New Mexico;


• | TUS - water and wastewater systems at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland;

3


• | ODUS - wastewater system at Fort Lee in Virginia and the water and wastewater systems at Joint-Base Langley Eustis and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story in Virginia (“TRADOC”);


• | PSUS - water and wastewater systems at Fort Jackson in South Carolina;


• | ONUS - water and wastewater systems at Fort Bragg, Pope Army Airfield and Camp Mackall, North Carolina; and


• | ECUS - water and wastewater systems at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida expected to begin operation in the spring of 2017 pursuant to a contract awarded in July 2016.


Certain financial information for each of AWR’s business segments - water distribution, electric distribution, and contracted services - is set forth in Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of American States Water Company and its subsidiaries. AWR’s water and electric distribution segments are not dependent upon a single or only a few customers.  The U.S. government is the primary customer for ASUS’s contracted services.  ASUS, from time to time, performs work at military bases for other prime contractors of the U.S. government.

The revenue from AWR’s segments is seasonal. The impact of seasonality on these AWR businesses is discussed in more detail in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Environmental matters and compliance with such laws and regulations are discussed in detail in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the section titled “Environmental Matters.”

Competition

The businesses of GSWC are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories.  However, GSWC may be subject to eminent domain proceedings in which governmental agencies, under state law, may acquire GSWC’s water systems if doing so is necessary and in the public’s interest. GSWC competes with governmental agencies and other investor-owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms, availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis. ASUS actively competes for business with other investor-owned utilities, other third party providers of water and/or wastewater services and governmental entities primarily on the basis of quality of service and price.

AWR Workforce

AWR and its subsidiaries had a total of 736 employees as of January 31, 2017.  GSWC had 563 employees as of January 31, 2017.  Fourteen employees of BVES are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which expires in December 2017.  

ASUS had 173 employees as of January 31, 2017.  Sixteen of FBWS's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers. This agreement expires in September 2017.

• | our electric division's ability to comply with the CPUC’s renewable energy procurement requirements;


• | changes in GSWC long-term customer demand due to changes in customer usage patterns as a result of conservation efforts, regulatory changes affecting demand such as mandatory restrictions on water use, new landscaping or irrigation requirements, recycling of water by customers or purchase of recycled water supplied by other parties, unanticipated population growth or decline, changes in climate conditions, general economic and financial market conditions and cost increases, which may impact our long-term operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases, if growth in the residential customer base does not occur to the extent necessary to offset the decline in per-customer residential usage or GSWC's customer base declines as a result of condemnation actions or the use of recycled or reclaimed water from other third-party sources;
