ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. (the "registrant" or "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota in November 1990 under the name Fonahome Corporation. On March 24, 2009, the Company reincorporated in the state of Nevada and merged with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fona, Inc., adopting the surviving company’s name, Fona, Inc. and simultaneously adopted the capital structure of Fona Inc., which includes total authorized capital stock of 800,000,000 shares, of which 780,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are blank check preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series with such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolutions adopted by the Corporation’s Board providing for the issuance of such preferred stock or series thereof.
 
On June 6, 2014, Evolutionary Genomics, Inc., a Delaware corporation merged with Fona, Inc. treated as a reverse acquisition with Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. as the acquirer and Fona as the acquired party. Subsequent to the Merger, Fona, Inc. was renamed Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. and our subsidiary was renamed from Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. to EG Crop Science, Inc. On May 9, 2016, we formed ICAM Therapeutics, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) as a wholly owned subsidiary of Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. We have not incurred any transactions in this company nor have we established any business plan for the future.
 
The Company maintains headquarters at the office of its Chief Executive Officer. The Company maintains a website at www.evolgen.com. The Company is not required to deliver an annual report to security holders and at this time does not anticipate the distribution of such a report. The Company will file reports with the SEC.
 
On August 14, 2000, the Company was issued patent number 6274319, titled “Methods to identify evolutionarily significant changes in polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences in domestic plants and animals”. On June 1, 2004, the Company was issued patent number 6743580, titled “Methods for producing transgenic plants containing evolutionarily significant polynucleotides”. These patents are for the core Adapted Traits Platform that we use for the discovery of genes in humans, animals and commercial crops. The Company has applied the Adapted Traits Platform in research projects including identifying genes believed to be responsible for increases in yield in corn, increases in yield in rice, salt tolerance and sugar content in tomatoes and pest/disease resistance in soybeans, bananas and multiple other crops.
 
Advances in genetic research and modification of crop species have led to increased yield, drought tolerance and disease/pest resistance. In addition, mergers and consolidation within the industry has led to fewer competitors among the seed and production companies. The largest companies control much of the implementation of new plant varieties through patents and licensing agreements. Genetic traits providers, like Evolutionary Genomics, identify and develop genes that impact traits of interest to the industry and market those genes to these companies.

EG Technology – The Adapted Traits Platform (“ATP’)
 
Genomics research generates vast amounts of sequence data for thousands of genes. Some companies use this sequence data to try to predict the function of each gene and its potential to impact key traits. Others try to match the thousands of random deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) changes between individuals with differences in traits. Evolutionary Genomics’ approach is to first narrow the search to genes that have undergone adaptive evolution (positively selected genes) in an organism that has an adapted trait of potential commercial value. To identify genes with impact on commercially desirable traits, Evolutionary Genomics screens first for positively selected genes. Evolutionary Genomics then focuses functional genomics efforts on demonstrating the effects of these genes on the desired traits.
 
Evolutionary Genomics uses the Adapted Traits Platform to perform high throughput molecular evolution analysis to identify positively selected genes based on Ka/Ks analysis (as defined below). Ka/Ks analysis was developed to document the role of positive selection on known protein coding genes. Molecular-level adaptive evolution is indicated when comparisons of homologous protein coding sequences from closely related species show that the number of amino acid differences fixed due to selection exceeds what can be expected by neutral evolution. Molecular-level positive selection can be detected in protein-coding genes by pairwise comparisons of the ratios of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks). The algorithm, by comparing substitutions per site, takes into account, in rigorous fashion, the effect of bias and degeneracy in the genetic code, and also compensates for the effects of multiple hits at the same site. Ka/Ks ratios significantly greater than unity strongly suggest that positive selection has fixed greater numbers of amino acid replacements than can be expected as a result of chance alone.
 
Dr. Walter Messier, a Company founder and our Chief Science Officer, published a seminal paper in the field: Messier and Stewart (1997) “Episodic adaptive evolution of primate lysozymes” Nature 385:151-154. The work described in this publication demonstrated that a known lysozyme gene that had been recruited for a new function to aid in digestion of leaves as a food source in certain monkeys had the kind of adaptive genetic changes indicating that the lysozyme gene had evolved more rapidly than the neutral substitution rate, indicating Darwinian positive selection. Many groups have used such methods to document Darwinian positive selection in other proteins. It was Dr. Messier’s insight that genes controlling a trait of interest could be identified by using molecular evolution analysis as a screen, comparing genes in a species with a trait to genes of a closely related species lacking the trait. The adapted genes found in such a screen could then be validated to determine their role in the presence or absence of the trait of interest.
 
Business Model
 
Evolutionary Genomics’ primary source of revenue through March 31, 2020 had been contract services revenue for research performed by Evolutionary Genomics on behalf of other commercial entities and grant income received from governmental agencies, industry associations and grant making foundations for research performed. Ownership of the intellectual property in these projects varies from Evolutionary Genomics retaining all intellectual property rights to retaining none of the developed intellectual property for the crop that is the subject of the project. In addition to contract services revenue for research, Evolutionary Genomics intends to continue to pursue grant funding from governmental agencies, industry associations and grant making foundations. These sources of funding are often subject to limitations in available funds, funding priorities in areas other than our area of focus, political uncertainties, long approval processes and competition with other research proposals.
 
The single most valuable step in the process of crop improvement is the identification of the key genes among the 30,000 or more in the genome that have the desired impact. The Company has identified pest/disease resistance genes in bananas, soybeans and other commercially valuable crops. If validation testing of these genes is successful, we will market them to the industry. This strategy requires Evolutionary Genomics to incur significant research costs prior to any confirmation of commercial viability and there can be no guarantee that the desired results can be achieved or that commercialization can be reached.
 
The goal of the grant funded research projects was to discover genetic intellectual properties with commercial value. Evolutionary Genomics’ soybean pest resistance project is a multiple year illustration of the evolution of a project from concept through marketing to seed companies. The project has yielded identified genes for pest resistance in soybeans with partial validation complete. Evolutionary Genomics has partially completed two generation, whole plant validation testing but has decided to postpone further testing indefinitely to focus resources on our banana project. The Company has extended this soybean pest resistance research to other crops including beans, tomatoes, cotton and maize and has identified candidate genes. Further research on these crops is dependent on revenue from our banana project or additional capital funding. If we are able to complete additional validation testing, we intend to market these genes to the seed industry.

Our banana pest resistance project is another project illustration. We identified a gene (FusR1) in bananas that appears to confer resistance to Fusarium Fungus which leads to Panama Disease. We marketed the gene to banana companies and, in August 2020, executed a Development and Commercialization Agreement (“DCA”) with Dole Food Company (“Dole”) which includes development work funded by Dole and the framework for a long-term licensing relationship. While Dole is supplying significant funding for the development of this banana gene in the form of promissory notes, there can be no assurance that this development work will lead to licensing revenue as there are many risks involved in genetic trait development.
 
Licensing revenue can be lump sum payments, milestone payments upon achievement of defined goals and/or percentages of revenue for products sold by licensee. These payments are often many years after completion of gene identification project as licensees engage in significant additional testing including field trials prior to integration into licensee commercial germplasm lines. There can be no guarantee that these licensing agreements will result in any additional revenue for Evolutionary Genomics as further development of licensed intellectual property is mostly controlled by the licensee.
 
Evolutionary Genomics’ Banana Project
 
During the 1950s the global banana industry was devastated by a disease (caused by Fusarium fungus) that effectively wiped out the predominate variety of commercial bananas know as Gros Michel leading to the development of the Cavendish banana, which makes up well over 90% of the commercial banana market today. Cavendish was resistant to the strain of Fusarium that wiped out the Gros Michel variety but, in recent years, is being challenged by a new race of Fusarium that threatens to, once again, devastate the global banana industry. The recent emergence of TR4 Panama Disease in the Western Hemisphere makes a swift solution to the crisis even more urgent. A substantial part of the banana market consists of exports from Central and South America to the United States.
 
In 2018, the Company began a project to identify genes in wild banana relatives that are resistant to Fusarium. We have previously used our technology to identify genes in common beans and, in our project for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in common beans, proved that these genes provided increased resistance to Fusarium fungus. We used our platform to isolate a banana gene that controls Fusarium Wilt (FW), aka Panama Disease, Tropical Race 4. The gene, which we have named FusR1 (Fusarium Resistance 1), is a native gene in Musa species, including cultivated bananas. We have found that, for all FW-resistant banana cultivars/species that we have tested, one version of our gene exists while, in all FW-sensitive banana cultivars/species that we have tested, there is a different version of FusR1. And notably, a third version exists in semi-resistant varieties that has allowed us to identify the particular nucleotide changes that are crucial for resistance to Fusarium Wilt.
 
We have successfully introduced FusR1 into cultivated bananas using a gene transformation approach in a project at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. Of the transformed events that were produced in the transformation stage, roughly half survived to the testable stage and we have been testing those events for Fusarium resistance over the last several months. Through the date of this report roughly half of those testable events remain untested, one-quarter were discarded as being susceptible and one-quarter have shown some resistance to Fusarium. We expect to receive additional test results over the next three months that may eliminate some of the events that have shown promise and/or may reveal additional events with promise.
 
The testing to date has included one to six plants per event which is not enough to advance to commercial production. We have begun replication of the promising events for field trials which will likely take 2-1/2 to 3 years to complete. In addition to testing for Fusarium resistance, plants will be observed for any changes in other traits such as fruit yield or taste. Many others are working on potential genetic and/or traditional breeding solutions. There can be no assurance that any of these events will result in plants that can be advanced for commercial production or that we can be competitive with solutions provided by others.
 
We believe that, given the threat of possible extinction for Cavendish, rapid approaches are not only warranted but essential and minimally genetically edited bananas will be accepted depending upon how the gene transfer is accomplished. Transfer of this native banana gene to cultivated bananas can also be accomplished with CRISPR technology, which allows a targeted, gene transfer and which, as compared to more traditional genetic editing techniques, minimizes potential side effects. We believe that Cavendish bananas can be rendered Fusarium Wilt resistant by changing only a few base pairs. These sorts of minimal changes have been allowed by the USDA and FDA in several crops. Even in Europe, use of CRISPR technology has gained some traction. To date, we have not used the CRISPR approach to produce resistant plants.

On June 26, 2019, we filed a United States patent application titled IDENTIFICATION AND RESISTANCE GENES FROM WILD RELATIVES OF BANANA AND THEIR USES IN CONTROLLING PANAMA DISEASE. We are awaiting review of these patents by the United States Patent Office. During 2021 and 2022, we filed patents in Europe, Africa, South and Central America, Australia and Asia and are awaiting review of those as well.
 
On August 19, 2020, the Company entered into a Development and Commercialization Agreement (“DCA”) with Dole Food Company for the development of plant varieties within the Musa genus of the Musaceae family (including the Cavendish variety of banana) that exhibit resistance to Fusarium Wilt Tropical Race 4 (popularly known as Panama Disease). Subject to compliance with various provisions of the agreement, the agreement includes partial working capital funding from Dole to the Company through 2024. In addition to working capital funding, Dole reimburses the Company for the development of banana plants and Dole will incur additional costs for the commercialization of plants upon successful completion of the development portion of this project. From the effective date of the agreement, the Company has received $1,600,000 of working capital funding and $1,943,747 of development costs pursuant to this agreement in the form of promissory notes. Per the Agreement, 50% of future royalties may be offset with the research funding provided by Dole. In the event that Dole terminates the agreement for material breach by the Company or the Company’s bankruptcy, the Company must repay all funding provided by Dole within six months of termination. The parties have agreed to negotiate the terms of the long-term license agreement upon successful completion of the development portion of this project.
 
Upon successful completion of validation testing and field trials by Dole, under the terms of the agreement with Dole, we expect to negotiate a long-term royalty contract for the commercialization of banana plants using our genes. This licensing arrangement will likely be exclusively with Dole and contain royalty payments based on the number of plants and/or hectares of plants. Even if EG’s genes are proven to be effective, it is difficult to predict the future revenue stream that any licensing arrangement can generate and will be heavily dependent upon the speed with which Panama Disease spreads throughout the world necessitating a solution and any changes in the price of bananas based on supply and demand. Many articles are available in the public realm detailing the significance of the disease and the spread throughout the world.
 
Since bananas are seedless, they are propagated by clones which allows for very rapid production of plants. An initial batch of 100 successful plants can generate a secondary propagation of over 15,000 plants in one year (enough for 10 hectares) and 15 million in the next generation. There are over 400,000 hectares of banana production in Latin America from Mexico to Peru. Adoption of the new variety will be dependent upon its effectiveness and the infection rate of Panama disease.
 
There are many risks associated with achieving these desired results including but not limited to:
 

- | We may not be able to adequately establish patent protection for our intellectual property or others may have competing claims.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Others may develop competitive approaches to compete with our genes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Our genes may cause unforeseen and undesirable changes beyond the pest resistance such as yield degradation or changes in the appearance or taste of the fruit.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Our genes may fail to deliver the desired results of resistance to Fusarium.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Global regulations and/or consumer preference may prevent the successful commercial launch of bananas with genetics changed using our methods.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We will be dependent on others for the successful production and marketing of bananas with our genes and many factors will be outside of our control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Our expected future royalty revenue will be highly dependent upon the successful execution of the banana development project in the DCA with Dole and the negotiation of a long-term royalty licensing agreement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While Panama Disease 1) is potentially existential to the banana industry, 2) has no known treatment and 3) is not yet widespread, Black Sigatoka Disease is a different disease that is very wide-spread and is treated with toxins at a cost of up to $2,300 per hectare per year. We spent the last two years researching wild banana plants to identify a gene that could potentially be used to develop plants that are resistant to Black Sigatoka with no or reduced use of toxins. We are in the early stages of developing this gene and others are working on competing approaches. There is no guarantee that this will lead to commercial success. Like our FusR1 project, transformation and validation can be very expensive and, if we do not receive licensing revenue from our FusR1 gene, we will need funding from either grants or potential customers or additional capital from investors, none of which can be assured.

Evolutionary Genomics’ Soybean Project
 
On April 29, 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patent 8,710,300 titled EXPRESSION OF DIRIGENT GENE EG261 AND ITS ORTHOLOGS AND PARALOGS ENHANCES PATHOGEN RESISTANCE IN PLANTS. On December 5, 2017 and March 3, 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued additional patents which extended the previous patent to include additional variations of the gene. We have filed additional patents in multiple countries that are at various stages of processing. On January 18, 2022, the Company filed a patent application on its second soybean pest/disease resistance gene, EG19, and has included that gene in its ongoing two generation, whole plant validation research. The Company has also discovered additional candidate genes that may impact pathogen resistance. There can be no assurance that any of these genes will be proven effective in validation testing or lead to licensing agreements or revenue.
 
We entered into a Service Agreement with the Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center (“WCIC”) under which they have transformed soybeans using our genes and helped to establish the right combinations to achieve a range of expression. WCIC grew events from seven constructs of EG261 and EG19 in their greenhouses. The testing of these T2 generation seedlings at the University of Missouri is partially complete but we have indefinitely suspended work on these genes to focus our resources on our banana projects. If we resume these projects and results from the whole plant validation trials confirm the findings of the University of Wisconsin-Madison for EG261 and the effectiveness of the new gene, EG19, the Company intends to enter negotiations for a long-term research collaboration and licensing agreement with seed companies. The testing phase includes field trials which may proceed for several years prior to generating licensing revenue. There are many risks in this process including some that are outside of Evolutionary Genomics’ control and there can be no guarantee that we will ever generate any revenue from these potential agreements.
 
Competition
 
Evolutionary Genomics’ competition is very broad from the largest seed companies and producing companies to the smallest grower who is successful in breeding new, improved varieties. These same competitors are also Evolutionary Genomics customers as we seek to license intellectual property for commercialization into their production lines. Many of these companies are exponentially larger with many more resources at their disposal and there can be no assurance that EG can continue to compete with them or interest them in licensing our intellectual property.

Material Agreements
 
Effective March 1, 2012, Evolutionary Genomics entered into an Agreement for Contract Services with Smith Bucklin Corporation (the “Contractor”) on behalf of the United Soybean Board. The contract includes the payment of certain royalties, as defined in the Agreement. Evolutionary Genomics retains all ownership of patents and intellectual property developed in the project and is obligated to pay royalties to the United Soybean Board of ten percent of the sale of products derived from the soybean genes that were the subject of the research performed or from royalties received from the sale of products by a third party not to exceed 150% of the total amount paid to Evolutionary Genomics under this Agreement. Evolutionary Genomics recognized revenue of $262,400 from this contract, thus limiting any future royalties to a total of $393,600. The project term has expired but the royalty provisions remain in perpetuity.
 
On February 21, 2015 the Company entered into the Sponsored Research Contract with The Curators of the University of Missouri for phenotyping of transgenic soybean samples on a per unit basis. We expect to continue this contract and will likely have additional amounts payable but the amount is indeterminable. Evolutionary Genomics retains sole ownership of all patents and intellectual property, royalty free for all materials (including previously identified genes) related to this project.
 
On August 19, 2020, the Company entered into the DCA with Dole for the development of our banana genes. The DCA provides for payments from Dole to the Company of $800,000 upon execution, $800,000 by the twelve-month anniversary, $250,000 by the thirty-six month anniversary and $250,000 by the forty-eight month anniversary. Dole will also reimburse the Company for costs incurred at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (“UW”) not to exceed $2,200,000 in coordination with the Standard Research Agreement that the Company entered into with UW on September 18, 2020 which includes payments from the Company to UW in the amount of $2,159,719 over the two-year expected term of the project. If the UW research is successful, Dole expects to incur costs of $750,000 to perform field trials.
 
The DCA also specifies that the Company will execute notes payable to Dole for the funding that Dole is providing up to $5,050,000. 
Through December 31, 2021, the Company executed notes for $800,000, $800,000, $1,295,831 and $647,916 under this DCA and recorded them as a long-term notes payable for financial statement purposes. There were no new notes in the year ended December 31, 2022. The notes are non-interest bearing and allow Dole to offset fifty percent of future royalty payments to the Company by reducing the amount of principal due on these notes. Other than this offset of future royalty payments, repayment of principal and interest is only required in the case of termination of the DCA by Dole for cause.
 
On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a Standard Research Agreement with WCIC for the development of our banana genes. The agreement includes payments from the Company in the amount of $2,159,719 over the two-year expected term of the project. These costs will be reimbursed, in the form of notes payable by Dole in accordance with our DCA. 

 
The Company entered into a Service Agreement with WCIC for the maintenance and shipment of banana plants which includes unit pricing for services rendered and is expected to be completed by March 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $59,330 of cost was incurred under this contract and was reimbursed by Dole.
 
On April 18, 2022, the Company entered into a Service Agreement with the University of Wisconsin-Madison for the testing of banana plants which includes payments of $143,124 of which $128,811 were paid in the year ended December 31, 2022 and reimbursed by Dole.
