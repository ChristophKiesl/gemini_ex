Item 1 – Business

OVERVIEW
DPL is a regional energy company incorporated in 1985 under the laws of Ohio. All of DPL’s stock is owned by an AES subsidiary.
DPL has three primary subsidiaries: DP&L, MVIC and Miami Valley Lighting. DP&L, which also does business as AES Ohio, is a public utility providing electric transmission and distribution services in West Central Ohio. For additional information, see Note 1 – Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 1 – Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements. All of DPL's subsidiaries are wholly-owned. DPL manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment. See Note 13 – Business Segments of the Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding DPL’s reportable segment. DP&L also manages its business through one reportable operating segment, the Utility segment.
As an electric public utility in Ohio, DP&L provides regulated transmission and distribution services to its customers as well as retail SSO electric service. DP&L's sales reflect the general economic conditions, seasonal weather patterns and the growth of energy efficiency initiatives; however, our distribution revenues were decoupled from weather and energy efficiency variations from January 1, 2019 through December 18, 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, DP&L filed a petition to continue to accrue the impacts of decoupling for recovery through a future rate proceeding, but it is unknown at this time how the PUCO will rule on that petition. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements for further information.
DPL’s other primary subsidiaries are MVIC and Miami Valley Lighting. MVIC is our captive insurance company that provides insurance services to DP&L and our other subsidiaries, and Miami Valley Lighting provides street and outdoor lighting services to customers in the Dayton region.
DPL also has a wholly-owned business trust, DPL Capital Trust II, formed for the purpose of issuing trust capital securities to investors.
DP&L does not have any subsidiaries.
DP&L’s electric transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators. Accordingly, DP&L applies the accounting standards for regulated operations to its electric transmission and distribution businesses and records regulatory assets when incurred costs are expected to be recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities when current cost recoveries in customer rates relate to expected future costs or overcollections of riders.
GENERATING CAPACITY
DPL, through AES Ohio Generation, owned an undivided interest in Conesville. AES Ohio Generation's share of this EGU's capacity was 129 MW. AES Ohio Generation sold all of its energy and capacity into the wholesale market. AEP Generation, the operator of the co-owned Conesville EGU, closed Unit 4 in May 2020, and AES Ohio Generation's interest in this EGU was sold in June 2020. For additional information on this event and DPL's other previously owned EGUs, see Note 15 – Discontinued Operations of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements.
DP&L also has a 4.9% interest in OVEC, an electric generating company. OVEC has two electric generating stations located in Cheshire, Ohio and Madison, Indiana with a combined generation capacity of 2,109 MW. DP&L’s share of this generation capacity is 103 MW.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
DPL's employees are essential to delivering and maintaining reliable service to our customers. DPL and its subsidiaries employed 631 people (512 full-time) at January 31, 2021 all of which were employed by DP&L. Approximately 58% of all DPL employees are under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 31, 2023.
Safety
As part of AES, safety is one of our core values. Ensuring safe operations at our facilities, so each person can return home safely, is the cornerstone of our daily activities and decisions. Safety efforts are led globally by the AES Chief Operating Officer and supported by safety committees that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety.
We work with the Safety Management System (“SMS”), a Global Safety Standard that applies to all AES employees and employees of AES subsidiaries, as well as contractors working in AES facilities and construction projects. The SMS requires continuous safety performance monitoring, risk assessment and performance of periodic integrated environmental, health and safety audits. The SMS provides a consistent framework for all AES operational businesses and construction projects to set expectations for risk identification and reduction, measure performance and drive continuous improvements. The SMS standard is consistent with the OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 standard. Our safety performance is also measured by both leading and lagging metrics. Our leading safety metrics track safety observations, safety meeting engagement and the reporting of non-injury near misses. Our lagging safety metrics track lost workday cases, severity rate, and recordable incidents. We are committed to excellence in safety and have implemented various programs to increase safety awareness and improve work practices.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having employees work from home to the extent they were able, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
Talent
We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We have a comprehensive approach to managing our talent and developing our leaders in order to ensure our people have the right skills for today and tomorrow whether that requires us to build new business models or leverage leading technologies.
We emphasize employee development and training. To empower employees, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful by focusing on experience and exposure as well as formal programs including our AES' ACE Academy for Talent Development, and our Trainee Program.
We believe that our individual differences make us stronger. Our Global Diversity and Inclusion Program is led by the AES Diversity and Inclusion Officer. Governance and standards are guided by the AES Chief Human Resources Officer, with input from members of AES' Executive Leadership Team.
Compensation
Our compensation philosophy emphasizes pay-for-performance. Our incentive plans are designed to reward strong performance, with greater compensation paid when performance exceeds expectations and less compensation paid when performance falls below expectations. We invest significant time and resources to ensure our compensation programs are competitive and reward the performance of our people. Every year, our people who are not part of a collective bargaining agreement are eligible for an annual merit-based salary increase. In addition, individuals are eligible for a salary increase if they receive a significant promotion. For non-collectively bargained employees at certain levels in the organization we offer annual incentives (bonus) and long-term compensation to reinforce the alignment between employees and AES.
SERVICE COMPANY
The Service Company provides services including operations, accounting, legal, human resources, information technology and other corporate services on behalf of companies that are part of the U.S. SBU, including, among other companies, DPL and DP&L. The Service Company allocates the costs for these services based on cost drivers designed to result in fair and equitable allocations. This includes ensuring that the regulated utilities served, including DP&L, are not subsidizing costs incurred for the benefit of other businesses. See Note 12 – Related Party Transactions of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 12 – Related Party Transactions of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
SEASONALITY
The power delivery business is seasonal, and weather patterns have a material effect on energy demand. In the region we serve, demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and in the winter months associated with heating compared to other times of the year. DP&L's sales typically reflect the seasonal weather patterns and the growth of energy efficiency initiatives. However, the impacts of weather, energy efficiency programs and economic changes in customer demand were almost entirely eliminated in 2019 by DP&L’s Decoupling Rider, which was in place from January 1, 2019 until December 18, 2019. DP&L has requested authority from the PUCO to create a regulatory asset for the ongoing revenues that would have been charged in the Decoupling Rider going back to December 18, 2019. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
Storm activity can also have an adverse effect on our operating performance. Severe storms often damage transmission and distribution equipment, thereby causing power outages, which reduce revenues and increase repair costs. Partially mitigating this impact is DP&L’s ability to timely recover certain O&M repair costs related to severe storms.
MARKET STRUCTURE
Retail rate regulation
DP&L's distribution service to all retail customers as well as the provisions of its SSO service are regulated by the PUCO. In addition, certain costs are considered to be non-bypassable and are therefore assessed to all DP&L retail customers, under the regulatory authority of the PUCO, regardless of the customer’s retail electric supplier. DP&L's transmission rates are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act.
Ohio law establishes the process for determining SSO and non-bypassable rates charged by public utilities. Regulation of retail rates encompasses the timing of applications, the effective date of rate changes, the cost basis upon which the rates are set and other service-related matters. Ohio law also established the Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, which has the authority to represent residential consumers in state and federal judicial and administrative rate proceedings.
Ohio legislation extends the jurisdiction of the PUCO to the records and accounts of certain public utility holding company systems, including DPL. The legislation extends the PUCO's supervisory powers to a holding company system's general condition and capitalization, among other matters, to the extent that such matters relate to the costs associated with the provision of public utility service. Based on existing PUCO and FERC authorization, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded on the balance sheets of both DPL and DP&L. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
COMPETITION AND REGULATION
Ohio Retail Rates
DP&L rates for electric service currently remain the lowest among Ohio investor-owned utilities.
ESP 1 established DP&L's framework for providing retail service on a going-forward basis including rate structures, non-bypassable charges and other specific rate recovery true-up rider mechanisms. For more information regarding DP&L's ESP, see Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
On September 26, 2018, the PUCO issued the DRO establishing new base distribution rates for DP&L, which became effective October 1, 2018. The DRO approved, without modification, a stipulation and recommendation previously filed by DP&L, along with various intervening parties and the PUCO staff. The DRO established a revenue requirement of $248.0 million for DP&L's electric service base distribution rates. The DRO also provided for a return on equity of 9.999% and a cost of long-term debt of 4.8%.
On November 30, 2020, DP&L filed a new distribution rate case with the PUCO. This rate case proposes a revenue increase of $120.8 million. For more information, see Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
In December 2018, DP&L filed its Smart Grid Plan with the PUCO proposing to invest $576.0 million in capital projects over the next 10 years. There are eight principal components of DP&L’s Smart Grid Plan: 1) Smart Meters, 2) Self-Healing Grid, 3) Customer Engagement, 4) Enhancing Sustainability and Embracing Innovation. 5) Telecommunications, 6) Physical and Cyber Security, 7) Governance and Analytics and 8) Grid Modernization R&D. On October 23, 2020 DP&L filed a comprehensive settlement (the “Settlement”) with the PUCO that, among other matters, includes resolution of this Smart Grid application. If approved, DP&L plans to implement the plan that will deliver benefits to customers, society as a whole and to DP&L. For more information, see Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
Ohio law and the PUCO rules contain targets relating to renewable energy standards. DP&L is currently in full compliance with renewable energy standards. DP&L recovers the costs of its compliance with Ohio renewable energy standards through a separate rider which is reviewed and audited by the PUCO.
The costs associated with providing high voltage transmission service and wholesale electric sales and ancillary services are subject to FERC jurisdiction. DP&L implemented a formula-based rate for its transmission service, effective May 3, 2020. For more information, see Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
As a member of PJM, DP&L receives revenues from the RTO related to DP&L’s transmission assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers. Ohio law includes a provision that would allow Ohio electric utilities to seek and obtain a reconcilable rider to recover RTO-related costs and credits. DP&L continues to recover non-market-based transmission and ancillary costs through its nonbypassable Transmission Cost Recovery Rider.
In response to filings made by DP&L and AES Ohio Generation, the FERC approved on May 16, 2017 reactive power rates for the generation facilities that were owned at that time.  In the same order, FERC referred to the FERC’s Office of Enforcement for investigation, an issue regarding DP&L’s reactive power charges under the previously effective rates in light of changes in DP&L’s generation portfolio between cases.   As of the date of this report, DP&L is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the investigation.  Several other utilities within PJM are also being investigated by FERC’s Office of Enforcement with respect to the same issue of changes in the generation portfolio that occurred in between rate proceedings.
DP&L is also subject to an annual retrospective SEET threshold whereby it must demonstrate its return on equity is not significantly excessive. This review for 2018, 2019 and the ESP v. MRO and prospective SEET are all part of the Settlement. This Settlement is pending review by the PUCO and, depending on the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of 
Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 – Regulatory Matters of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements.
Ohio Competition
Since January 2001, DP&L’s electric customers have been permitted to choose their retail electric generation supplier. DP&L continues to have the exclusive right to provide delivery service in its state-certified territory and the obligation to procure and provide electricity to SSO customers that do not choose an alternative supplier. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over DP&L’s delivery of electricity, SSO and other retail electric services.
As part of Ohio’s electric deregulation law, all of the state’s investor-owned utilities were required to join an RTO. DP&L is a member of the PJM RTO. The role of the RTO is to administer a competitive wholesale market for electricity and ensure reliability of the transmission grid. PJM ensures the reliability of the high-voltage electric power system serving more than 65 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. PJM coordinates and directs the operation of the region’s transmission grid, administers the world’s largest competitive wholesale electricity market and plans regional transmission expansion improvements to maintain grid reliability and relieve congestion.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
DPL’s and DP&L's current and former facilities and operations are and/or were subject to a wide range of federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. The environmental issues that may affect us are discussed below. 
•The federal CAA and state laws and regulations (including SIPs) which require compliance, obtaining permits and reporting as to air emissions;
•Litigation with federal and certain state governments and certain special interest groups regarding whether modifications to or maintenance of certain coal-fired generating stations require additional permitting or pollution control technology, or whether emissions from coal-fired generating stations cause or contribute to global climate changes;
•Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities that require or will require substantial reductions in SO2, particulates, mercury, acid gases, NOx and other air emissions;
•Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities that require or will require reporting and reductions of GHGs;
•Rules and future rules issued by the USEPA, the Ohio EPA or other authorities associated with the federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits; and
•Solid and hazardous waste laws and regulations, which govern the management and disposal of certain waste.
In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, environmental laws, rules and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. In the normal course of business, we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at our facilities to comply, or to determine compliance, with such laws, rules and regulations. We record liabilities for loss contingencies related to environmental matters when a loss is probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with the provisions of GAAP. Accordingly, we have immaterial accruals for loss contingencies for environmental matters. We also have a number of environmental matters for which we have not accrued loss contingencies because the risk of loss is not probable, or a loss cannot be reasonably estimated. We evaluate the potential liability related to environmental matters quarterly and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We have several pending environmental matters associated with our previously-owned and operated coal-fired generation units. We do not expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Note 11 – Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies – "Environmental Matters” of Notes to DPL's Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 11 – Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies – "Environmental Matters" of Notes to DP&L's Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental risks, laws and regulations and legal proceedings to which we are and may be subject to in the future.

Biden Administration Actions Affecting Environmental Regulations
On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order (the "EO") titled “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” directing agencies to, among other tasks, review regulations issued under the previous administration to determine whether they should be suspended, revoked, or revised. As provided for by the EO, the USEPA submitted a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice seeking to obtain abeyances or stays of proceedings in pending litigation that seeks review of regulations promulgated during the Trump Administration. The Biden Administration also issued a Memorandum titled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review” directing agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing any rules until the Biden Administration has reviewed and approved those rules. These actions may have an impact on regulations that may affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
We have several pending environmental matters associated with our previously-owned and operated coal-fired generation units. We do not expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Environmental Matters Related to Air Quality
As a result of DPL’s retirement and subsequent sale of its Stuart and Killen Stations, the sale of its ownership interest in the Miami Fort and Zimmer Stations and the 2020 retirement of Conesville, followed by the sale of our interest in Conesville and our exiting of our generation business, the following environmental matters, regulations and requirements are now not expected to have a material impact on DPL:
•The CAA and the following regulations
•CSAPR and associated updates;
•MATS and any associated regulatory or judicial processes;
•NAAQS; and
•CPP or Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.
Litigation Involving Co-Owned Stations
As a result of a 2008 consent decree entered into with the Sierra Club and approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, DPL and the other owners of the Stuart Station were subject to certain specified emission targets related to NOX, SO2 and particulate matter. The consent decree also includes commitments for energy efficiency and renewable energy activities. An amendment to the consent decree was entered into and approved in 2010 to clarify how emissions would be computed during startups. Given that all of the commitments have been met and with the retirement of the Stuart Station, DPL and the other owners submitted a request for termination of the consent decree to the U.S. District Court. On July 14, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio granted the request and terminated the Consent Decree.
Notices of Violation Involving Co-Owned Units
On February 15, 2017, the USEPA issued an NOV alleging violations in opacity at the Stuart Station in 2016. Operations at the Stuart Station have ceased. Given the retirement and sale of the Stuart Station and the fact there has been no recent activity, we do not expect any further material developments regarding this NOV.
Environmental Matters Related to Water Quality, Waste Disposal and Ash Ponds
As a result of DPL’s retirement and subsequent sale of its Stuart and Killen Stations, the sale of its ownership interest in the Miami Fort and Zimmer Stations and the 2020 retirement of Conesville, followed by the sale of our interest in Conesville and our exiting of our generation business; the following environmental matters, regulations and requirements are now not expected to have a material impact on DPL with respect to these generating stations (although certain other requirements related to water quality, waste disposal and ash ponds are discussed further below):
•water intake regulations, including those finalized by the USEPA on May 19, 2014;
•revised technology-based regulations governing water discharges from steam electric generating facilities, finalized by the USEPA on November 3, 2015 (and revised on October 13, 2020) and commonly referred to as the ELG rules; and
•Clean Water Act rules for selenium.
Notice of Potential Liability for Third Party Disposal Site
In December 2003, DP&L and other parties received notices that the USEPA considered DP&L and other parties PRPs for the Tremont City Landfill site, located near Dayton, Ohio. On October 16, 2019, DP&L received another 
notice from the USEPA claiming that DP&L is a PRP for the portion of the site known as the barrel fill. While a review by DP&L of its records indicates that it did not contribute hazardous materials to the site, DP&L is currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter. If DP&L were required to contribute to the clean-up of the site, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation of Waste Disposal
In 2002, DP&L and other parties received a special notice that the USEPA considered DP&L to be a PRP for the clean-up of hazardous substances at a third-party landfill known as the South Dayton Dump (“Landfill”). Several of the parties voluntarily accepted some of the responsibility for contamination at the Landfill and, in May 2010, three of those parties, Hobart Corporation, Kelsey-Hayes Company and NCR Corporation (“PRP Group”), filed a civil complaint in Ohio federal court (the “District Court”) against DP&L and numerous other defendants, alleging that the defendants contributed to the contamination at the landfill and were liable for contribution to the PRP group for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the site.
While DP&L was able to get the initial case dismissed, the PRP Group subsequently, in 2013, entered into an additional Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (“ASAOC”) with the USEPA relating to vapor intrusion and again filed suit against DP&L and other defendants. Plaintiffs also added an additional ASAOC they entered into in 2016 pertaining to the investigation and remediation of all hazardous substances present in the Landfill - potentially including undefined areas outside the original dump footprint - to the vapor intrusion trial proceeding. The 2013 vapor intrusion ASAOC settled in early 2020, but the 2016 ASAOC remains to be adjudicated after completion of the remedial investigation feasibility study. While DP&L is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, if DP&L were required to contribute to the clean-up of the site, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Regulation of CCR
On October 19, 2015, a USEPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective (CCR Rule). The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements and post-closure care. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIIN Act"), which includes provisions to implement the CCR Rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. The USEPA has indicated that they will implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule. On February 20, 2020, the USEPA published a proposed rule to establish a federal CCR permit program that would operate in states without approved CCR permit programs. On August 28, 2020, the USEPA published final amendments to the CCR Rule titled “A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure”, which amends certain regulatory provisions that govern CCR. On November 12, 2020, the USEPA published amendments to the CCR Rule titled “A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B” and indicated that it would address this issue of beneficial use of CCR for closure of ash ponds that are subject to forced closure in a separate and future rulemaking. With the sale of our coal-fired generating stations, we expect that the impact of these regulations would be limited to our interest in OVEC.
The CCR Rule, current or proposed amendments to the CCR Rule, the results of groundwater monitoring data or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Clean Water Act - Regulation of Water Discharge
DP&L and other utilities at times have applied the Nationwide Permit 12 (NWP 12) issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) in completing transmission and distribution projects that may involve waters of the U.S. NWP 12 is the nationwide permit for Utility Line Activities, specifically those required for construction and maintenance, provided the activity does not result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the U.S. for each single and complete project.
On April 15, 2020, in a proceeding involving the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana (Montana District Court) vacated NWP 12 and enjoined its application. On April 27, 2020, the Corps moved for the Montana District Court to stay, pending appeal, those portions of the April 15, 2020 order that vacate NWP 12 and enjoin its application. In the alternative, the Corps asked the Montana District Court to stay its vacatur and injunction as they relate to anything other than the Keystone XL pipeline. On May 11, 2020, following a request from the Corps, the Montana District Court amended its order to vacate NWP 12 only for oil and gas pipeline construction projects, allowing electric utility T&D projects to continue. On May 13, the Corps appealed the 
Montana District Court decision with the Ninth Circuit Court and requested a stay. On May 28, 2020, the Ninth Circuit denied a motion to stay. On June 16, 2020, the U.S. Solicitor General, on behalf of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, filed an application with the U.S. Supreme Court asking the Court to stay the district court order that vacated and enjoined the Corps from issuing authorizations under NWP 12 as it relates to the construction of new oil and gas pipelines. On July 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the district court order, allowing the use of NWP 12 for oil and gas pipeline projects except for Keystone XL. On January 13, 2021, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rulemaking for the reissuance and modification of NWPs, including NWP 12, relating exclusively to the construction of oil or natural gas pipelines and the new NWP 57 for construction of electric or telecommunication utility lines. It is too early to determine whether future outcomes or decisions related to this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
On April 23, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the Hawaii Wildlife Fund v. County of Maui case related to whether a Clean Water Act permit is required when pollutants originate from a point source but are conveyed to navigable waters through a nonpoint source such as groundwater. The U.S. Supreme Court held that discharges to groundwater require a permit if the addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters. On December 10, 2020, the USEPA published a Notice of Availability of draft guidance memorandum addressing how the Supreme Court’s decision applies to NPDES permits. It is too early to determine whether this decision may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
