ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on January 27, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar partnering transaction with one or more businesses that we have not yet identified (a “Partnering Transaction”). Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in this report to “PHPC,” the “Company,” “us,” “our” or “we” mean Post Holdings Partnering Corporation. 
On January 27, 2021, PHPC Sponsor, LLC (our “Sponsor”) paid an aggregate of $25,000 for certain expenses on our behalf in exchange for the issuance of 11,500,000 shares of our Series F common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Founder Shares”), for a purchase price of approximately $0.002 per Founder Share. On April 8, 2021, our Sponsor surrendered 2,875,000 Founder Shares to us for no consideration resulting in an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founder Shares outstanding. As a result of such surrender, the per Founder Share purchase price increased to approximately $0.003 per share. Prior to the initial investment in us of $25,000 by our Sponsor, we had no assets, tangible or intangible.
On May 28, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering of 30,000,000 units (the “Units”) at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $300,000,000. Each Unit consists of one share of Series A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Series A common stock” and such shares, the “Public Shares”) and one-third of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Series A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Our Sponsor purchased 4,000,000 of the Units sold in our initial public offering at the offering price of $10.00 per Unit (the “Affiliated Units”). The Units, Public Shares and Public Warrants are each traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “PSPC.U”, “PSPC” and “PSPC WS”, respectively. 
On June 3, 2021, we issued an additional 4,500,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”) pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option in connection with the initial public offering. The Over-Allotment Units were priced at $10.00 per Over-Allotment Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $45,000,000. The term “IPO” as used herein generally refers to the consummation of the initial public offering on May 28, 2021 and the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option on June 3, 2021. 
On May 28, 2021, in conjunction with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated the private sale of 1,000,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit to our Sponsor, generating total gross proceeds of $10,000,000. Concurrently with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, our Sponsor purchased an additional 90,000 Private Placement Units for total gross proceeds of $900,000. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of Series A common stock (the “Private Placement Shares”) and one-third of one warrant, each whole warrant entitling our Sponsor to purchase one share of Series A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments (the “Private Placement Warrants”). The term “Private Placement” as used herein generally refers to the consummation of the private sale of Private Placement Units on May 28, 2021 and the private sale of Private Placement Units in conjunction with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units on June 3, 2021.
On May 28, 2021, we also entered into a forward purchase agreement (the “Forward Purchase Agreement”) with our Sponsor pursuant to which our Sponsor committed to purchase from us, at our election, up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units (the “Forward Purchase Units”), with each Forward Purchase Unit consisting of one share of Series B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Series B common stock” and such shares, the “Forward Purchase Shares”), and one-third of one warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock (the “Forward Purchase Warrants” and, collectively with the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants, the “Warrants”), for $10.00 per Forward Purchase Unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our Partnering Transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these Forward Purchase Units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States (the “U.S.”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (after giving effect to any redemptions of Public Shares), and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the Partnering Transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the Partnering Transaction, including funding the purchase price, paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-Partnering Transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the Trust Account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our Sponsor may purchase, at our election, less than 10,000,000 Forward Purchase Units. The terms of the Forward Purchase Warrants will generally be identical to the terms of the Public Warrants included in the Units issued in our IPO. 
Post and our Sponsor 
Our Sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post Holdings, Inc. (“Post”), a consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) holding company with a long history of value creation via strategic corporate actions and efficient capital allocation. Today, Post operates as a holding company for six distinct businesses. Four of the businesses are wholly-owned, including Post Consumer Brands, Weetabix, Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail, while two of the businesses are held as investments in non-wholly-owned subsidiaries. Post is familiar with operating as a public company with a complex organizational structure, and its operating model with its existing subsidiaries is similar to the expected relationship with our ultimate target business, making Post uniquely qualified to sponsor our business. 
Each of Post’s six businesses has its own management and operating structure, while capital allocation and mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) are centrally-managed by Post. The subsidiary businesses are unified, but not operationally integrated, by select shared services across the portfolio related to food safety, regulatory and compliance oversight; treasury; finance; investor relations; tax; select information technology; human resources; and corporate legal. Decentralization allows each business to flexibly and quickly respond to market movements and enables them to be separated in the future without significant disintegration effects or stranded costs. 
Stemming from its own strategic principles, Post could provide the following support to our ultimate target business:
•Consumer products industry expertise and relationships. Post’s management team has a collective 100+ years of industry experience in consumer products. Robert V. Vitale, our President and Chief Investment Officer and the president, chief executive officer and a board member of Post, additionally serves on the board of directors of Energizer Holdings, Inc., a publicly-traded company operating in the household products category. The management team’s relationships with business managers and operators across all corporate functions, as well as among the financial communities that invest in CPG businesses, provide the target candidate access to best-in-class leadership and strategic acumen. 
•M&A experience and capabilities, including access to deal flow. Post has completed over 20 acquisitions since 2012, building the relationships that place it at the nexus of deal flow between strategic and sponsor transactions, while developing the resources and experience to move quickly and decisively. Since future M&A opportunity is a major consideration in our selection of an ultimate target, Post is a valuable resource. 
•Tax and structuring expertise and resources. Post’s own corporate organization and transaction experience provide administrative resources and third party relationships that will help optimize corporate and deal structure. 
•Capitalization formation and ongoing balance sheet management. Post provides treasury services to its business units and its affiliate investments under master services agreements, so an extension of its guidance to our business is a natural step to leverage its expertise. Post takes a thoughtful, appropriately aggressive and proactive approach to balance sheet management, having flexed up and down leverage for acquisitions since its spin-off from Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. in 2012. 
•Experienced manager of a public company. Post management has deep expertise in leading a public company. Post intends to leverage its experience to support the target candidate as it enters the public markets for the first time. 
•Potential shared services. While we are not integrated into Post as a wholly-owned subsidiary, we anticipate having a similar relationship to Post as Post’s current subsidiaries. Post and management will take into account potential revenue and cost synergies that might be available based on common capabilities, customers, operations or distribution channels in evaluating potential partnering opportunities; Post may be able to offer certain administrative services to leverage costs across a larger portfolio. 
Post aims to help build a foundation for our long-term success, and will continue to lend us its expertise, resources and guidance as we continue on our journey as a public company. While we expect Post to provide expertise, it is not obligated to and there is no guarantee it will source a Partnering Transaction. Post will not receive any additional compensation or finder’s fees from sourcing or providing financing for our Partnering Transaction. However, as a result of Post’s indirect ownership of our Founder Shares, Affiliated Units, Private Placement Units and Forward Purchase Units, it may derive economic benefits from such securities. The amount of such economic benefits to Post cannot yet be determined. Any financing provided by Post is expected to be on terms, taken as a whole, that would be at least as favorable to us as could be obtained from a third party. 
Our Business Strategy
Our strategy is to identify, enter into a Partnering Transaction with and, after such transaction, fundamentally enhance a company by providing access to the public markets. We intend to enter into a Partnering Transaction with a company in the 
consumer products industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team and is a business to which we believe we can add value. 
Our management team is deeply familiar with the trends of our target industries and brings an investing approach that offers multiple competitive advantages in sourcing, evaluating and executing on opportunities, including: 
•Long-term investment horizon. Post’s management takes a long-term, strategic view when evaluating Post’s various operating businesses and is less concerned with seeking profits based on near-term volatility or temporary market disruptions. 
•Attractive risk-adjusted returns. We believe we can create significant value through efficient capital allocation, appropriately aggressive balance sheet management and a business model that focuses on outsized growth prospects and free cash flow generation. 
•Sophisticated transaction structuring to enhance value. We will be creative in our deal structures in order to maximize value creation for our investors and stockholders. 
•Differentiated deal sourcing across consumer sectors. Post management is at the nexus of deal flow for both strategics and sponsors. We believe that the capabilities and connections of our management team, in combination with those of Post, will continue to provide us with a differentiated pipeline of transaction opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the M&A markets to replicate. 
•Speed and agility to consummate a Partnering Transaction. Our team has proven managerial expertise in deal execution having previously acquired and divested a number of businesses. We believe that we are able to conduct candidate sourcing, screening, diligence and execution thoughtfully and efficiently as opportunities arise. 
Our Investment Criteria
We have identified general criteria and guidelines for selecting an appropriate target, which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses: 
•Fundamental business value. We look for businesses that exhibit certain attributes, such as consumer utility, strong brand awareness and unique value propositions anchored by effective distribution and solid household penetration. We are also looking for businesses that are future-forward and disruptive in the way that they operate and/or the value proposition that they offer to consumers. 
•Attractive categories within the consumer products industry broadly. Categories where competitive dynamics remain supportive of growth opportunities, there are pockets of growth or pent-up demand, adjacency opportunities, multiple routes to market or consolidation potential. 
•Well-established strategic moat. Entrenched, defensible leadership positions in core growth categories. 
•Strong margin potential. Attractive gross margin and adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) margin performance with identifiable opportunities for organic growth and operating leverage through increased scale. 
•Strong free cash flow capability. Limited capital expenditure needs and modest working capital requirements to drive strong cash generation. 
•Portfolio optionality. Our goal is to build multiple paths to value creation, either with in-bound or out-bound M&A. We favor businesses with platform opportunities, where the structure of a candidate enables building or disaggregating consumer products businesses over time. 
•Experienced management team. We seek businesses with deep, experienced and talented management teams to lead the business and have responsibility for driving operating results. 
•Desire to become a standalone public company. We seek a business that has a desire to become a standalone public company and retain its economic autonomy. 
These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, we use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our Partnering Transaction with a candidate that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Partnering Transaction may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria deemed relevant by our management in effecting our Partnering Transaction consistent with our business objectives. In the event that we decide to enter into our Partnering Transaction with a candidate that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the candidate does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our Partnering Transaction, which, as 
discussed in this report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). 
While our Series A, Series B and Series C common stock capital structure with its low vote, high vote and no vote, respectively, features differs from the typical capital structure of many other special purpose acquisition companies, we expect to maintain this capital structure following our Partnering Transaction. See “Risks Relating to our Securities — The voting structure of our common stock will have the effect of concentrating voting power with our Sponsor, which will limit a stockholder’s ability to influence our policies and the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control” in Item 1A of Part I of this report. However, maintenance of this capital structure is not a condition for us to evaluate acquisition opportunities and we may, in our sole discretion, seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to eliminate our Series B common stock or its high vote feature in connection with our Partnering Transaction. 
Our Competitive Strengths
The sourcing, valuation, diligence and execution capabilities of our management team and Post provides us with a significant pipeline of opportunities from which to evaluate and select a business that will benefit from our expertise. Our competitive strengths include the following core principles by which we govern ourselves: 
•Long-term orientation. Closing our Partnering Transaction is important, but we are intensely focused on long-term share price performance and the interests of our common stockholders post-closing. 
•Partnership model. We are not reliant on finding a company which needs operational improvement, cost-cutting or replacing senior management. We are not activist investors. We are not buyout specialists. We are not short-term promoters. We have a long-term partnership mentality and collaborative investment model which is grounded and driven by our belief in fairness and alignment of interests. 
•Committed co-investment capital. Post, through our Sponsor, has committed to co-investing alongside public market investors, as evidenced by its purchase of $40,000,000 of Units in our initial public offering, its purchase of $10,900,000 of Private Placement Units in our Private Placement and its agreement to purchase, at our election, up to $100,000,000 of Forward Purchase Units upon consummation of our Partnering Transaction. We believe that our committed capital in conjunction with our aligned economic interests will allow us to enter into a Partnering Transaction with a high quality company.
•Continued ownership. We are focused on partnering with management teams who are focused on long-term compounded growth and existing owners who may want to continue ownership in a high quality asset, but need to provide liquidity to existing stockholders and/or limited partners. PHPC provides an ability to transition ownership to the public market, which is deeper and more liquid than the private market, in a disciplined fashion and for existing owners to share in the future upside potential over the long term. 
•Deep experience of our Sponsor and our management team. We believe that our ability to leverage the operational experience of Post, which has completed over 20 acquisitions since 2012 across a wide spectrum of size, subsector and ownership structures, provides us with a distinct advantage in being able to source, diligence and add value post-closing of the Partnering Transaction. 
•Differentiated sourcing channels with leading industry, private equity and venture capital relationships. Our management team and our Sponsor believe the capabilities and connections associated with our management team provide us with a differentiated pipeline of partnering opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the market to replicate. We believe these sourcing capabilities are further bolstered by our management team’s reputation and deep industry, private equity and venture capital relationships. 
•Investing experience. Our management team and our Sponsor believe that our management’s track record of identifying and sourcing transactions in the consumer sector positions us well to appropriately evaluate potential target candidates and select one that will be well received by the public markets and our stockholders. 
•Post-closing value-add capabilities and requirements. Our management team and our Sponsor believe that our combined expertise and reputation will allow us to drive meaningful value post-closing with the target company. If our value-add is not readily identifiable, then we will choose not to execute that Partnering Transaction. 
We believe our ability to complete a Partnering Transaction is enhanced by our having entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement with our Sponsor pursuant to which our Sponsor committed to purchase from us, at our election, up to 10,000,000 Forward Purchase Units, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our Partnering Transaction. 
Our Process
In evaluating a prospective target candidate, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees and inspection of physical assets, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information made available to us. We also employ third party diligence to support our internal efforts where appropriate. 
We are not prohibited from pursuing a Partnering Transaction with a business that is owned by our Sponsor or by Post, 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc., BellRing Brands, Inc., Lewis & Clark Partners or any of their subsidiaries or any other entities with an executive management team that may from time to time include one or more members of our management team (collectively, “Related Companies”), or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with any of them. In the event we seek to complete our Partnering Transaction with a target that is owned by one of the Related Companies, a committee of our independent and disinterested directors will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another accounting, valuation or appraisal firm that such Partnering Transaction is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. However, we are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
Each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Partnering Transaction if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a candidate business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Partnering Transaction. 
As described under “Conflicts of Interest” in Item 10 of Part III of this report, each of our officers and directors has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities, including, in certain cases, to Post, pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a Partnering Transaction opportunity to such entities before he or she presents such opportunity to us. Also, none of our Sponsor or any of our directors or officers is prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with any other blank check companies, including in connection with their own partnering transactions. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Partnering Transaction opportunity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to another entity, including, in certain cases, to Post, he or she may only present such opportunity to us if such other entity, including, in certain cases, Post, rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company, such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue and such person has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to present the opportunity to any other person or entity, including, in certain cases, to Post. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our Partnering Transaction. We believe that potential conflicts with Post are naturally mitigated by the differing nature of the investments Post would typically consider most synergistic to the existing Post businesses and the types of transactions we expect to find most attractive based, in part, on transaction size and ability to operate as a standalone public company. Notwithstanding our belief regarding natural mitigation, Post and its subsidiaries may compete with us for acquisition opportunities that fall within Post’s investment objectives or strategies. A decision by Post to pursue an opportunity would preclude us from pursuing it and could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our Partnering Transaction. 
You should not rely on the historical record or performance of Post or our management team as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward. See “Risks Relating to Our Search for, and Consummation of or Inability to Consummate, a Partnering Transaction — Past performance by Post and members of our management team may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Partnering Transaction 
The NYSE listing rules require that our Partnering Transaction must be with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing of a definitive agreement in connection with our Partnering Transaction. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Partnering Transaction, although there is no assurance that will be the case. 
We anticipate structuring our Partnering Transaction so that the post-transaction company (in which holders of our Public Shares (“Public Stockholders”) own or acquire shares) will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Partnering Transaction such that the post-transaction 
company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Partnering Transaction if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target, our stockholders prior to our Partnering Transaction may collectively own a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-Partnering Transaction company, depending on, among other things, valuations ascribed to the target and us in our Partnering Transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target business, issue a substantial number of new shares to third parties in connection with financing our Partnering Transaction or our Sponsor could convert some or all of its Series B common stock into Series A common stock. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock or other changes to our capital structure, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction (including our Sponsor) could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction and therefore a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-transaction company. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our Partnering Transaction involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test. 
Sourcing of Potential Partnering Transaction Targets 
We believe our management team’s significant transaction experience and industry relationships with companies will continue to provide us with a substantial number of potential Partnering Transaction targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 
We believe this network provides our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities that are proprietary or that have a limited group of investors that are invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team have and will continue to provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. 
We are not prohibited from pursuing a Partnering Transaction with a business that is owned by our Sponsor or any of the Related Companies, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with any of them. In the event that we seek to complete our Partnering Transaction with a target that is owned by any of the Related Companies or our Sponsor, our officers, directors, we or a committee of our independent and disinterested directors will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another accounting, valuation or appraisal firm that such Partnering Transaction is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. However, we are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
See “Conflicts of Interest” in Item 10 of Part III of this report for information regarding limitations on our access to investment opportunities sourced by members of our management team, Post and other entities in which members of our management team are involved, including a list of our executive officers and directors and entities for which a conflict of interest may or does exist between such officers and our Company. 
Status as a Public Company 
We believe our structure makes us an attractive Partnering Transaction counterparty to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer target businesses an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar partnering transaction. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a Partnering Transaction with us. 
Furthermore, once a proposed Partnering Transaction is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
Financial Position 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $345,000,000 in the Trust Account that we may use to complete our Partnering Transaction, excluding payment of $10,675,000 of deferred underwriting commissions payable upon consummation of our Partnering Transaction. With the funds available in the Trust Account and up to $100,000,000 that may be received pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement, we offer a target business a variety of options, such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our Partnering Transaction using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting our Partnering Transaction 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our Partnering Transaction using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units and Forward Purchase Units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our Partnering Transaction. We may seek to complete our Partnering Transaction with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
If our Partnering Transaction is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Partnering Transaction or used for redemption of our Public Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Partnering Transaction, to fund the purchase of other businesses or for working capital. 
In addition to the Forward Purchase Agreement, we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Partnering Transaction, and we may effectuate our Partnering Transaction using the proceeds of such offerings or loans rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. 
In the case of a Partnering Transaction funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the Partnering Transaction would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our Partnering Transaction. Other than the Forward Purchase Agreement, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Partnering Transaction 
The NYSE’s listing rules require that our Partnering Transaction must be with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing of a definitive agreement in connection with our Partnering Transaction. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not 
currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Partnering Transaction, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Subject to this requirement, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we are not permitted to effectuate our Partnering Transaction solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
In any case, we will only complete a Partnering Transaction if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for our stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our Partnering Transaction. 
To the extent we effect our Partnering Transaction with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information made available to us. 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Partnering Transaction, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Partnering Transaction is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Partnering Transaction. 
Lack of Business Diversification 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Partnering Transaction, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. 
By completing our Partnering Transaction with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several partnering transactions in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be: 
•solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or 
•dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our Partnering Transaction. 
Potential Management Concerns Post-Partnering Transaction 
Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Partnering Transaction with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate’s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our Partnering Transaction, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place and it is highly unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Partnering Transaction. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
Some or all of our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the post-Partnering Transaction company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Partnering Transaction. 
Following our Partnering Transaction, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or additional managers may not have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management team. 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Partnering Transaction 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of Partnering Transactions we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the Company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the Company | No 
Merger of the Company with a target | Yes 

Under the NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our Partnering Transaction if, for example: 
•we issue (other than in a public offering for cash) shares of common stock that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding; 
•any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of shares of common stock could result in an issuance that exceeds either 5% of the number of shares of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before issuance; or 
•the issuance or potential issuance will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Partnering Transaction in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and other reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
•the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the Company; 
•the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote; 
•the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed Partnering Transaction; 
•other time and budget constraints of the Company; and 
•additional legal complexities of a proposed Partnering Transaction that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders. 
Permitted Purchases and other Transactions with respect to our Securities 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our Partnering Transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Partnering Transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers or advisors or any of the Related Companies and their directors, officers or advisors may purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Partnering Transaction. There is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our Partnering Transaction, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our Sponsor, directors, officers or advisors or any of the Related Companies or their directors, officers or advisors may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire Public Shares, vote their Public Shares in favor of our Partnering Transaction or not redeem their Public Shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such purchases or other transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such purchases or other transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any 
material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. 
In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers or advisors or any of the Related Companies or their directors, officers or advisors purchase Public Shares in privately negotiated transactions from Public Stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our Partnering Transaction, such selling Public Stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their Public Shares and any proxy to vote against our Partnering Transaction. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. 
The purpose of any such transaction could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the Partnering Transaction and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Partnering Transaction, (2) reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding or to vote such Public Warrants on any matters submitted to the Public Warrant holders for approval in connection with our Partnering Transaction or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the consummation of our Partnering Transaction, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions may result in the completion of our Partnering Transaction that may not otherwise have been possible. 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Series A common stock or Warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
Our Sponsor, officers, directors and advisors anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or advisors or any of the Related Companies or their officers, directors or advisors may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of Public Shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our Partnering Transaction. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors or advisors or any of the Related Companies or their officers, directors or advisors enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our Partnering Transaction. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a Public Stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its Public Shares in connection with our Partnering Transaction. Our Sponsor, officers, directors or advisors or any of the Related Companies or their officers, directors or advisors will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and all other federal securities laws. 
Any purchases by any person who is an affiliated purchaser under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act will be restricted unless such purchases are made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers and directors and any of the Related Companies and their officers and directors will be restricted from making purchases of common stock if such purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Partnering Transaction 
We will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Partnering Transaction at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Partnering Transaction, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to certain limitations. At completion of the Partnering Transaction, we will be required to purchase any Public Shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our Partnering Transaction with respect to our Warrants. The per-share amount we will distribute to Public Stockholders who properly redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by 
the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors entered into a letter agreement with us on May 25, 2021 (the “Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of Series A common stock and Founder Shares (including any shares of our Series B common stock or Series A common stock issued upon conversion therefrom) held by them in connection with the completion of our Partnering Transaction. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
We will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Partnering Transaction either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Partnering Transaction; or (2) by means of a tender offer. At completion of the Partnering Transaction, we will be required to purchase any Public Shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. Except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Partnering Transaction or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a Partnering Transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed Partnering Transaction. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
•conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 
•file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Partnering Transaction which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Partnering Transaction and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
Upon the public announcement of our Partnering Transaction, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Series A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our Public Shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Partnering Transaction until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on Public Stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Partnering Transaction. If Public Stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such Partnering Transaction, and we instead may search for an alternate Partnering Transaction (including, potentially, with the same target). 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
•conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
•file proxy materials with the SEC. 
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to Public Stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration. 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our Partnering Transaction, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon the consummation of the Partnering Transaction. 
If we seek stockholder approval of our Partnering Transaction, we will complete our Partnering Transaction only if a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted are voted in favor of the Partnering Transaction, subject to any other vote required by applicable law. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of our outstanding capital stock representing a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, have agreed to vote any shares of Series A common stock and Founder Shares (including any shares of our Series B common stock or Series A common stock issued upon conversion therefrom) held by them in favor of our Partnering Transaction. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our Partnering Transaction, our Sponsor and its permitted transferees will own approximately 31% of our outstanding shares of common stock (including the Private Placement Shares underlying the Private Placement Units and the Public Shares underlying the Affiliated Units) entitled to vote thereon. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements may make it more likely that we will consummate our Partnering Transaction. Each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares without voting and, if it does vote, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor, executive officers and directors entered into the Letter Agreement, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of Series A common stock and Founder Shares (including any shares of our Series B common stock or Series A common stock issued upon conversion therefrom) held by them in connection with the completion of a Partnering Transaction. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. Redemptions of our Public Shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our Partnering Transaction. For example, the proposed Partnering Transaction may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed Partnering Transaction. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all of the Public Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Partnering Transaction exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Partnering Transaction or redeem any shares, and all Public Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate Partnering Transaction (including, potentially, with the same target). 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Partnering Transaction if we Seek Stockholder Approval 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our Partnering Transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Partnering Transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its Public Shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of Public Shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Partnering Transaction as a means to force us or our Sponsor to purchase their Public Shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a Public Stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares sold in our IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s Public Shares are not purchased by us or our Sponsor at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the Public Shares sold in our IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Partnering Transaction, particularly in connection with a Partnering Transaction with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Partnering Transaction. 
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
We may require our Public Stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their Public Shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the Partnering Transaction in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their Public Shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the Partnering Transaction at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as 
applicable, that we will furnish to our Public Stockholders in connection with our Partnering Transaction will indicate whether we are requiring Public Stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its Public Shares. Accordingly, a Public Stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the Partnering Transaction if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its Public Shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to Public Stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares. 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by some blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their partnering transactions, some blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on a partnering transaction, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed partnering transaction and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the partnering transaction was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the partnering transaction during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the partnering transaction until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the Partnering Transaction is approved. 
Any request to redeem such Public Shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the scheduled date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a Public Stockholder delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to Public Stockholders electing to redeem their Public Shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our Partnering Transaction. 
If our Partnering Transaction is not approved or completed for any reason, then our Public Stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by Public Stockholders who elected to redeem their Public Shares. 
If our proposed Partnering Transaction is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a Partnering Transaction until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering (or 27 months from the closing of our initial public offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for a Partnering Transaction within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering (such 24-month or 27-month period, the “Combination Period”)) or during any extended time that we have to consummate a Partnering Transaction beyond the Combination Period as a result of a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (an “Extension Period”). 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Partnering Transaction 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have only the Combination Period to complete our Partnering Transaction. If we have not completed our Partnering Transaction within such Combination Period or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval 
of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Partnering Transaction within the Combination Period. 
Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors have entered into the Letter Agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares (including any shares of our Series B common stock or Series A common stock issued upon conversion therefrom) held by them if we fail to complete our Partnering Transaction within the Combination Period or during any Extension Period (although our Sponsor, officers and directors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if we fail to complete our Partnering Transaction within the prescribed time frame). 
Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our Partnering Transaction or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our Partnering Transaction within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Partnering Transaction activity, unless we provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares. However, we may not redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $2,444,148 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account (as of December 31, 2021), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our Public Stockholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be substantially less than $10.00. See “Risks Relating to Our Search for, and Consummation of or Inability to Consummate, a Partnering Transaction — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by our Public Stockholders may be less than $10.00 per Public Share” in Item 1A of Part I of this report and other risk factors described below. Under Section 281(b) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we may not have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 
Although we will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our Public Stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management team will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. 
Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable 
to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per Public Share; and (2) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our Company and, therefore, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our Partnering Transaction and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per Public Share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our Partnering Transaction, and our Public Stockholders would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of their Public Shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We believe the likelihood of our Sponsor having to indemnify the Trust Account is limited because we will continue to endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per Public Share and (2) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be substantially less than $10.00 per Public Share. See “Risks Relating to Our Search for, and Consummation of or Inability to Consummate, a Partnering Transaction — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by our Public Stockholders may be less than $10.00 per Public Share” in Item 1A of Part I of this report and other risk factors described below. 
We will continue to seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by continuing to endeavor to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $2,400,000 from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with any liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our Partnering Transaction within the required time period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our Partnering Transaction within the required time period is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to 
Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we have not completed our Partnering Transaction within the Combination Period or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of our acquisition period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time, that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will continue to be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per Public Share and (2) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we may not be able to return $10.00 per Public Share to our Public Stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying Public Stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons. See “If, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our Public Stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
A Public Stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our Partnering Transaction and then, only in connection with those Public Shares that such stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to certain limitations; (2) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our Partnering Transaction or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our Partnering Transaction within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Partnering Transaction activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our Public Shares if we have not completed our Partnering Transaction within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a Public Stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we 
seek stockholder approval in connection with our Partnering Transaction, a stockholder’s vote in connection with our Partnering Transaction alone will not result in such stockholder redeeming its shares for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. Holders of Warrants will not have any rights to proceeds held in the Trust Account with respect to the Warrants. 
Competition 
We expect to continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Furthermore, our high vote capital structure differs from the typical capital structure of many other special purpose acquisition company competitors and may make us less attractive to an acquisition target or may make an acquisition more costly to complete. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units and Forward Purchase Units, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Partnering Transaction and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing a Partnering Transaction. 
Facilities 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 2503 S. Hanley Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63144. The cost for this space is included in the $40,000 per month fee that we pay Post and certain of its subsidiaries for office space and administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
We currently have two officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our Partnering Transaction. Such officers are both employees of Post and receive their compensation directly from Post. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Partnering Transaction. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our Company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Partnering Transaction and the current stage of the Partnering Transaction process. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
We registered our Units, Public Shares and Public Warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this report contains, and our future annual reports will contain, financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm. 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our Partnering Transaction within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential Partnering Transaction candidates, we do not believe that this limitation is material. 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. 
The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
Prior to the date of this report, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our Partnering Transaction. 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are taking advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
