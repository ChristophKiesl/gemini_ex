Executive Overview
 
In July 2017, our Board of Directors entered into a licensing agreement with The Starco Group, located in Los Angeles, California, to pursue a new strategic marketing plan involving commercializing leading edge products with the intent to sell them through brick and mortar retailers as well as through online retailers. Management believes the Company will realize modest earnings from royalties in the short term with a stronger positive outlook over the next 24 months as the Company begins to implement stronger pull through marketing efforts. 
 
Starco Brands, Inc. is a company whose mission is to create behavior-changing products and brands. Our core competency is inventing brands, marketing, building trends, pushing awareness and social marketing. The licensing agreement with The Starco Group provided Starco Brands with certain products on exclusive and royalty-free basis and other products on a non-exclusive and royalty basis; in the following categories: food, household cleaning, air care, spirits and personal care. The Starco Group is predominantly an aerosol and liquid fill private label and branded manufacturer with manufacturing assets in the following verticals: DIY/Hardware, paints, coatings and adhesives, household, air care, disinfectants, automotive, motorcycle, arts & crafts, personal care cosmetics, personal care FDA, sun care, food, cooking oils, beverage, spirits and wine.
 
The current CEO and owner of The Starco Group, Ross Sklar, was named the CEO of Starco Brands in August of 2017. Mr. Sklar has a long track record of commercializing technology in industrial and consumer markets. Mr. Sklar has built teams of manufacturing personnel, R&D and sales and marketing professionals over the last 20 years and has grown The Starco Group into a successful and diversified manufacturer supplying a wide range of products to some of the largest retailers in the United States.
 
The Company has conducted extensive research and has identified specific channels to penetrate with its new portfolio of novel technologies. The Company intends to raise capital to assist in launching and marketing these products through debt and equity financing. The Company has begun to execute this vision and has launched the first product line called ‘Breathe ™’, through our manufacturing partner, The Starco Group (“TSG”). Breathe is an environmentally-friendly line of household cleaning aerosol products. It is the world’s first aerosol household cleaning line to be approved by the EPA’s Safer Choice program. This product line is biodegradable and is propelled by nitrogen, which makes up approximately 80% of the earths breathable air. Breathe was named Partner of the Year by the EPAs Safer Choice Program for 2018, a tremendous honor.

The Breathe line is predominantly on 300 to 400 stores serviced through UNFI as well as in almost 500 Home Depots through a distributor called Central Garden Excel (Central), one of the largest distributors to the DIY/Hardware retail channel. Central will be handling all of the Companys distribution to Home Depot. The Breathe Hand Sanitizer Spray was recently name the exclusive hand sanitizer spray at all Home Depots and the 1oz is now at every check out as well.The Breathe line is available on Amazon and Walmart.com and also available at Lowes. 
 
The Company is also the marketer of record for Betterbilts Kleen Out branded drain opener and for the Winona Popcorn Spray. The Company provides marketing services to these brands when needed as per the terms of the agreement. Both products are available in all Walmart stores. Through the Companys relationship with TSG and their marketing partner Deutsch Marketing, the Company launched a new label in June 2019 for Winona Popcorn Spray throughout all Walmart stores. The Company also launched the Winona Popcorn Spray on Amazon through our strategic partner Patter (formally iServe), who is a shareholder in Starco Brands, Inc. The Company expects sales to continue to grow in this space.
 
In addition, as long as the Company can continue to raise capital the Company plans to launch other products in hair care, food, personal care, spirits and beverages over the next 60 months. Although the initial market reception to our new lines has been encouraging, the Company may encounter a number of hurdles that could prevent this and future product launches from achieving sustained commercial success. Financing growth and launching of new products is key as the Companys ability to raise further capital is critical. 
 
We will need to rely on sales of our common stock in order to raise additional capital. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.  The Company is planning to utilize, as best as possible with limited financing, the services of Deutsch Marketing in order to help support the Companys plan. The Company will also utilize the marketing capabilities of Hearst Media with its co branding arrangement on some of its products.This is significantly assisting in supporting its current retail and online distribution. The Company is also planning on launching new products over the next year that are viewed as disruptive in their market and leading edge, again as long as their financing plans come to fruition. The Company has now engaged with and contracted with, a financial advisory firm to assist the Company in procuring future financing.
 
The Companys ultimate goal is to become a leading brand owner and third-party marketer of cutting edge technologies in the consumer marketplace whose success is expected to increase shareholder value. The Company will continue to evaluate this and other opportunities to further set its strategy for 2021 and beyond.
