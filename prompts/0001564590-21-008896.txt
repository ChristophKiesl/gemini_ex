ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 TimkenSteel Corporation (we, us, our, the Company or TimkenSteel) was incorporated in Ohio on October 24, 2013, and became an independent, publicly traded company as the result of a spinoff from The Timken Company (Timken) on June 30, 2014. In the spinoff, Timken transferred to us all of the assets and generally all of the liabilities related to Timken’s steel business.
 We manufacture alloy steel, as well as carbon and micro-alloy steel, with an annual melt capacity of approximately 2 million tons and shipment capacity of 1.5 million tons. Our portfolio includes special bar quality (SBQ) bars, seamless mechanical tubing (tubes), value-added solutions such as precision steel components, and billets. In addition, we supply machining and thermal treatment services, and we manage raw material recycling programs, which are also used as a feeder system for our melt operations. Our products and services are used in a diverse range of demanding applications in the following market sectors: automotive; oil and gas; industrial equipment; mining; construction; rail; defense; heavy truck; agriculture; power generation; and oil country tubular goods (OCTG).
 SBQ steel is made to restrictive chemical compositions and high internal purity levels and is used in critical mechanical applications. We make these products from nearly 100% recycled steel, using our expertise in raw materials to create custom steel products. We focus on creating tailored products and services for our customers’ most demanding applications. Our engineers are experts in both materials and applications, so we can work closely with each customer to deliver flexible solutions related to our products as well as to their applications and supply chains.
 The SBQ bar, tube, and billet production processes take place at our Canton, Ohio manufacturing location. This location accounts for all of the SBQ bars, seamless mechanical tubes and billets we produce and includes three manufacturing facilities: the Faircrest, Harrison and Gambrinus facilities. Our value-added solutions production processes take place at two downstream manufacturing facilities: Tryon Peak (Columbus, North Carolina) and St. Clair (Eaton, Ohio). Many of the production processes are integrated, and the manufacturing facilities produce products that are sold in all of our market sectors. As a result, investments in our facilities and resource allocation decisions affecting our operations are designed to benefit the overall business, not any specific aspect of the business.
 During the first quarter of 2020, management completed its previously announced plan to close the Company’s TimkenSteel Material Services facility in Houston, Texas. See “Note 6 - Disposition of Non-Core Assets” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the closure of this facility.
 
On February 16, 2021, management announced a plan to indefinitely idle our Harrison melt and cast assets, late in the first quarter of 2021. Going forward, all of the Company’s melting and casting activities will take place at the Faircrest location. We are working collaboratively with employees, suppliers and a number of customers to ensure a well-organized and efficient transition. Our rolling and finishing operations at Harrison will not be impacted by these actions. See “Note 20 – Subsequent Events” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 Operating Segments
 We conduct our business activities and report financial results as one business segment. The presentation of financial results as one reportable segment is consistent with the way we operate our business and is consistent with the manner in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates performance and makes resource and operating decisions for the business as described above. Furthermore, the Company notes that monitoring financial results as one reportable segment helps the CODM manage costs on a consolidated basis, consistent with the integrated nature of our operations.

Major Customers
 We sell products and services that are used in a range of demanding applications around the world. We have over 400 diverse customers in the following market sectors: automotive; oil and gas; industrial equipment; mining; construction; rail; defense; heavy truck; agriculture; power generation; and OCTG.
Products
 We believe we produce some of the cleanest, highest performing alloy air-melted steels in the world for our customers’ most demanding applications. We leverage our technical knowledge, development expertise and production and engineering capabilities across all of our products and end-markets to deliver high-performance products to our customers.
 SBQ Steel Bar, Seamless Mechanical Steel Tubes, and Billets. Our focus is on alloy steel, although in total we manufacture more than 400 grades of high-performance carbon, micro-alloy and alloy steel, sold as ingots, bars, tubes and billets. These products are custom-made in a variety of chemistries, lengths and finishes. Our metallurgical expertise and what we believe to be unique operational capabilities drive high-value solutions for industrial, energy and mobile customers. Our specialty steels are featured in a wide variety of end products including: gears; hubs; axles; crankshafts and connecting rods; oil country drill pipe; bits and collars; bearing races and rolling elements; bushings; fuel injectors; wind energy shafts; anti-friction bearings; and other demanding applications where mechanical power transmission is critical to the end customer.
 Value-added Precision Products and Services. In addition to our customized steels, we also custom-make precision components that provide us with the opportunity to further expand our market for bar and tube products and capture additional sales. These products provide customers, especially those in the automotive industry, with ready-to-finish components that simplify vendor management, streamline supply chains and often cost less than other alternatives. We also customize products and services for the industrial and energy market sectors.
Sales and Distribution
 Our sales force is made up largely of engineers that are backed by a team of metallurgists and other technical experts. While most of our products are sold directly to original equipment (OE) manufacturers, a portion of our sales are made through authorized distributors and steel service centers, representing approximately 17% of net sales during 2020. The majority of our customers are served through individually negotiated price agreements.
Competition
 The steel industry, both domestically and globally, is highly competitive and is expected to remain so. Maintaining high standards of product quality and reliability, while keeping production costs competitive, is essential to our ability to compete with domestic and foreign manufacturers of alloy steel and mechanical components. For bar products less than 6-inch in diameter, principal competitors include foreign-owned domestic producers Gerdau Special Steel North America (a unit of Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau, S.A) and Republic Steel (a unit of Mexican steel producer ICH). For bar products up to 9-inch in diameter, domestic producers Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Nucor Corporation (in some cases up to 10-inch) are our principal competitors. For very large bars from 10 to 16 inches in diameter, offshore producers as well as specialty forging companies in North America such as Scot Forge are the primary competitors. For seamless mechanical tubing, offshore producers such as Tenaris, S.A., Vallourec, S.A. and TMK Group are our primary competitors as well as the foreign-owned domestic producer ArcelorMittal Tubular Products (a unit of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, S.A.). We also provide unique value-added steel products and supply chain solutions to our customers in the mobile, industrial and energy sectors. Competitors within the value-added market sector include both integrated and non-integrated component producers.
Lead Time
 The lead time for our products varies based on the product type and specifications. As of the date of this filing, lead times for SBQ bars are averaging approximately 9 to 10 weeks and lead times for tubes are averaging approximately 13 weeks.
Raw Materials
 The principal raw materials that we use to manufacture steel are recycled scrap metal, chrome, nickel, molybdenum oxide, vanadium and other alloy materials. Raw materials comprise a significant portion of the steelmaking cost structure and are subject to price and availability changes due to global demand fluctuations and local supply limitations. Proper selection and management of raw materials can have a significant impact on procurement cost, flexibility to supply changes, steelmaking energy costs and mill productivity. In addition to accessing scrap and alloys through the open market, we have established a scrap return supply chain with many of our customers. This part of our business leverages our knowledge of the raw material supply industry and an extensive network of relationships that result in steady, reliable supply from our raw 
 4


material sources. We previously operated a scrap processing facility as an additional source of raw materials; however, during the fourth quarter of 2019 we marketed and subsequently entered into an agreement to dispose of the assets associated with the operation. The disposal was completed in January 2020. See “Note 6 - Disposition of Non-Core Assets” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 Research and Development
 Our engineers analyze customer application challenges and develop solutions to address the customers’ needs. With a century of experience in materials science and steelmaking, we leverage our technical know-how to improve the performance of our customers’ products and supply chains.
 This expertise extends to advanced process technology in which material conversion, finishing, gaging and assembly enables high quality production of our products. With resources dedicated to studying, developing and implementing new manufacturing processes and technologies, we are able to support our customers’ requirements.
 Our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $1.8 million, $4.1 million and $8.1 million, respectively.
 Environmental Matters and Governmental Regulations
 We consider compliance with environmental regulations and environmental sustainability a key strategic focus area and integral to our responsibility as a good corporate citizen. All our domestic steel making and processing operations, and our water treatment plant, have obtained and maintain ISO 14001 certification.
 We believe we have established appropriate reserves to cover our environmental expenses. We have a well-established environmental compliance audit program that measures performance against applicable laws as well as against internal standards that have been established for all facilities. It is difficult to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements that differ from existing ones both domestically and internationally. As previously reported, we are unsure of the future financial impact to us from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rule changes related to the Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), waste and other environmental rules and regulations.
 We and certain of our subsidiaries located in the U.S. have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), CAA and CWA, as well as other laws. In general, certain cost allocations for investigation and remediation have been asserted by us against other entities, which are believed to be financially solvent and are expected to substantially fulfill their proportionate share of any obligations.
 From time to time, we may be a party to lawsuits, claims or other proceedings related to environmental matters and/or receive notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the EPA and similar state or local authorities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded reserves for such environmental matters of $0.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Accruals related to such environmental matters represent management’s best estimate of the fees and costs associated with these matters. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such matters, management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 Legal Proceedings
 Information required by this section is incorporated herein by reference to “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”.
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 While we own a number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, licenses and copyrights, none are material to our products and production processes.
 Human Capital
 Employment
 At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,000 employees, with about 62% of our employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement that expires in September 2021.
 Health and safety
 At TimkenSteel, operating safely and responsibly is our top priority. We have rigorous safety policies and practices in place to ensure that our workspaces provide a secure environment for our employees. We help ensure these policies are followed through education, training, evaluation and enforcement. To help emphasize that safety is of the upmost importance, a safety modifier is included in our annual incentive compensation plan for salaried employees. The safety modifier has the effect of increasing the overall incentive payout by five percent if the target safety 
 5


metrics are achieved and decreasing the overall incentive payout by five percent if the target safety metric are not achieved. As of December 31, 2020, our OSHA recordable incident rate was 1.70 and our lost time incident rate was 0.34. Both rates came in below their respective targets for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 Diversity and inclusion
 Our commitment to diverse perspectives fuels our success and has enabled us to deliver innovate solutions throughout the life our business. We recognize that a diverse workforce and inclusive, engaging culture is key to our continued business success. Within our organization, we maintain employee resource groups which further promote diversity and inclusion. TimkenSteel is also proudly involved in several organizations that promote and foster diversity and inclusion in our community and industry.
 Compensation and total rewards
 We provide competitive compensation programs to help meet the needs of our employees. Our programs are designed to support the profitable growth of our business; attract, reward, and retain the talent we need to succeed; support the health and overall well-being of our employees; and reinforce a performance-based culture. 
 In addition to base compensation, we offer quarterly and annual incentive compensation, stock awards, and participation in various retirement plans. Furthermore, our Company also provides employer-sponsored health and wellness benefits to our employees.
 Employee retention
 We seek to retain the best people by providing them with opportunities to grow, build skills and be appreciated for their contributions as they work to serve our customers. Our employees are critical to our success and are the reason we continue to execute at a high level. We believe our continued focus on making employee engagement a top priority will help us provide high quality products to our customers.
 We diligently track our employee retention and management continuously evaluates our employees’ retention risk. Additionally, our Company has an established voluntary turnover metric, which was not exceeded during the year ended December 31, 2020.
 Employee training and development
 We invest significant resources to develop talent with the right capabilities to deliver the growth and innovation needed to support our business strategy. We have designed curated training programs for employees at all levels in our SAP SuccessFactors learning software. For new managers, we have developed a rigorous training program to provide them with the resources needed to cultivate their skillset and aid them in becoming effective leaders in our business. TimkenSteel encourages our employees to constantly learn and grow and has aligned our performance management system to support this focus on continuous learning and development.
 COVID-19 pandemic
 At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, TimkenSteel was considered an "essential business" and therefore, the Company has been fully operational and serving its customers while strictly following all public health directives to ensure the safety of its employees. 
 Our cross-functional pandemic response team meets weekly to oversee and coordinate the Company’s overall response. The Company is committed to frequent communications with our employees and their families as well as customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders of TimkenSteel.
 We have taken several necessary actions to keep our workforce safe. Employees who can work from home are doing so, and employees onsite are strictly following safe workplace practices including guidelines established by federal, state and local authorities for the areas in which we operate. We have added enhanced cleaning procedures in all plants and offices using the best practices provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is strongly encouraged that employees be vigilant with their personal hygiene and workplace hygiene and we regularly communicate the requirement for wearing of masks and that no one should come to work sick. To help reinforce these safety measures, we work closely with the United Steelworkers (USW). The Company also utilizes its onsite medical clinic - operated by a local health system - to provide additional support to its employees during the crisis. Since March 2020, TimkenSteel has performed hundreds of audits in its plants to ensure its employees remain diligent in these efforts.
 As a result of the pandemic, the Company has implemented demand-driven layoffs, unpaid furloughs and temporary compensation reductions to both its employees and board of directors for a portion of 2020. In order to mitigate some of these actions, the Company extended health insurance to furloughed employees for a certain period. Further, the Company offered paid sick leave for certain periods and encouraged the use of our existing employee assistance programs to address wellness and mental health concerns.
