Business Strategy, Industry Trends, Products and Services
 Business Strategy
 Our objective is to create a technology-enabled engineering, software and training services platform by capitalizing on near and long-term growth opportunities primarily in the nuclear industry.  We offer our differentiated suite of products and services to adjacent markets such as fossil power and the process industries where our offerings are a natural fit with a clear and compelling value proposition for the market.  Our primary growth strategy is twofold: (1) expand organically within our core markets by leveraging our market leadership position and drive increased usage and product adoption via new products and services, and (2) seek acquisitions to accelerate our overall growth in a manner that is complementary to our core business.  To accomplish this, we will pursue the following activities:
 Expand our total addressable market.  Our focus on growth means introducing product capabilities or new product categories that create value for our customers and therefore expand our total addressable market.  Currently we are working on initiatives to expand our solution offerings in both our business segments which may include, but not be limited to, the following: expanding our software product portfolio to the industries we serve with enhanced power and process simulation tools and systems that are complementary to our core offerings; delivering enhanced learning management systems/solutions; offering fully outsourced training solutions to our customers; adding work flow process improvement solutions; and tailoring operational reporting and business intelligence solutions to address the unique need of our end user markets. 
 Initiatives such as these will broaden our scope and enable us to engage more deeply with the segments we serve.  Recently, we have delivered a compelling new solution, the GSE GPWRTM Generic Pressurized Water Reactor simulation technology, proving that our modeling technology can be sold via traditional license terms and conditions to the nuclear industry ecosystem.  We have both upgraded and expanded the EnVision library of simulation and eLearning tutorials for the process industries with specific new products for training clients in the upstream segment of the oil and gas industry.  We continue to provide cutting edge training systems by adapting our technology to systems to meet the specific needs of customers such as U.S. government laboratories.
 Pursue strategic acquisitions opportunistically.  We intend to complement our organic growth strategy through selective acquisitions of other software, technical engineering, and nuclear oriented training, staffing and consulting service businesses, both domestic and international. We are focusing our efforts on acquisitions that would enhance our existing portfolio of products and services, strengthen our relationships with our existing customers, and potentially expand our footprint to include new customers in our core served industries.  We have made several acquisitions since 2010 and believe the opportunity exists to acquire businesses that are complementary to ours, allowing us to accelerate our growth strategy. 
 In January 2011, we acquired a software company called EnVision Systems Inc., which provided interactive multi-media tutorials and simulation models, primarily to the process industries.  We have integrated the technology assets from this acquisition and expanded the firm's application to other industries, and we intend to repeat this successful process.  In 2014, we acquired Hyperspring, which enabled GSE to offer highly skilled nuclear operations and consulting know-how on site at a large segment of our client base on an operational basis providing essential services.  This deepened our relationship with existing clients and won business for us at new client sites in the nuclear industry.  This acquisition has proven to be synergistic, enabling cross selling domestically, and in 2015, expanding these services internationally for the first time.

Research and development (R&D).  We invest in R&D in order to deliver unique solutions that add value to our end-user markets.  We have delivered nuclear core and Balance-of-Plant modeling and visualization systems to the industry.  To address the nuclear industry's need for more accurate simulation of both normal and accident scenarios, we provide our DesignEP® and RELAP5-HD® solutions.  Our entire JADETM suite of simulation software, including industry leading JTOPMERET® and JElectricTM software, provides the most accurate simulation of Balance-of-Plant and electrical systems available to the nuclear and fossil plant simulation market. The significant enhancements we have made to our SimExec® and OpenSimTM platforms enables customers to be more efficient in the daily operation of their simulators.  We are bringing SimExec® and OpenSimTM together into a next generation unified environment that will add new capabilities as requested by clients and driven by market need. 
 We intend to continue to make prudent investments in R&D that first and foremost are driven by the market, and are complementary to advancing our growth strategy.  Such investments in R&D may result in on-going enhancement of existing solutions as well as the creation of new solutions to serve our target markets, ensuring that we add greater value, in an easier to use fashion, than any alternative available to customers.  GSE has pioneered a number of industry standards over our lifetime and will continue to be one of the most innovative companies in our industry.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have made R&D investments totaling $1.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
 Strengthen and develop our talent.  Our experienced employees and management team are our most valuable resources.  Attracting, training, and retaining top talent is critical to our success.  To achieve our talent goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our employees with entrepreneurial opportunities to increase client contact within their areas of expertise and to expand our business within our service offerings.  We will also continue to provide our employees with training, personal and professional growth opportunities, performance-based incentives including opportunities for stock ownership, bonuses and competitive benefits as benchmarked to our industry and location(s).
 Continue to deliver industry-recognized high quality services.  We have developed a strong reputation for quality services based upon our industry-recognized depth of experience, ability to attract and retain quality professionals, and expertise across multiple service sectors.  We have received many industry certificates and awards including being recognized for outstanding work on projects by Bechtel's Nuclear, Security & Environmental global business unit (NS&E) at the Bechtel Supply Chain Recognition awards in April 2016.  In addition, we have a recognized high-value brand as one of the most respected providers of software and services to the industry, as evidenced by our marquee client base and significant market wins over the past year.  A recently conducted survey of clients with projects underway and/or just delivered validates our brand with a Net Promoter Score of +65, a compelling score for an industrial technology and services company.
 Expand international operations in selected markets.  We believe there are additional opportunities for us to market our software and services to international customers, and to do so in a cost effective manner.  For example, we believe partnerships with Value Added Resellers (VAR) could significantly expand our sales pipeline for the EnVision software suite.  In 2016, we entered into a reseller agreement with an entity in the Middle East that has an established track record of success selling simulation and workforce development solutions to the process industries throughout the region.  Such VARs may yield positive results for our pursuit of international nuclear opportunities globally (see industry trends below).  We may explore the creation of appropriate joint ventures to target nuclear new-build programs in key growth regions.

Industry Trends
 Industry need for building and sustaining a highly skilled workforce
 We believe a critical ongoing challenge facing the industries we serve is access to, and continued development of, a highly trained and efficient workforce.  This challenge manifests primarily in two ways: the increasing pace of the knowledge and experience lost as a significant percentage of the existing experienced workforce reaches retirement age over the next several years; and the fact that as new power plants come on-line, there is an increased demand for more workers to staff and operate those plants in addition to the plants in the existing fleet.
 According to Power Engineering magazine (December 2014), in the United States every sector in the energy industry is expected to lose a large percentage of its workforce within the next few years as baby boomers retire on the traditional schedule.  The power sector alone will be forced to replace more than 100,000 skilled workers by 2018 simply to replace those retiring.  The Nuclear Energy Institute estimates that 39% of the nuclear workforce will be eligible to retire by 2018.  As the nuclear industry expands its fleet and strains to maintain the high standards of training the existing workforce, existing plant simulator systems, which provide these training services, are operating 24 hours a day.  With workers retiring and the need to backfill as well as expand the workforce for new units, certain operators are exploring the opportunity to de-bottleneck their existing simulator capabilities through the creation of dual reference simulators.
 Globally, as more people increase their standard of living, their demand for power will increase, which in turn will require the on-going construction of power plants to meet this surging demand.  Developing a skilled labor force to operate these plants and keeping their skills current and their certifications in compliance with regulatory requirements is a key challenge facing the global power industry.  Similar challenges face the process industries.
 Growing Global Power Demand and the Increasing Emphasis on Nuclear Power
 World Energy Outlook 2015 projects that electricity demand will increase by more than 70% over the time period from 2013 to 2040.  At the same time, countries globally are pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions despite this growth in demand for power.  These trends are increasingly favorable to nuclear power.  The United Kingdom illustrates this trend, with a recently announced energy policy that places a much greater reliance on nuclear power and unveiled plans for a new nuclear fleet, while slashing subsidies for solar energy and seeking to phase out coal fired power plants.  With plans to build at least three new nuclear plants, the UK plans to add 16GWe of new nuclear capacity operating by 2030 according to World Nuclear Association.
 There are currently 59 nuclear plants under construction in 14 countries, including 21 in China, seven in Russia, five in India and four in the United Arab Emirates according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  Four reactors are currently under construction in the U.S. including two for Southern Nuclear at the Vogtle, Georgia site and two at SCANA's VC Summer site.  Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar generating facility is up and running which represents a watershed for the US nuclear power industry.  According to the World Nuclear Association, there are 164 reactors in 25 countries in specific phases of planning that will be operating by 2030.  This pace of construction is surpassing the peak construction velocity of the 1970s and 1980s.

In addition to new plants, generating more power through enhanced plant performance - especially reducing unplanned outage time - is a critical objective for the nuclear power industry to meet growing global electricity demand.  Capacity factors, also known as load factors, have been greater than 90% in the U.S. in five of the seven years from 2007 to 2013.  The U.S. is recognized as the leader in load factor performance.  The U.S. accounts for nearly one-third of the world's nuclear electricity, highlighting its importance as a market as well as its need for high levels of performance.
 For the existing nuclear U.S. fleet, there is recognition that these plants are essential to meeting goals of reducing carbon emissions even as renewable energy sources are introduced.  This recognition of the importance of nuclear providing zero-carbon baseload is demonstrated most recently by the state of New York's Clean Energy Standard that values the emission-free energy of New York's nuclear fleet and in so doing providing an emissions-free subsidy of 1.7¢/kWh.  This subsidy helps ensure the state's existing nuclear plants remain economically viable in an era of low cost natural gas and even with wind and solar receiving a subsidy of 4.5¢/kWh.  In addition, the Illinois Legislature on December 2, 2016, passed the Future Energy Jobs Bill, a measure that ensures the continued operation of the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear power plants in that state.  In a statement, the Nuclear Energy Institute said the bill's passage was a "remarkable moment" for the state and the nuclear industry. Gov. Bruce Rauner signed the bill into law on December 7, 2016.  The Future Energy Jobs Bill provides Exelon and Commonwealth Edison with a $235 million annual credit for the carbon-free energy produced by the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants. The actions of New York and Illinois starts a trend which may continue to states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut to recognize the value of zero carbon power produced by nuclear plants in those states.  This would be similar to how the Renewable Portfolio Standard was rolled out across more than half the states in the US to recognize the benefits of zero carbon renewable power.
 In regulated markets where the economy is growing, the nuclear fleet is profitable and expanding, with four reactors under construction in the southeast U.S.  Longer term, the trends for nuclear power are favorable as well.  The U.S. Department of Energy recently released a draft plan to double America's nuclear power capacity by 2050.  The plan, dubbed "Vision 2050", promotes expanding America's nuclear capacity through advanced reactor designs including small and medium-size reactors.
 As countries around the world recognize the importance of lowering carbon emissions from power generation, nuclear energy is an essential component of the solution.  India and the UK have recently announced plans to significantly expand nuclear power generation capacity through new builds.  China continues to aggressively build out its fleet.  In Japan, the strategic importance of nuclear power had led the Institute of Energy and Economics to estimate that 19 of Japan's temporarily shut down reactors will restart before March 2018.
 We believe GSE is well positioned to take full advantage of these strategic global and domestic trends by providing high fidelity simulation and training solutions to the global power and process industries.

Products and Services
 Performance Improvement Solutions
 To assist our clients in creating world-class internal training and engineering improvement processes, we offer a set of integrated and scalable products and services which provide a structured program focused on continuous skills improvement for experienced employees to engineering services, which include plant design verification and validation.  We provide the right solution to solve our clients' most pressing needs.
 For workforce development and training, students and instructors alike must have a high degree of confidence that their power plant simulator truly reflects plant behavior across the entire range of operations.  To achieve this, GSE's simulation solution starts with the most robust engineering approach possible.  Using state-of-the-art modeling tools combined with our leading nuclear power modeling expertise, GSE provides simulation solutions that achieve unparalleled fidelity and accuracy.  The solutions that GSE provides are also known for ease of use, resulting in increased productivity by end-users.  For these reasons, GSE has delivered more nuclear power plant simulators than any other company in the world.
 For virtual commissioning, designers of first-of-a-kind plants or existing plants need a highly accurate dynamic simulation platform to model a wide variety of design assumptions and concepts from control strategies to plant behavior to human factors.  Because new builds and upgrades to existing plants result in new technology being deployed, often involving the integration of disparate technologies for the first time, a high fidelity simulator allows designers to see the interaction between systems for the very first time.  With our combination of simulation technology and expert engineering, GSE was chosen to build first-of-a-kind simulators for the AP1000, PBMR, and small modular reactors being built by NuScale, and mPower.
 Examples of the types of simulators we sell include, but are not limited to, the following:
  
● | Universal Training Simulators: These products complement the Self-Paced Training Tutorials by reinforcing what the student learned in the tutorial, putting it into practice on the Universal Simulator. The simulation models are high fidelity and engineering correct, but represent a typical plant or typical process, rather than the exact replication of a client's plant. We have delivered over 250 such simulation models to clients consisting of major oil companies and educational institutions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Part-Task Training Simulators: Like the Universal Simulators, we provide other unique training solutions such as a generic nuclear plant simulator and VPanel® displays, which replicate control room hardware and simulator solutions specific to industry needs such as severe accident models to train on and aid in the understanding of events like the Fukushima Daiichi accident. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Plant-Specific Operator Training Simulators: These simulators provide an exact replication of the plant control room and plant operations. They provide the highest level of realism and training and allow users to practice their own plant-specific procedures. Clients can safely practice startup, shutdown, normal operations, as well as response to abnormal events we all hope they never have to experience in real life. Since our inception, we have delivered nearly 450 plant-specific simulators to clients in the nuclear power, fossil power and process industries worldwide.

Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting
 As our customers' experienced staff retire, access to experts that can help train existing and new employees in how to operate their plants is essential to ensure safe ongoing plant operations.  In addition, training needs change over time and sometimes our clients require specialized courses.  Industry needs instructors who can step in and use the client's training material.  Finding professional instructors, who know the subject, can teach it and can adapt to the client's culture, is critical.  GSE provides both qualified instructors and turnkey courses that work within the client's system and complement the training methods they already have in place.  Examples of our training program courses are senior reactor operator certification, generic fundamentals training, and simulation supervisor training.  In addition, we also provide expert support through consulting or turnkey projects for the training material upgrade and development, outage execution, planning and scheduling, corrective actions programs, and equipment reliability.

Other | 4% | 5% 
Total | 100% | 100%

Backlog.  As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $73.2 million of total gross revenue backlog compared to $47.9 million as of December 31, 2015.  Most of our contracts range from 9 to 24 months. With respect to our backlog, it includes only those amounts that have been funded and authorized and does not reflect the full amounts we may receive over the term of such contracts.  Our backlog includes future expected revenue at contract rates, excluding contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of the client.  We calculate backlog without regard to possible project reductions or expansions or potential cancellations unless and until such changes may occur.
 Backlog is expressed in terms of gross revenue and, therefore, may include significant estimated amounts of third-party or pass-through costs to subcontractors and other parties.  Because backlog is not a defined accounting term, our computation of backlog may not necessarily be comparable to that of our industry peers.
 Employees.  As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 272 employees, which include approximately 188 in our Performance Improvement segment and 84 in our Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment.  In addition we have approximately 100 licensed engineers and other advanced degreed professionals.  Excluding our Hyperspring business, which consists primarily of contracted instructors, our employee attrition rate for 2016 among all staff was approximately 10%.  To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed and we expect our growth efforts to be addressed through attracting top talent.

GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 December 31, 2016 and 2015
 
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Principles of consolidation
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GSE Systems, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "the Company"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, and less-than-majority owned subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.
 
Accounting estimates
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates used, including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of future warranty costs, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets and contingent consideration to be paid in business acquisitions, valuation of stock based compensation awards, and income taxes.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
Revenue recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue through fixed price contracts for the sale of uniquely designed/customized systems containing hardware, software and other materials which generally apply to the Performance Improvement Solutions segment and time and material contracts for Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting support and service agreements.
 In accordance with ASC 605-35, Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts (ASC 605), the Performance Improvement Solutions segment accounts for revenue under fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method.  This methodology recognizes revenue and earnings as work progresses on the contract and is based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated cost to complete the project.  Estimated contract earnings are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses, and the cumulative effect of any change in estimate is recognized in the period in which the change is identified.  Estimated losses are charged against earnings in the period such losses are identified.  The Company recognizes revenue arising from contract claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and realization is probable and there is a legal basis of the claim.
 Uncertainties inherent in the performance of contracts include labor availability and productivity, material costs, change order scope and pricing, software modification and customer acceptance issues.  The reliability of these cost estimates is critical to the Company's revenue recognition as a significant change in the estimates can cause the Company's revenue and related margins to change significantly from the amounts estimated in the early stages of the project.
 As the Company recognizes revenue under the percentage-of-completion method, it provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical and projected claims experience.  The Company's long-term contracts generally provide for a one to five year warranty on the systems sold to customers to cover hardware or software issues.
 The Company's system design contracts do not normally provide for post contract support (PCS) in terms of software upgrades, software enhancements or telephone support.  In order to obtain PCS, the customers must normally purchase a separate contract.  Such PCS arrangements are generally for a one-year period renewable annually and include customer support, unspecified software upgrades, and maintenance releases.  The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts ratably over the life of the agreements.
 Revenue from the sale of software licenses without other elements in the contract and which do not require significant modifications or customization for the Company's modeling tools are recognized when the license agreement is signed, the license fee is fixed and determinable, delivery has occurred, and collection is considered probable.  We utilize written contracts as a means to establish the terms and conditions by which product support and services are sold to customers.  Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer.
 The Company also recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses from contracts with multiple deliverables.  These software license sales are evaluated under ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition.  Contracts with multiple element arrangements typically include, but are not limited to, components such as installation, training, licenses, and PCS listed in the contract.  The Company concluded that vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) does not exist for all elements of its software license sales.  If a PCS or professional services element exists in the software license arrangement, revenue is recognized ratably over the longest service period.  If no PCS or professional services element exists in the arrangement, revenue is deferred until the last undelivered element is delivered.
 The Company recognizes revenue under time and materials contracts primarily from the Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment and certain cost-reimbursable contracts.  Revenue on time and material contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed.  Under a typical time-and-materials billing arrangement, customers are billed on a regularly scheduled basis, such as biweekly or monthly.  Any unbilled amounts are typically billed the following month.  Under cost-reimbursable contracts, which are subject to a contract ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based.  However, if costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs.
 
 46
 
Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and highly liquid investments including money market accounts with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
 
Restricted cash
 
Restricted cash consists of the cash collateralization of outstanding letters of credit used for various advance payment, bid, surety and performance bonds, and negative foreign exchange positions which have been segregated into restricted money market accounts with BB&T Bank.  BB&T Bank has complete and unconditional control over the restricted money market accounts.
 At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had approximately $1.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of cash in escrow accounts with BB&T Bank.  We have classified all of our restricted cash as current assets at December 31, 2016, and classified as current assets $1.8 million of the total restricted cash at December 31, 2015, with the remaining amount classified as a long term asset. The Company recorded interest income of $6,000 and $10,000 from the escrow accounts for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The interest earned on these restricted funds is added to the restricted cash balance.  The Company classifies the restriction and release of the cash collateralization of outstanding letters of credit as an investing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows, as these deposits are not related to borrowings against our line of credit.
 
Contract receivables, net
 
Contract receivables include recoverable costs and accrued profit not billed which represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed.  Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets represent advanced billings to clients on contracts in advance of work performed.  Generally, such amounts will be earned and recognized over the next twelve months.
 Billed receivables are recorded at invoiced amounts.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical trends of past due accounts, write-offs, and specific identification and review of customer accounts.
 
The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:

Current year write-offs | | (86 | ) | | | (20 | )
Ending balance | $ | 17 | | | $ | 103 | 

 
Equipment, software and leasehold improvements, net
 
Equipment and purchased software are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method with estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method.  Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
 
 47
 
Software development costs
 
Certain computer software development costs are capitalized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is commercially available for general release to customers.  Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in cost of revenue and is determined using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, typically three years.  On an annual basis, and more frequently as conditions indicate, the Company assesses the recovery of the unamortized software development costs by estimating the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the sale of the product.  If the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized software costs the Company will write-down the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated fair value based on the future discounted cash flows.  The excess of any unamortized computer software costs over the related fair value is written down and charged to operations.
 
Development expenditures
 
Development expenditures incurred to meet customer specifications under contracts are charged to contract costs.  Company sponsored development expenditures are either charged to operations as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses or are capitalized as software development costs.  See Note 7, Software development costs, net.  The amounts incurred for Company sponsored development activities relating to the development of new products and services or the improvement of existing products and services, were approximately $1.6 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  Of this amount, the Company capitalized approximately $0.2 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Impairment of long-lived assets
 
Long-lived assets, such as equipment, purchased software, capitalized software development costs, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.  Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
 
During the third quarter of 2015, the Company's new CEO conducted a review of the Company's organizational cost structure and software development plans.  Based upon this review, the Company made the decision to terminate its Enterprise Data Management (EDM) software development program and recorded a $1.5 million write-down representing the capitalized balance of its EDM software development projects in the third quarter 2015.  No impairment was recorded during 2016.
  48
 

Goodwill and intangible assets
 
The Company's intangible assets include amounts recognized in connection with business acquisitions, including customer relationships, contract backlog and software.  Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset.  Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets, except for contract backlog and contractual customer relationships which are recognized in proportion to the related projected revenue streams.  Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise.  The Company does not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
 Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired.  The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU)  2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, and ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (ASC 350).  The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level.
 ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.  Under ASU 2011-08, an entity is not required to perform step one of the goodwill impairment test for a reporting unit if it is more likely than not that its fair value is greater than its carrying amount.  For the annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2016, the Company performed a quantitative step one goodwill impairment test and concluded that the fair values of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values.  
 Foreign currency translation
 
Balance sheet accounts for foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, and income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.  The resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates are recorded in our statements of operations in the year in which they occur.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, foreign currency transaction losses were approximately $69,000 and $34,000, respectively.
 
 49
 
Accrued warranty
 
For contracts that contain a warranty provision, the Company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience and projected claims.  The Company's contracts may contain warranty provisions from one to five years.  The current portion of the accrued warranty is presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Current liabilities whereas the noncurrent portion is included in Other liabilities.
 
The activity in the accrued warranty accounts is as follows:

Currency adjustment | | (24 | ) | | | (13 | )
Ending balance | $ | 1,478 | | | $ | 1,614 | 

 
Income taxes
 
Income taxes are provided under the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  A provision is made for the Company's current liability for federal, state and foreign income taxes and the change in the Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
 
We establish accruals for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Favorable or unfavorable adjustment of the accrual for any particular issue would be recognized as an increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period of a change in facts and circumstances. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are accounted for as income tax expense.
 
Stock-based compensation
 
Compensation expense related to share based awards is recognized on a pro rata straight-line basis based on the value of share awards that are scheduled to vest during the requisite service period.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of pre-tax stock-based compensation expense under the fair value method.   During 2016, the Company recognized approximately $151,000 of compensation expense related to cash-settled RSUs.
 
 50
 
Earnings (loss) per share
 
Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of outstanding common shares for the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share adjusts the weighted average shares outstanding for the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding vested stock options were exercised.  Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares for the period.
 
The number of common shares and common share equivalents used in the determination of basic and diluted loss per share were as follows:

Conversion of certain outstanding stock options was not assumed for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.
 
Significant customers and concentration of credit risk
 
We have a concentration of revenue from an individual customer, which accounted for approximately 10.2% and 15.9% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2016 or 2015.

Fair values of financial instruments
 
The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to their short term duration.
 
Contingent consideration for business acquisitions
 
Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on future financial measures of an acquired company. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Company estimates the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation is revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition are reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations, and could cause a material impact to our operating results. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria.
 
Derivative instruments
 
The Company utilizes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. It is the Company's policy to use such derivative financial instruments to protect against market risk arising in the normal course of business in order to reduce the impact of these exposures. The Company minimizes credit exposure by limiting counterparties to nationally recognized financial institutions.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had foreign exchange contracts outstanding of approximately 281.4 million Japanese Yen, 0.6 million Australian Dollars, 0.5 million Canadian Dollars, and 0.1 million Euro.  At December 31, 2015, the Company had foreign exchange contracts outstanding of approximately 2.1 million Euro, 1.3 million Canadian Dollars, 0.5 million Pounds Sterling and 0.4 million Australian Dollars at fixed rates. The contracts expire on various dates through December 2018.  The Company had not designated the foreign exchange contracts as hedges and had recorded the estimated fair value of the contracts in the consolidated balance sheet as follows:
 

 | December 31, | 
------------------------------------------+--------------+----
(in thousands) | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
Asset derivatives | | | | | 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets | $ | 57 | | | $ | 115 | 
Other assets | | 84 | | | | 6 |

Liability derivatives | | | | | | | 
Other current liabilities | | (20 | ) | | | (57 | )
 | | (20 | ) | | | (57 | )
Net fair value | $ | 121 | | | $ | 64 | 

 
 52
 
The changes in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts are included in gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
 The foreign currency denominated trade receivables, unbilled receivables, billings in excess of revenue earned and subcontractor accruals that are related to the outstanding foreign exchange contracts are remeasured at the end of each period into the functional currency using the current exchange rate at the end of the period.  The gain or loss resulting from such remeasurement is also included in gain (loss) on derivative instruments net in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a loss on its derivative instruments net as outlined below:

Reclassifications
 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.  Subcontractor payables have been reclassified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from Accounts payable to Accrued expenses.  In addition, the Company reclassified research and development costs from Selling, general and administrative expenses and presented them as a separate caption within Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The Company also reclassified the current portion of deferred taxes to noncurrent within Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
Accounting pronouncements recently adopted
 
In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The standard requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and noncurrent.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.
 
 53
 
Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today's guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. This guidance will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and its method of adoption.  The adoption is expected to significantly impact the Company's revenue recognition and related disclosures.  For example, our revenue from software arrangements with multiple elements including services are currently recognized ratably due to the lack of VSOE of fair value.  We will be required to separate these performance obligations under these arrangements and recognize them as delivered.
 
In July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  ASU 2015-11 requires that an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  This ASU does not apply to inventory measured using last-in, first-out.  ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  We do not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements, and the Company expects that upon adoption the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities could be material.
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Topic 718: Improvements to Employee Share Based Accounting.  The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for share based payment award transactions.  The amendments in the update include the following aspects for share based accounting: accounting for income taxes, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes.  Adoption of ASU 2016-09 is required for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.
 
 54
 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues and applies to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows.  Adoption of ASU 2016-15 is required for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Restricted Cash.  The new guidance applies to all entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents and are required to present a statement of cash flows.  This update is intended to reduce diversity in cash flow presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents and requires entities to include all cash and cash equivalents, both restricted and unrestricted, in the beginning-of-period and end-of-period totals presented on the statement of cash flows.  Adoption of ASU 2016-18 is required for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-18 on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the definition of a Business, which amends the current definition of a business. Under ASU 2017-01, to be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contributes to the ability to create outputs.  ASU 2017-01 further states that when substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquitted is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business.  The new guidance also narrows the definition of the term "outputs" to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The changes to the definition of a business will likely result in more acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions. ASU 2017-01 is effective for acquisitions commencing on or after June 30, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  Adoption of this guidance will be applied prospectively on or after the effective date.
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other.  ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation.  Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the carrying value of the goodwill.  ASU 2017-04 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-04 on our consolidated financial statements.

2.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill
 
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment, as defined by U.S. GAAP. After the acquisition of Hyperspring on November 14, 2014, the Company determined that it had two reporting units, which are the same as our two operating segments: (i) Performance Improvement Solutions; and (ii) Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting (which includes Hyperspring).  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, goodwill of $5.6 million related to the Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment.  No impairment of goodwill was recorded in 2016 or 2015.

8.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ("ASC 820") defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principle or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
 
The levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820 are:
 
Level 1:  inputs are quoted prices, unadjusted, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
 
Level 2:  inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  A Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
 
Level 3:  inputs are unobservable and reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
 
The Company considers the recorded value of certain of its financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.
 
The Company had $15.3 million and $5.4 million deposited in unrestricted money market accounts on December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable for four standby letters of credit and one surety bond totaling $1.0 million which represent advance payment and performance bonds on four contracts.  The Company has deposited the full value of the standby letters of credit into money market escrow accounts, which have been restricted in that the Company may not access these funds until the related letters of credit have expired. The cash has been recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash and long-term restricted cash depending on the expiration date of the underlying letters of credit.

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any transfers between fair value Level 1 and Level 2.  The Company did not hold any non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis at December 31, 2016 or 2015.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any transfers into or out of the Level 3 contingent consideration liability.  The decrease in the liability during 2016 and 2015 was due to accretion of the liability and fair value adjustments, which were all recorded to income.

9.  Long-Term Debt
 
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no long-term debt.
 
Line of Credit
 
BB&T Bank
 
We previously had a Master Loan and Security Agreement and Revolving Credit Note with BB&T that provided a $7.5 million revolving line of credit for the purpose of issuing stand-by letters of credit and providing working capital.  Working capital advances accrued interest at a rate equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate of Interest, floating with a floor of 4.5%.  As collateral for any borrowings, the Company granted a first lien and security interest in all of the assets of the Company, including but not limited to, accounts receivable, proceeds and products, intangibles, trademarks, patents, intellectual property, machinery and equipment.  The agreement also required certain cash collateral and compliance with certain restrictive covenants.
 
In connection with the Citizen's Bank credit facility noted below, this agreement was modified in December 2016 to terminate the revolving line of credit, but maintain the outstanding letters of credit through February 17, 2017.
 
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the cash collateral account totaled $1.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively, and was classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants.
 
Citizen's Bank
 
In December 2016, the Company entered into a new three-year, $5.0 million revolving line of credit facility with Citizen's Bank to fund general working capital needs, including acquisitions.  The available credit facility is reduced for any issued and outstanding letters of credit and working capital advances.  Working capital advances bear interest of LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum and letter of credit fees are 1.25% per annum.  The Company is not required to maintain a restricted cash collateral account at Citizen's Bank for outstanding letters of credit and working capital advances.  The credit facility agreement is subject to standard financial covenants and reporting requirements.
10.  Income Taxes
 
The consolidated income (loss) before income taxes, by domestic and foreign sources, is as follows:

The Company is entitled to a deduction for federal and state tax purposes with respect to employees' stock option activity.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $5.6 million of unrecognized excess tax deductions related to compensation for stock option exercises which will be recognized when the net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized and those excess tax benefits result in a reduction to income taxes payable.
 
The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 differed from the statutory federal income tax rate as presented below:

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future income in making this assessment.
 Management believes that the Company will achieve profitable operations in future years that will enable the Company to recover the benefit of its deferred tax assets. However, other than for a portion of the deferred tax assets that are related to the Company's Indian subsidiary, the Company presently does not have sufficient objective evidence to substantiate the recovery of the deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, the Company has established a full $10.5 million valuation allowance on its U.S., U.K., Swedish, and Chinese deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016.
 The Company has a deferred tax liability in the amount of $316,000 and $170,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relating to the tax amortization of goodwill that cannot be offset by deferred tax assets because the anticipated reversal of the deferred tax liability is outside of the anticipated reversal of the deferred tax assets.
 As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $21.7 million and $11.1 million, respectively, including cash and cash equivalents held at non-U.S. entities totaling $4.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively.  The Company has foreign operating subsidiaries located in China, United Kingdom, Sweden and India.  A deferred tax asset has been recorded with respect to the undistributed earnings in Sweden in the amount of $109,000.  The Company has two foreign subsidiaries located in China and United Kingdom with accumulated deficits.  The Company has one foreign subsidiary located in India that has undistributed earnings of $644,000 at December 31, 2016.  If the Company were to repatriate these earnings it would incur taxes of approximately $331,000.  The foreign subsidiaries in China, United Kingdom, and India have undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2016, to fund the Company's ongoing international operations.
  64
 

At December 31, 2016, the Company's largest deferred tax asset of $7.9 million primarily relates to a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of $18.6 million which expires in various amounts between 2020 and 2035.  The amount of U.S. loss carryforward which can be used by the Company each year is limited due to changes in the Company's ownership which occurred in 2003.  Thus, a portion of the Company's loss carryforward may expire unutilized.
 
Uncertain Tax Positions
 
Foreign Uncertain Tax Positions
 
During 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded tax liabilities for certain foreign tax contingencies.  During 2016, the Company also determined that South Korea should be included in this inventory.

11.  Capital Stock
 The Company's Board of Directors has authorized 32,000,000 total shares of capital stock, of which 30,000,000 are designated as common stock and 2,000,000 are designated as preferred stock.  The Board of Directors has the authority to establish one or more classes of preferred stock and to determine, within any class of preferred stock, the preferences, rights and other terms of such class.
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company has reserved 4,892,641 shares of common stock for issuance, 1,556,833 are reserved for shares upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and 1,688,480 are reserved for shares upon vesting of restricted stock units.  The Company has 1,647,328 shares available for future grants under the Company's 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
 Preferred Stock Rights
 On March 21, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend, payable to holders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2011, of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right) for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the Common Stock) and in addition, entered into a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement (as amended from time to time, the Rights Agreement) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent.  The Rights traded with and were inseparable from the Common Stock and were not evidenced by separate certificates.  Each Right entitled its holder to purchase from the Company one-hundredth of a share of participating preferred stock having economic and voting terms similar to the Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.00 per Right, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement, if the Rights had become exercisable.  Under the Rights Agreement, the Rights would have become exercisable if any person or group acquired 20% or more of the Common Stock or, in the case of any person or group that owned 20% or more of the Common Stock.  Upon exercise of the Right in accordance with the Rights Agreement, the holder was able to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock from the Company having an aggregate market price (as defined in the Rights Agreement) equal to twice the then-current exercise price for an amount in cash equal to the then-current exercise price.  In addition, the Company, in certain circumstances and pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, would have exchanged the Rights for one share of Common Stock or an equivalent security for each Right or, alternatively, redeemed the Rights for $0.001 per Right.
 On March 21, 2014, the Rights Agreement was amended to extend the term an additional two years.  At the close of business on March 21, 2016, the Rights and the Rights Agreement expired and no person retained any rights pursuant to the Rights Agreement or any Right.

12.  Stock-Based Compensation
 
Long-term incentive plan
 During 1995, the Company established the 1995 Long-Term Incentive Stock Option Plan (the Plan), which permits the granting of stock options (including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options) stock appreciation rights, restricted or unrestricted stock awards, phantom stock, performance awards or any combination of these to employees, directors or consultants.  The Plan expires on June 30, 2018; the total number of shares that could be issued under the Plan is 7,500,000.  As of December 31, 2016, 2,607,359 shares have been issued under the Plan, 1,556,833 stock options and  1,688,480 restricted stock units (RSUs) were outstanding under the Plan, while 1,647,328 shares remain for future grants under the Plan.
 
The Company recognizes compensation expense on a pro rata straight-line basis over the requisite service period for stock-based compensation awards with both graded and cliff vesting terms.  The Company recognizes the cumulative effect of a change in the number of awards expected to vest in compensation expense in the period of change.  The Company has not capitalized any portion of its stock-based compensation.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $1,550,000 and $541,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense under the fair value method.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, there was approximately $151,000 of stock-based compensation expense related to cash-settled RSUs.
 
Stock options
 
Options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock under the Plan expire in either seven or ten years from the date of grant and become exercisable in three, five, or seven installments with a certain percentage of options vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and additional options vesting on each of the subsequent anniversaries of the grant date, subject to acceleration under certain circumstances.

The Company uses a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the options at grant date based on the assumptions noted in the following table.  Volatility represents an average of market estimates for implied volatility of the Company's common stock.  The expected life is estimated based on an analysis of options already exercised and any foreseeable trends or changes in recipients' behavior.  The risk-free interest rate is an interpolation of the relevant U.S. Treasury security maturities as of each applicable grant date:
 

 | Years ended December 31,
----------------------------+-------------------------
 | 2016 | 2015 
Risk-free interest rates | 1.53% | 0.93 - 2.04% 
Dividend yield | 0% | 0% 
Expected life | 7.00 years | 3.03 - 7.00 years
Volatility | 49.05% | 45.94 - 49.44% 
Weighted average volatility | 49.05% | 47.45% 

 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $2.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of outstanding stock options and RSUs expected to be recognized on a pro-rata straight line basis over a weighted average remaining service period of approximately 5.45 years.
 
The Company received cash for the exercise price associated with stock options exercised of $833,000 and $23,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total intrinsic value realized by participants on stock options exercised was $407,566 and $6,000 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued RSUs to employees which vest upon the achievement of specific market-based or time-based measures.  The fair value for RSU's is calculated based on the stock price on the grant date and expensed ratably over the requisite service period, which ranges between one and five years.  The following table summarizes the information about vested and unvested restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Example training applications include turnkey and custom training services, while engineering services include plant design verification and validation. The Company provides these services across all market segments.  Contracts typically range from 9 months to 24 months.  The Company and its predecessors have been providing these services since 1976.
 
The Nuclear Industry Training and Consulting segment provides specialized workforce solutions primarily to the nuclear industry, working at clients' facilities.  This business is managed through our Hyperspring subsidiary.  The business model, management focus, margins and other factors clearly separate this business line from the rest of the GSE product and service portfolio.  Hyperspring has been providing these services since 2005.
