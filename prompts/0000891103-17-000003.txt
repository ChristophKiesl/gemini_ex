OVERVIEW
Who We Are
IAC is a leading media and Internet company comprised of widely known consumer brands, such as HomeAdvisor, Vimeo, Dictionary.com, The Daily Beast, Investopedia, and Match Group's online dating portfolio, which includes Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid.
For information regarding the results of operations of IAC’s segments, as well as their respective contributions to IAC’s consolidated results of operations, see “Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8-Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
All references to “IAC,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” in this report are to IAC/InterActiveCorp.
Our History
IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc. After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally, to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and Internet company.
From 1997 through 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group, Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com) and Expedia, as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies. In 2002, the Company contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, a joint venture, and sold its interests in that venture to NBC Universal in 2005.
In 2003, the Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire).
In 2005, IAC acquired Ask Jeeves, Inc. and completed the separation of its travel and travel‑related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc. In 2008, IAC separated into five independent, publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster (now Live Nation, Inc.) and Tree.com, Inc.
In 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic, a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a €5 million note. In 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation’s equity stake in IAC.
In 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%. In 2012, we acquired About.com. 
In 2014, we acquired the remaining publicly traded shares of Meetic, ValueClick’s “owned and operated” website businesses, including Investopedia and PriceRunner, and The Princeton Review.
In 2015, we acquired Plentyoffish Media Inc., a leading provider of subscription-based and ad-supported online personals servicing North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, for $575 million in cash, and completed the initial public offering of Match Group, Inc.
In 2016, we acquired VHX, a platform for premium over-the-top (OTT) subscription video channels, as well a controlling interest in MyHammer Holding AG, the leading home services marketplace in Germany, and sold PriceRunner, ASKfm and ShoeBuy.
EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND VOTE
IAC has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and shares of Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis. As of January 27, 2017, Mr. Diller, his spouse, Diane von Furstenberg, and his stepson, Alexander von Furstenberg, collectively beneficially owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock and 136,711 shares of IAC common stock, all of which were held in trusts for the benefit of Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, and 1,711 shares of IAC common stock held by a private foundation. As of that date, the shares of IAC Class B common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family collectively represented 100% of IAC’s outstanding Class B common stock and, together with the shares of IAC common stock also beneficially owned by these individuals, represented approximately 44.7% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC. Mr. Diller also holds 550,000 vested options and 750,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
2

In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC’s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) at least 5,000,000 shares of IAC Class B common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including IAC securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of him and certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
As a result of IAC securities beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, Mr. Diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC’s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.

DESCRIPTION OF IAC BUSINESSES
Match Group
Overview
Our Match Group segment includes the dating and non-dating businesses of Match Group, Inc. (“Match Group”), which completed its initial public offering on November 24, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, IAC’s ownership interest and voting interest in Match Group were 82.5% and 97.9%, respectively.
Services
Dating.  Through Match Group, we operate a dating business that consists of a portfolio with over 45 brands, available in 42 languages, and offered in over 190 countries, including the following key brands: Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish, Meetic, OkCupid, Pairs, Twoo, OurTime, BlackPeopleMeet and LoveScout24. We operate a North America dating business, which includes Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid, our various affinity brands and other dating businesses operating within the United States and Canada, and an International dating business, which includes Meetic, Pairs, Twoo, the international operations of Tinder and PlentyOfFish and all other dating businesses operating outside of the United States and Canada.
Through the brands within our dating business, we are a leading provider of membership-based and ad-supported dating products servicing North America, Western Europe and many other regions around the world. We provide these services through websites and applications that we own and operate. 
All of our dating products enable users to establish a profile and review other people’s profiles without charge. Each product also offers additional features, some of which are free, and some of which require payment depending on the particular product. In general, access to premium features requires a paid membership, which is typically offered in packages (primarily ranging from one month to six months), depending on the product and circumstance. Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of membership purchased, by the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access, and by whether or not a customer is taking advantage of any special offers. In addition to paid memberships, many of our dating products offer users the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time, or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other members, and these features are offered on a pay‑per‑use basis. The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand‑by‑brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution.
Non-Dating. In addition to our dating business, we also operate a non‑dating business through Match Group’s ownership of The Princeton Review, which provides a variety of educational test preparation, academic tutoring and college counseling services. The Princeton Review includes Tutor.com (acquired in 2012) and The Princeton Review (acquired in 2014). In January 2017, Match Group entered into a definitive agreement to sell The Princeton Review to ST Unitas, a global education technology company. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017.
Revenue
The substantial majority of the Match Group segment’s revenue is attributable to the dating business. Dating business revenue is substantially derived directly from users in the form of recurring membership fees for subscription-based online personals and related services. Revenue is also earned from online advertising, the purchase of à la carte features and offline events. Non-dating revenue consists primarily of fees received directly from students for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services.
Marketing
We attract the majority of users of our dating products through word‑of‑mouth and other free channels. In addition, many of our brands rely on paid customer acquisition for a significant percentage of their users. Our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing banner and other display advertising, search engine marketing, e-mail campaigns and business development or partnership deals. Our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts, as well as events.
Competition
The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand globally. We compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products. In addition to other online dating brands, we compete indirectly with offline dating services, such as in‑person matchmakers, and social media platforms. Arguably, our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other, and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services.
4

We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | our ability to increase consumer acceptance of dating products;


• | the continued strength of Match Group’s brands;


• | the breadth and depth of Match Group’s active communities of users relative to those of its competitors;


• | our ability to evolve our dating products in response to competitors’ offerings, user requirements, social trends and the technological landscape;


• | our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our dating products;


• | our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies; and


• | the design and functionality of our dating products.

HomeAdvisor
Overview
HomeAdvisor is a leading global home services digital marketplace that helps connect consumers with home professionals in North America, as well as in France, the Netherlands and Italy under various brands. In November 2016, HomeAdvisor acquired a controlling interest in MyHammer Holding AG, the leading home services marketplace in Germany.
As of December 31, 2016, HomeAdvisor’s domestic network of home services professionals consisted of approximately 143,000 paying professionals in the United States providing services in more than 500 categories ranging from simple home repairs to larger home remodeling projects. HomeAdvisor generated approximately 13.2 million domestic service requests from homeowners during the year ended December 31, 2016. HomeAdvisor also operates Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service, CraftJack, a lead generation service, and mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud based field service software for small to mid-size businesses.
Consumer Services
Matching Services. When a consumer submits a request through the HomeAdvisor marketplace, we generally match that consumer with up to four home services professionals from our network based on the type of services desired and the consumer’s location. Consumers can then review profiles of home services professionals with whom they have been matched and select the professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. In addition to (or in lieu of) submitting a request through our marketplace, consumers can also search, select and contact home service professionals directly through our online directory. In all cases, the consumer is under no obligation to work with home service professionals referred by or found through HomeAdvisor.
On-Demand Services. HomeAdvisor also provides two on-demand services that complement its matching services: Instant Booking and Instant Connect (patent-pending). Through Instant Booking, consumers can schedule appointments for select home tasks on-demand with a pre-screened home services professional instantly across our platforms (website or mobile application), and through Instant Connect, consumers can connect with a home services professional instantly via phone. 
Other Services. In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access our free, online True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types on a local basis, as well as an online library of home services‑related resources, which primarily includes articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with home services professionals.
Consumers can also access HomeAdvisor services and tools on iOS and Android devices (including the Apple Watch®) and through HomeAdvisor's mobile application, as well as access its Instant Connect service through Amazon's Echo product.
Subscription Services for Home Services Professionals 
Home services professionals who are new to HomeAdvisor must sign up for an annual membership package. Our basic annual membership package includes membership in our network of home services professionals, as well as a listing in our online directory and matches through the marketplace. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 93% of the approximately 143,000 domestic paying home services professionals within our network had purchased a membership package. We also offer subscription products that include custom website and mobile development and hosting services, as well as integration with mHelpDesk. 
5

Revenue
The HomeAdvisor segment’s revenue is primarily derived from fees paid by home services professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service), subscription fees and fees for website hosting services. Fees for matches vary based upon the service requested, type of match and where the service is provided.
Marketing
We market our services to consumers primarily through television advertising, as well as through search engine marketing and affiliate agreements with third parties. Pursuant to these agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote our services and those of our home services professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through our website (on a cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to our website (on a cost-per-click basis). We also market our services to consumers through e-mails, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through direct mail and radio advertising. We market our subscription packages to home services professionals primarily through our sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations.
Competition
We compete with home services-related lead generation services, as well as Internet search engines and directories and with other forms of local advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the size, quality (as determined, in part, by reference to our pre-screening efforts and customer ratings and reviews), diversity and stability of our network of home services professionals and the quality of the services they provide;


• | our continued ability to deliver service requests that convert into revenue for our network of home services professionals in a cost-effective manner;


• | whether our subscription products resonate with (and provide value to) our home services professionals;


• | the functionality of our websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our services generally to consumers and home services professionals, as well as our ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and home services professionals; and


• | our ability to build and maintain awareness of (and loyalty to) the HomeAdvisor brand.

Video
Overview
Our Video segment consists primarily of Vimeo, Electus, CollegeHumor, Notional, IAC Films and Daily Burn.
Vimeo
Services. Vimeo operates a global video sharing platform for creators and their audiences. Through Vimeo, we offer video creators simple, professional grade tools to share, manage, distribute and monetize content online, and provide viewers with a clutter-free environment to watch content across a variety of Internet-enabled devices, including mobile devices and connected television platforms. We offer these basic services free of charge. 
We also offer premium services through subscription products, which provide paying subscribers with various levels of premium features, including: additional video storage space, advanced video privacy controls, extensive video player customization options, team collaboration, review and workflow tools, e-mail lead generation, premium support and the ability to sell videos and OTT video channels (through VHX, a platform for premium OTT subscription video channels that we acquired in 2016), directly to consumers. As of December 31, 2016, Vimeo had approximately 768,000 paid subscribers and reached over 240 million unique users worldwide. 
We also provide on-demand services through which video creators can sell videos they create to consumers. As of December 31, 2016, our on-demand services featured over 60,000 titles in a variety of genres from more than 15,000 creators and sold titles to more than 2.8 million consumers. Titles are added to our Video On Demand marketplace by video creators through direct uploads to www.vimeo.com and through negotiated agreements with content owners, producers and distributors to acquire titles.
6

We also provide tools through which video owners and distributors can offer branded, over-the-top (OTT) video channels directly to consumers. Video owners and distributors can offer their content on a subscription or à la carte basis through applications for all major mobile and set top box platforms.
Marketing. We market Vimeo’s services primarily through online marketing efforts, including search engine marketing, social media, e-mail campaigns, display advertising and affiliate marketing, as well as through offline advertising and upgrade channels on the Vimeo platform (website and mobile application).
Revenue. Vimeo revenue is derived primarily from subscription fees and, to a lesser extent, from video sales and OTT service fees.
Competition. Vimeo competes with a variety of online video providers, including those that serve video creators and consumers through advertising-supported, subscription or transactional fee models. We believe that Vimeo differentiates itself from its competitors by offering a customizable, high definition video player, proprietary uploading and encoding infrastructure and a clutter-free viewing experience (advertisements are not placed in video streams on www.vimeo.com). We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily on:

• | the quality of our technology platform and the viewing and production experiences we provide consumers and video creators and distributors across Internet-connected devices (desktop, mobile and television);


• | whether our subscription and OTT offerings resonate with video creators and distributors;


• | our ability to attract high-quality content, both for free and fee-based viewing;


• | the accessibility of our videos on search engines and social media platforms;


• | the recognition and strength of the Vimeo brand relative to those of our competitors; and


• | our ability to drive new subscribers and viewers to our platform through various forms of direct advertising.

Electus
Services. Through Electus, we provide production and producer services for both unscripted and scripted television, feature film and digital content, primarily for initial sale and distribution in the United States. Our content is distributed on a wide range of platforms, including broadcast television, premium and basic cable television, subscription-based and ad-supported video-on-demand services and through theatrical releases and other outlets. We sell and distribute Electus programming and other content, together with programming and other content developed by third parties, outside of the United States through Electus International. We also work with various brands to integrate their products into, as well as sponsor, Electus content through our Content Marketing team.
In addition, we operate Electus Digital, which consists of the following websites and properties: CollegeHumor.com, Dorkly.com and WatchLOUD.com; YouTube channels WatchLOUD, Nuevon and Hungry; and Big Breakfast (a production company). The various brands and businesses within Electus Digital specialize in creating content for digital, television and feature film platforms across a variety of genres, as well as provide branded and third party creative production services. Through Electus, we also operate Notional.
Revenue. Electus revenue is derived primarily from media production and distribution and display advertising.
Marketing. We do not engage in any formal marketing efforts in the case of our production and executive producer services, instead relying on referrals and the quality of our services and projects. For content distribution, we rely on our sales force, referrals and the quality of our services and projects, and for international distribution only, attendance at industry trade shows. In addition, the platforms to which we license our content for distribution market our content through their own independent marketing efforts. Electus Digital attracts users and audience primarily through social media, search engine marketing and affiliate agreements.
Competition. We compete with entertainment studios, production companies, distribution companies, creative agencies and content websites. We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the quality and diversity of our content and the third parties to whom we license our content, as well as the quality of the services provided by licensees of our content;


• | our continued ability to create new content that resonates with licensees and viewers; and


• | our ability to sell integration and sponsorship opportunities for our content.

Daily Burn
Services. Daily Burn is a health and fitness property that provides streaming fitness and workout videos across a variety of platforms, including iOS, Android, Roku and other Internet-enabled television platforms.
7

Revenue. Daily Burn’s revenue consists primarily of subscription fees.
Marketing. We market our streaming fitness and workout videos primarily through television advertising, advertising on ad-supported video-on-demand services and content platforms and search engine marketing.
Competition. The fitness and workout market is highly competitive and barriers to entry, particularly in the case of online platforms, are minimal. We compete primarily with other streaming fitness and workout platforms and, to a lesser extent, fitness and workout DVDs.

Applications    
Overview
Our Applications segment consists of:

• | Consumer, which includes our direct-to-consumer downloadable desktop applications, Apalon, which houses our mobile applications, and SlimWare; and


• | Partnerships, which includes our business-to-business partnership operations.

Consumer
Through our Consumer business, we develop, market and distribute a variety of applications, including desktop applications that are tailored to a number of specific online uses and through which users can access search services. The majority of our applications are browser extensions, which consist of a browser tab page and related technology that together enable users to run search queries directly from their web browsers. Many of our browser extensions are coupled with other applications that we have developed that provide users with access to various forms of content and software capabilities. These applications include: FromDoctoPDF, through which users can convert documents from one format into various others and share them across multiple platforms; MapsGalaxy, through which users can access accurate street maps, local traffic conditions and aerial and satellite street views; and WeatherBlink, through which users can access local weather conditions and satellite radar maps directly from their web browsers. Other applications target users with a special or passionate interest in select vertical categories (such as recipes, entertainment and religion, among others) or provide users with particular reference information or access to specific capabilities (such as internet speed and package tracking, among others). We distribute our utility applications directly to consumers free of charge.
Apalon is an award-winning mobile development company with one of the largest and most popular portfolios of mobile applications worldwide. SlimWare is a provider of community-powered software and services that clean, repair, update and optimize personal computers. 
Partnerships
Through our Partnerships business, we work closely with partners in the software, media and other industries to design and develop customized browser‑based search applications to be bundled and distributed with these partners’ products and services.
Revenue
Substantially all of the Applications segment's revenue consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites. Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by advertisers. The substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by our Applications businesses are supplied to us by Google Inc. ("Google") in the manner provided by and pursuant to a services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2020. The Company may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.
 Pursuant to this agreement, those of our Applications businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results. This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries. Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages. Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our Applications businesses and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us. We recognize paid listing revenue from Google when it delivers the user's click. In cases where the user’s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs. See “Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
To a significantly lesser extent, the Applications segment's revenue also consists of fees related to subscription downloadable applications, fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications and display advertisements.
Competition
We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to develop, market and distribute applications and related technology directly and through third parties. Competitors of our Applications businesses include Google, Yahoo!, 
9

Bing and other third party browser extension, convenience search and applications providers and other search technology and convenience service providers.
Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Applications businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
We believe that the ability of our Applications businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to:

• | create browser extensions and other applications that resonate with consumers (which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features, content and services, some of which may be owned by third parties, with quality search services);


• | maintain industry-leading monetization solutions for our applications;


• | differentiate our browser extensions and other applications from those of our competitors (primarily through providing customized browser tab pages and access to multiple search and other services through our browser extensions);


• | secure cost-effective distribution arrangements with third parties; and


• | market and distribute our browser extensions and other applications directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner.

Publishing
Overview
Our Publishing segment consists of:

• | our Premium Brands business, which includes About.com, Dictionary.com, Investopedia and The Daily Beast; and


• | our Ask & Other business, which primarily includes Ask.com and CityGrid.

Our Publishing businesses publish digital content and/or provide search services to users. Those of our Publishing businesses that publish digital content (our Premium Brands) generate such content through various sources, including, for example, through a network of “experts” in the case of About.com and internal editorial staff in the case of The Daily Beast, and/or acquire such content (or the rights to publish such content) from third parties. Those of our Publishing businesses that provide search services generally generate and display of a set of algorithmic search results, or hyperlinks to websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users. In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries. The paid listings displayed by our Publishing businesses are supplied to us by Google in the manner provided by and pursuant to our services agreement with Google, which is described above.
Premium Brands
Our Premium Brands business primarily consists of the following destination websites:

• | About.com, which provides detailed information and content written by independent, freelance subject matter experts;


• | Dictionary.com, which primarily provides online and mobile dictionary, thesaurus and reference services;


• | Investopedia, a resource for investment and personal finance education and information; and


• | The Daily Beast, a website dedicated to news, commentary, culture and entertainment that curates and publishes existing and original online content from its own roster of contributors in the United States.

During 2016, About.com evolved from a general content website to a collection of vertical brands by transitioning content from the various network channels on its general content website to stand-alone vertical domains, each with its own unique branding and user experience. To date, content from four network channels (specifically, Health, Money, Tech, and Home) has been transitioned to four verticals (Verywell.com, TheBalance.com, Lifewire.com and TheSpruce.com, respectively). We currently intend to launch additional verticals in 2017. 
10

Ask & Other
Our Ask & Other business consists primarily of:

• | Ask.com, which provides general search services, as well as question and answer services that provide direct answers to natural-language questions; and


• | CityGrid, an advertising network that integrates local content and advertising for distribution to affiliated and third party publishers across web and mobile platforms.

Revenue
The Publishing segment's revenue consists principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, display advertisements (sold directly and through programmatic ad sales) and fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications. The substantial majority of the paid listings that our Publishing businesses display are supplied to us by Google in the manner provided by and pursuant to our services agreement with Google, which is described above. 
Competition
We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract and retain users and advertisers to our Publishing businesses.
In terms of publishing digital content, our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results in relevant vertical categories and social channels. In terms of providing search services, generally our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search‑centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications).
Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Publishing businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
We believe that the ability of our Publishing businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon:

• | the quality of the content and features on our various Publishing platforms (websites and mobile applications), and the attractiveness of the services provided by these platforms generally, relative to those of our competitors;


• | our ability to successfully generate and acquire content (or the rights thereto) in a cost-effective manner;


• | the relevance and authority of the content, search results and answers featured on our various Publishing platforms; and


• | our ability to successfully market the content and search services offered by our Publishing businesses in a cost-effective manner.

Other
Our Other segment consisted of ShoeBuy, an Internet retailer of footwear and related apparel and accessories, and PriceRunner, a shopping comparison website. PriceRunner was sold in March 2016 and ShoeBuy was sold in December 2016. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, IAC and its subsidiaries employed approximately 5,800 full-time employees and approximately 3,300 part-time employees. Substantially all of our part-time employees are employed by Match Group's non-dating businesses and perform academic tutoring, test preparation and college counseling services. IAC believes that it generally has good employee relationships.
