Item 1. Business.
General
 
We were incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada in 1984. In 2004, we changed our corporate jurisdiction from a British Columbia company to a Canadian corporation.  In December 2011, we amended our articles to change our name from “i-minerals inc.” to “I-Minerals Inc.”
 
The Company is engaged in the exploration, evaluation and development of our Helmer-Bovill industrial minerals property (the “Helmer-Bovill Property”).  The Helmer-Bovill Property, in which we hold a 100% interest, is comprised of 8 mineral leases totaling 3,483.15 acres located approximately 6 miles northwest of Bovill, Latah County, Idaho.  Since inception, the Company has been in the exploration stage but moved into the development stage in fiscal 2018.  In fiscal 2019, the Company reverted back to the evaluation stage.
 
Our principal executive office is located at Suite 880, 580 Hornby Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our telephone number is (877) 303-6573.  Our operations office is located at 13403 N. Government Way, #102, Hayden, Idaho.
 
To date, we have not earned significant revenues from the operation of our Helmer-Bovill Property.  Accordingly, we are dependent on debt and equity financing as our primary source of operating working capital.  Our capital resources are largely determined by the strength of the junior resource markets and by the status of our projects in relation to these markets, and its ability to compete for investor support of its projects.
 
Our Principal Projects
 
Our activities at the Helmer-Bovill Property are focused on developing the Bovill Project.
 
The Bovill Project
 
Our lead project, the Bovill Project, is a strategically located long term resource of quartz, potassium feldspar (“K-spar”), halloysite and kaolinite formed through weathering of a border phase of the Idaho Batholith causing all minerals to be contained within a fine white clay-sand mixture referred to as “primary clay.” The Bovill Project is located within 3 miles of state highways with electricity and natural gas already at the property boundary.
 
Since 2010, our exploration work has focused diamond drilling on the Bovill Project.  To date, a total of 322 diamond drill holes have been drilled totaling 35,909 feet.  As a result of these drill campaigns, four deposits have been identified: Kelly’s Hump, Kelly’s Hump South, Middle Ridge and WBL.
 
In June 2014, we completed an updated pre-feasibility study on the Bovill Kaolin Project (the “2014 PFS”) and on March 8, 2016, we announced the economic results of our initial feasibility study (the “2016 FS”).  However, based on the results of an updated independent market study it is apparent that fundamental changes in the businesses that consume our minerals has taken place over the past several years.  These changes include offshoring and reformulation wherein industries that had previously used K-spar for example have reformulated their production batches using alternate minerals.  Markets do exist for all of the minerals contained within the Bovill Kaolin Project but not in the volumes contemplated in the 2016 FS.  Accordingly, the 2016 FS is considered not to be current and should not be relied upon. 
 
The mineral resources stated in the 2016 FS remain current and have recently been re-stated in a standalone technical report prepared by SRK Consulting (U.S.) recently completed an updated resource estimate.  The updated mineral resource statement from this report, summarized below, contains the same tonnages and grades as were disclosed in the 2016 FS and is the basis of the reserves defined in the 2020 Pre-Feasibility Report.

2020 Pre-Feasibility Study
 
The Company engaged MillCreek Engineering of Salt Lake City, Utah to estimate the capital and operating costs for a smaller plant capable of producing up to 20,000 tons of metakaolin and 10,000 tons of halloysite per year.  The estimated Operating Costs and Capital Cost fell in line with expectations and the Company retained MillCreek to complete a Pre-Feasibility Study of a metakaolin and halloysite operation.  It is envisioned that the sand fraction (K-spar and quartz) will be screened and sold into lower value industrial applications. 
 
On March 3, 2020, we announced a pre-feasibility study of our metakaolin and halloysite operation (the “2020 PFS”).  The 2020 PFS was led by Millcreek Engineering, who were responsible for overall project management and the process plant and infrastructure design (including OPEX and CAPEX) and economic analyses.  Other engineering and geological services were provided by Mine Development Associates (mine modelling; ore scheduling; mineral reserve estimation); SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. (mineral resource estimation); and, HDR Engineering Inc. (environmental review).
 
Highlights of the PFS include:
 

• | 20% Pre-Tax IRR; 18% After Tax IRR 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
• | US$48.3 million Pre-Tax NPV; US$33.7 million After Tax NPV
• | Initial Capital Cost of US$48.3 million 
• | Total Life of Operation Capital Costs of US$54.2 million 
• | 25 year mine life with 1.04:1 strip ratio 

 The 2020 PFS is based on the production of two minerals, halloysite and kaolinite. The halloysite is beneficiated into two mineral products; HalloPure which is about 70% halloysite and 30% kaolinite and premium quality Ultra-Hallopure which is greater than 90% halloysite with the balance kaolinite. The quality of Bovill Halloysite is regarded as being exceptional and the research on halloysite applications has dramatically increased over the past 5 years involving polymers, filtration, extruded polystyrene insulation, green technology and life sciences. The kaolinite is flash calcined to produce metakaolin, a Supplementary Cementitious Material (“SCM”) and highly reactive pozzolan that when added to concrete increases strength and durability, reduces permeability, reduces the effect of alkali-silica reactivity and increases resistance to chloride ingress and sulfate attack. By using metakaolin the sustainability of the concrete is increased through longer service life and the carbon footprint is reduced by lowering the quantity of Portland cement. Feldspathic sand is produced during the production process which meets the specifications of a number of applications including arena sand, USGA bunker and top-dressing sand. There is a potential upside from sale of feldspathic sand which is not included in the project economics and accordingly the feldspathic sand is not included in the reserves. 
 
A conservative approach to the build-up of sales has been assumed with full production being achieved in the first quarter of the 5th year of operation as some product applications will require development. There is potential for full production to be achieved earlier which would have a corresponding positive effect on the NPV and IRR. 
 
Updated Measured and Indicated Resource Estimate
 

• | Measured Resources of 5.7 million tons containing 76.5% quartz/K-spar sand, 12.3% Kaolinite and 4.0% Halloysite. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Indicated Resources of 15.5 million tons containing 57.0% quartz/K-spar sand, 15.5% Kaolinite and 2.8% Halloysite. 
• | 667,000 tons of contained halloysite, 3,119,000 tons of contained kaolinite and 13,235,000 tons of contained quartz/K-spar.

Industrial Minerals
 
In carrying out our activities at the Bovill Project, we are focused on the evaluation of the economic viability of a smaller halloysite and metakaolin operation.
Kaolin and Metakaolin
 
Kaolin is a raw material used in the ceramic industry, especially in fine porcelains.  Large quantities of kaolin are used in paper coating, filler, paint, plastics, fiberglass, catalysts, and other specialty applications. It is also used as a key ingredient in natural pesticides that are suitable for organic farming applications.
 
When kaolin is heated to about 850°, it is transformed into a dehydrated phase called "metakaolin."  Metakaolin is considered a premium pozzolanic material as it adds strength and durability to cement based products.  When metakaolin is added to cement-based mortars, it causes an aggressive reaction with calcium hydroxide (lime), turning the lime into a cementitious material yielding cement with enhanced performance characteristics including increased strength; reduced permeability; greater durability; effective control of efflorescence; and control of degradation caused by Alkali-Silica Reaction.  A bridge deck in a northern climate where it is subject to the wear and tear associated with plowing and salting is a prime metakaolin application.  We are continuing long term testing process of several metakaolin products produced from the Bovill Project deposits and have received ASTM C-618 certification for two of our metakaolin products known as “I-POZZ” indicating I-POZZ is an accredited pozzolan that meets all strength and water consumption requirements.  ASTM C-618 certification is a prerequisite for sales into the cement industry.  Pilot plant testing of flash calcination technologies has lowered water consumption even further below ASTM C-618 standards.  Additional testing is focused on optimizing the fineness of the grind or particle size to create the metakaolin product that provides the greatest strength while meeting the water requirement criteria.
 
Our target market for metakaolin is the North American concrete and infrastructure industry.  Premium white metakaolin is currently priced at $400 - $500 per ton in the Pacific Northwest due to the transportation costs to bring it from the southeastern USA.  We are targeting applications where color is not as important.
 
Halloysite
 
We plan to sell Halloysite on a worldwide basis.  Halloysite is chemically identical to kaolin but morphologically different.  Kaolins tend to form plate like sheets whereas halloysite take on a tubular shape depending on the amount of H2O present in the interlayer.  Much of the value of halloysite is generated by its tubular shape which can only be seen through very powerful microscopes and are commonly referred to as halloysite nanotubes and abbreviated as HNTs. 
 
Historically, the primary use of halloysite has been in the manufacture of porcelain, bone china, and fine china where the combination of low iron and titanium content together with the hollow tubular shape of the mineral grains yields ceramic bodies with exceptional whiteness and translucency.  However, the HNTs microscopic tubular shape is rapidly finding uses outside of the ceramics industry.  Applications in commercial production would include use as a suspension agent in glaze preparations as well as in filters and inkjets, and as an ingredient in special paints applied to ships to prevent barnacles from growing on the ships’ hull.  HNTs are also being increasingly used in plastic and polymer applications where the addition of HNTs increases strength while reducing the weight of these compounds.  Perhaps the most exciting uses for HNTs are in life science applications where the inside of the hollow tube can be filled with active ingredients and as the clay tube erodes the active ingredients are released.  Used in this manner the HNTs are a delivery vector made of natural materials.

The largest supplier of commercial halloysite product available at present is located in Maturi Bay, New Zealand.  There is limited production in Poland, Turkey and China, and a development stage project in Utah with negligible commercial production.  The largest halloysite supplier in the ceramics industry sells halloysite at a price from $135 to $3,000 per ton.  The majority of imported halloysite in the United States for the ceramics industry is sold at a price of approximately $700 per ton.
 
Our halloysite is differentiated from those known halloysite deposits due to the high aspect ratio (the ratio of the length of the tube to the diameter of the tube) and by minimal levels of trace elements such as lead.  We are not targeting ceramic applications with our halloysite and instead focusing on the life science and plastic and polymer applications.  Third party research has indicated we have arguably the best halloysite for life science applications as the New Zealand deposit contains about 10% Cristobalite – a silica oxide that has been categorized as a carcinogen and the other deposits capable of meaningful commercial production have poorer aspect ratios and higher heavy metal / trace element content.
 
We are planning on producing two halloysite products.  The first branded HalloPureÒ will be about 70% halloysite and 30% kaolinite and will target the plastic and polymer and certain filtration applications.  The second is branded ULTRA HallopureÒ and will be in excess of 90% halloysite and less than 10% kaolinite.  Both are considered high value products.
 
To date we have received interest in our HNTs from a number of companies in a wide range of industries including: personal care products, nano-composites, fire retardants, biocides, plastic fillers, animal feed, paint, cosmetics, wound care treatment and ceramics.  Most of these companies have received samples of our products produced at recent pilot plants with some companies receiving up to 50 kg for bench scale product testing.  We have also provided samples free of charge to over twenty universities to help with the development of other new HNT applications.  Currently we have non-binding expressions of interest approximately equal to forecast production.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing.  Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than we do.  Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties.  In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties.  This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development.  This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.
Government Regulations
 
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We will obtain the licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration program. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in Idaho and the United States.
 
In Idaho, our exploration activities are regulated by the Idaho Department of Lands (“IDL”) pursuant to the Idaho Rules Governing Exploration Surface Mining and Closure of Cyanidation Facilities pursuant to the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act.  In order to carry out surface exploration and drilling activities, a company is required to file a Notification of Exploration with the IDL.  In 2000, we filed our original Notification of Exploration with the IDL, which has been subsequently amended, for our surface exploration and drilling programs on the Helmer-Bovill Property.
 
In order to carry out mining activities, we are required to obtain a Mine Plan for Operations (“MPO”) and Reclamation Plan (“ORP”).  In May 2017, we received an ORP for mining activities on the Bovill Project.  This ORP permits us to mine Bovill Kaolin for a period of 26 years.  In 2012, we received an ORP for the extraction of sand tailings on the WBL Tailings Project.  The ORP permits us to mine the sand tailings between May to October for a period of 10 years (2012 – 2022).

All leases are subject to rental fees of US$3.00 per acre each year increased annually by 3% and a production royalty of 5.0% based on gross proceeds. The production royalty is prepaid at US$2500.00 per lease per year. All lease prepayments are deductible against royalty payments in the event of commercial production.
 
Mining operations are also regulated by Mine and Safety Health Administration (“MSHA”). MSHA inspectors will periodically visit projects to monitor health and safety for the workers, and to inspect equipment and installations for code requirements. Although we are not engaged in mining operations, we require all of our workers to have completed safety training courses when working on our project.
 
Other regulatory requirements monitor the following:
 

(a) | Explosives and explosives handling. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Use and occupancy of site structures associated with mining. 
(c) | Hazardous materials and waste disposal. 
(d) | State Historic site preservation. 
(e) | Archaeological and paleontological finds associated with mining.

 
We believe that we are in compliance with all laws and plans to continue to comply with the laws in the future. We believe that compliance with the laws will not adversely affect its business operations. There is however no assurance that any change in government regulation in the future will not adversely affect our business operations.
 
Environmental Liability
 
We will have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental remediation for all exploration and development work undertaken. Both reclamation and environmental remediation refer to putting disturbed ground back as close to its original state as possible. Other potential pollution or damage must be cleaned up and renewed along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits. Reclamation is the process of bringing the land back to its natural state after completion of exploration activities. Environmental remediation refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage caused. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program that will be undertaken beyond completion of the recommended work program.
 
In the application for the Mine Plan of Operations and Reclamation Plan (“MPO”), costs are estimated for reclamation after 12 months of work, which would include construction, and for reclamation of the entire project and the IDL must agree to those costs.  Once the MPO is granted, I-Minerals must submit a surety or cash bond for the first 12 months to begin activities. After the first 12 months, the bond is increased to the full costs estimated to clean up the entire project.
 
Permits and regulations will control all aspects of the production program if the project continues to that stage. Examples of regulatory requirements include:
 

(i) | Water discharge will have to meet drinking water standards; 
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | Dust generation will have to be minimal or otherwise re-mediated; 
(iii) | Dumping of material on the surface will have to be re-contoured and re-vegetated with natural vegetation; 
(iv) | An assessment of all material to be left on the surface will need to be environmentally benign; 
(v) | Ground water will have to be monitored for any potential contaminants; 
(vi) | The socio-economic impact of the project will have to be evaluated and if deemed negative, will have to be re-mediated; and 
(vii) | There will have to be an impact report of the work on the local fauna and flora including a study of potentially endangered species.

 
A reclamation bond of US$7,600 has been posted to cover the current plan of operations for the WBL Tailings sand project. The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) has been publicly noted without objection as of November 16, 2012.  HDR Engineering, Inc. (HDR), under contract with I-Minerals, USA (I-Minerals), has updated this stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) to reflect the requirements in the 2021 Multi-Sector General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Industrial Activities (MSGP). I-Minerals has been operating this facility under the 2015 MSGP. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) re-issued the MSGP on January 15, 2021, with the 2021 MSGP becoming effective on March 1, 2021(replacing the 2015 MSGP). A notice of intent (NOI) and updated SWPPP was completed prior to May 30, 2021.  The Company does not view the current environmental liability to be material as of April 30, 2021 as the amount is estimated to be below $5,000.  Under our current ORP, we will be required to pay a reclamation bond of approximately $3,000,000 for the Bovill Project.
