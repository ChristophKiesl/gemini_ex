  Corporate History; Recent Events
  As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, the terms we, us, our, Bullfrog Gold and the Company refer to Bullfrog Gold Corp, a Delaware corporation.  Bullfrog Gold Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 23, 2007 as Kopr Resources Corp. On July 21, 2011, the Company changed its name to "Bullfrog Gold Corp.". The Company is in the exploration stage of its resource business.  Company Overview
 We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of properties that may contain gold and other mineralization primarily in the United States.  Bullfrog Project
 The Bullfrog Project lies approximately 4 miles west of the town of Beatty and 120 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. Standard Gold initially acquired in 2011 a 100% right, title and interest in 79 lode claims and 2 patented claims that contain approximately 1,600 acres subject to a 3% net smelter royalty.  On October 29, 2014, Rocky Mountain Minerals Corp. (RMM) a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Option Agreement (the Option) with Mojave. Mojave holds and possesses the purchase rights to 100% of 12 patented mining claims located in Nye County, Nevada. This property is contiguous to the Companys Bullfrog Project and covers approximately 156 acres, including the northeast half of the Montgomery-Shoshone (M-S) pit mined by Barrick Gold in the 1990s.  Mojave granted to RMM the sole and immediate working right and option with respect to the property until the 10th anniversary of the closing date, to earn a 100% interest in and to the property free and clear of all charges encumbrances and claims, save and except a sliding scale NSR Royalty.  In order to maintain in force the working right and Option granted to it, and to exercise the Option, RMM granted Mojave 750,000 shares of common stock and paid $16,000. RMM must pay to Mojave a total of $190,000 over the next 10 years. For reference, Barrick Bullfrog Inc. (Barrick) terminated a lease on these patents after they ceased operations in late 1999.  On March 23, 2015, RMM entered into a Mineral Lease and Option to Purchase Agreement with Barrick involving 6 patented mining claims, 20 unpatented mining claims, and 8 mill site claims located four miles west of Beatty, Nevada and covers approximately 444 acres. These properties are strategically located adjacent to the Companys Bullfrog Gold Project and include two patents that cover the southwest half of the M-S open pit from which Barrick produced approximately 220,000 ounces of gold by the late 1990s. Underground mining in the early 1900s produced approximately 70,000 ounces of gold from the M-S deposit. Also included in the agreement is the northern one third of the main Bullfrog deposit where Barrick mined approximately 2.1 million additional ounces by open pit and underground methods. In addition to prospective adjacent lands, these acquisitions provide the potential to expand the M-S deposit along strike and at depth and in the northern part of the main Bullfrog deposit.  The Company also has access to Barricks substantial data base within a 1.5 mile radius of the leased lands to further advance its exploration and development programs. To maintain the lease and option, the Company must spend $1.5 million dollars within five years on the Barrick properties and then pay Barrick 3.25 million shares of the Companys common stock while providing a 2% gross royalty on production from the Barrick properties. Overriding royalties of 5% net smelter returns and 5% gross proceeds are respectively limited to three claims and two patents in the main Bullfrog pit area. Barrick has retained a back-in right to reacquire a 51% interest in the Barrick properties, subject to definition of a mineral resource on the Barrick properties meeting certain criteria, and reimbursing the Company in an amount equal to two and one half times Company expenditures on the Barrick properties.   1    Significant drilling is required to test projections of mineralized trends and structures that extend for considerable distances to the north and east of the M-S pit on the original lands acquired by the Company in 2011. Located east of the M-S pit is an area 700 meters by 1,300 meters in which there is only one shallow hole from which there is no data available. Only a small portion of this area may be prospective, but the area certainly warrants additional study and exploration drilling.  There is only one drill hole located about 150 meters northeast of the M-S pit limit and another hole 1,000 meters northeast of the pit along strike of a major geologic structure. In this regard, the Companys lands extend nearly 5,000 meters north-northeast of the pit and there has been very little drilling in this area, even though several structures have been mapped by Barrick and others.  Barrick drilled twelve deep holes in the M-S area ranging from 318 meters to 549 meters. Notable mineral intercepts from four holes below the central part of the pit are summarized below:  
 | Intercept Data, Meters | Gold 
Hole No. | Thickness | Under Pit | g/t 
717 | 51.8 | 70 | 1.35
 | 18.3 | 135 | 0.59
 | 15.2 | 150 | 0.68
 | 160.0 | 180 | 0.96
732 | 10.7 | 200 | 0.84
 | 79.2 | 330 | 0.74
733 | 12.2 | 130 | 1.14
 | 13.7 | 220 | 0.75
 | 29.0 | 250 | 0.70
734 | 4.6 | 15 | 6.03
 | 21.3 | 70 | 1.43
 | 22.9 | 130 | 0.89
 | 4.6 | 190 | 1.04


These results demonstrate that substantial amounts of gold occur in an exceptionally large epithermal system that has good potential for expansion and possibly higher grades at depth. Three of these intercepts are less than 75 meters below the existing pit. Two holes located 40 meters and 90 meters east of the 160 meter interval in hole #717 contained no significant mineralization at this depth, whereas the 29 meters of mineral in hole #733 is 60 meters west and the mineral zone is open to the north, south and west.

For reference, Barrick terminated all mining and milling operations in the autumn of 1999 when their cash production costs exceeded gold prices that averaged less than $300 per ounce for the year and reached a low of $258/oz in August 1999. The economic margins for heap leaching lower grades at current gold prices near $1200/oz are deemed better than in 1999, and the Company is positioned to explore such opportunities. Furthermore, Barrick never controlled or had access to a patented claim on the immediate east and north limits of the M-S pit, but this patent is owned by the Company.

During the past year the Company has studied Barricks entire electronic data base and much of their paper data base obtained from their Elko, Nevada and Salt Lake City, Utah offices. On April 11, 2016 the Company distributed a press release that included a mineral inventory estimate of 470,000 ounces of gold, as summarized below.

Mineral Inventory Estimates


 | Tonnes | Gold | Gold 
Pit Areas | Millions | G/T | Ounces 
M-S Shallow | 1.1 | 1.06 | 38,612 
M-S Deeper | 0.9 | 0.93 | 26,813 
Bullfrog North | 13.3 | 0.88 | 375,051
BF NE Mystery Hill | 0.9 | 0.80 | 26,813 
Total/Average | 16.4 | 0.89 | 469,961

Based on cross sectional estimation methods using a nominal gold cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t. Average waste to mineral ratio was estimated at less than 5 to 1.

These estimates are supported by close-spaced drill holes upon which Barrick produced 2.3 million ounces of gold from proven and probable ore reserves during 1989 to 1999. As a result, it would not require much more drilling or expense to upgrade these inventories to much higher classifications and meet US and Canadian industry standards. For reference, the large electronic data base acquired from Barrick includes 253,900 meters or 157 miles of drilling in 1,298 holes and a paper data base that may weigh 2,000 pounds. In this regard, the Company is the only entity that examined the Bullfrog Project data base after it was re-located to Barricks Elko and Salt Lake City offices in 2000 and performed detailed evaluations of mineralization remaining around the M-S and Bullfrog mines. Notwithstanding, Barrick makes no representation concerning the accuracy, completeness or application of their data by the Company. It is further cautioned that the Bullfrog Project contains no reserves or resources and that the mineral inventory estimates and other forward looking statements herein may never become viable, feasible or economic.

The Company is in process of scanning Barricks paper drill hole data base that contains more than 157 miles of drilling in 1,311 holes and a complete set of assay certificates. This data will then be used to update the electronic data base for future mineral and resource estimation purposes.

Metallurgy

In 1994 Kappes Cassiday of Reno, NV performed simulated heap leach column tests on 250 kg samples with results as follows:


Size, inch | -1.5 | -3/8
Calc. Head, gold opt | .035 | .029
Rec., % | 71.4 | 75.9
Leach time, days | 41 | 41 


In 1995, Barrick performed a pilot heap leach test on 844 tons that were crushed to -½ inch and averaged 0.019 gold opt. In only 41 days of leaching, 67% of the gold was recovered while cyanide and lime consumptions were exceptionally low.

In 1986 St Joe column leached a 22-ton composite of minus 12-inch material grading 0.037 gold opt to simulate heap leaching material at a coarse run-of-mine (ROM) size and recovered 49% in 59 days of leaching, which they projected to 54% for leaching 90 days.

In summary, the Bullfrog Project mineralization has good heap leach gold recoveries for crushing to 1.5 inch or less and at ROM size. The latter is particularly important since much additional low grade under 0.3 g/t that must be excavated from a pit could be ROM heap leached to supplement production.

Competition
 We do not compete directly with anyone for the exploration or removal of minerals from our property as we hold all interest and rights to the claims. Readily available commodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for the sale of minerals. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell minerals that we are able to recover. We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as explosives or large equipment tires, and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators and services, such as contract drilling that we will need to conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment and services we need, we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States generally. We will also be subject to the regulations of the BLM with respect to mining claims on Federal lands.

Future exploration drilling on the Bullfrog Project on BLM lands will require a Plan of Operations approved by the BLM since the area is designated desert tortoise habitat.. A Plan of Operations can take several months to be approved, depending on the nature of the intended work, the level of reclamation bonding required, the need for archeological surveys, and other factors as may be determined by the BLM.

Research and Development
 As of the date of this filing we have had no expense related to research and development.

Employees
 As of the date of this filing, we employ 1 full-time employee, our Chief Executive Officer. We have had contracts with various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs, including investor relations, exploration, development, permitting, and other administrative functions, and may staff further with employees as we expand activities and bring new projects on line.
