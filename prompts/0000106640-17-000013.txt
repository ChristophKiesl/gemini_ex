ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Whirlpool Corporation ("Whirlpool"), the number one major appliance manufacturer in the world, was incorporated in 1955 under the laws of Delaware as the successor to a business that traces its origin to 1898. Whirlpool manufactures products in 14 countries and markets products in nearly every country around the world under brand names such as Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Consul, Brastemp, Amana, Bauknecht, Jenn-Air, Indesit, and Hotpoint*. Whirlpool’s reportable segments consist of North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), Latin America and Asia. As of December 31, 2016, Whirlpool had approximately 93,000 employees.
As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, “Whirlpool,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

In Asia, we have organized the marketing and distribution of our major home appliances and small domestic appliances into five operating groups: (1) mainland China; (2) Hong Kong and Taiwan; (3) India, which includes Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan; (4) Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islands; and (5) Southeast Asia, which includes Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Korea, Myanmar and Japan. We market and distribute our products in Asia primarily under the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Amana, Bauknecht, Jenn-Air, Diqua, and Royalstar brand names through a combination of direct sales to appliance retailers and chain stores and through full-service distributors to a large network of retail stores. 
Competition
Competition in the major home appliance industry is intense, including competitors such as Arcelik, Bosch Siemens, Electrolux, Haier, Kenmore, LG, Mabe, Midea, Panasonic and Samsung, many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint. Moreover, our customer base includes large, sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products, services and prices. Competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors, including selling price, product features and design, performance, innovation, energy efficiency, quality, cost, distribution and financial incentives. These financial incentives include cooperative advertising, co-marketing funds, salesperson incentives, volume rebates and terms. We believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products, building strong brands, enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings, expanding our regional footprint and trade distribution channels, increasing productivity, improving quality, lowering costs, and taking other efficiency-enhancing measures.
Raw Materials and Purchased Components
We are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business. In areas where a single supplier is used, alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment. Some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated. In the event of a disruption, we believe that we will be able to qualify and use alternate materials, sometimes at premium costs, and that such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules.
Trademarks, Licenses and Patents
We consider the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets we own, and the licenses we hold, in the aggregate, to be a valuable asset. Whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the United States and foreign countries. The most important trademarks to North America are Whirlpool, Maytag, Jenn-Air, KitchenAid, Amana and Acros. The most important trademarks to Latin America are Consul, Brastemp, Whirlpool and KitchenAid. The most important trademarks to EMEA are Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Bauknecht, Indesit, Hotpoint*, Hotpoint-Ariston and Ignis. The most important trademarks to Asia are Whirlpool, Royalstar and Diqua. We receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture, sell and service certain products bearing the Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, and Amana brand names. We continually apply for and obtain United States and foreign patents. The primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies.
Research and Development
Expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately $604 million, $579 million and $563 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Protection of the Environment
Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment, many of which require federal, state, or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges, air emissions, and hazardous waste management. Our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations. Where laws and regulations are less restrictive, we have established and are following our own standards, consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility.

We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position during 2016 and is not expected to be material in 2017.
The entire major home appliance industry, including Whirlpool, must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards. These standards were phased-in over the past several years and include the general phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals used in refrigeration, and energy standards for selected major appliances, regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives. Compliance with these various standards, as they become effective, will require some product redesign. However, we believe, based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations, that we will be able to develop, manufacture, and market products that comply with these regulations.
Whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally. These include operating and non-operating facilities, previously owned properties and waste sites, including "Superfund" (under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites. However, based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants, we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings, financial condition, or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters.
Acquisitions
Whirlpool China
On October 24, 2014, Whirlpool's wholly-owned subsidiary, Whirlpool (China) Investment Co., Ltd., completed its acquisition of a 51% equity stake in Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. ("Hefei Sanyo"), a joint stock company whose shares are listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which we have since renamed to Whirlpool (China) Co., Ltd. ("Whirlpool China"). The aggregate purchase price for the transaction was RMB 3.4 billion (approximately $551 million at the date of purchase for each step of the transaction) net of cash acquired.
Indesit Company S.p.A.
On December 3, 2014, Whirlpool completed the final step in its acquisition of Indesit Company S.p.A. ("Indesit") and on the same day Indesit delisted from the Electronic Stock Market organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. Total consideration paid for Indesit was €1.1 billion (approximately $1.4 billion at the dates of purchase of each step in the transaction) in aggregate net of cash acquired.
Further discussion of these transactions can be found in the Financial Condition and Liquidity section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.
