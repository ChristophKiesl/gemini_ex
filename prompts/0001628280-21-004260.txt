ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Ontrak, Inc. (“Ontrak,” “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 29, 2003. Ontrak was founded with a passion for engaging with and helping improve the health and save lives of anyone impacted by behavioral health conditions. We are a leading Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)-powered and telehealth-enabled, virtualized healthcare company, whose mission is to help improve the health and save the lives of as many people as possible. Our technology enabled platform, PRE™ (Predict-Recommend-Engage), organizes and automates healthcare data integration and analytics through the application of machine intelligence to deliver analytic insights. Our PRE platform predicts people whose chronic disease will improve with behavior change, recommends effective care pathways that people are willing to follow, and engages people who are not receiving the care they need. By combining predictive analytics with human engagement, we deliver improved member health and validated outcomes and savings to healthcare payors. 
Our technology-enabled Ontrak™ solutions, a critical component of the PRE platform, are designed to provide integrated healthcare solutions to members with behavioral conditions. We have a unique ability to engage these members, who do not otherwise seek behavioral healthcare, leveraging proprietary enrollment capabilities built on deep insights into the drivers of care avoidance. We integrate evidence-based psychosocial and medical interventions delivered either in-person or via telehealth, along with care coaching and in-market Community Care Coordinators who address the social and environmental determinants of health, including loneliness. As behavioral health conditions cause or exacerbate chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure, our programs seek to improve member health and deliver validated cost savings of more than 50% for enrolled members to healthcare payors. 
We operate as one segment in the United States and we have contracted with leading national and regional health plans to make the Ontrak program available to eligible members in 30 states and our nation's capital. 
Recent Developments
Corporate Name and Ticker Symbol Change
On July 6, 2020, we changed our corporate name from Catasys, Inc. to Ontrak, Inc. and changed our NASDAQ ticker symbol from CATS to OTRK effective July 7, 2020. We believe the change in our name leverages our national brand recognition of the Company's Ontrak solutions among our health plan members, health plan customers and network of behavioral health providers. 
Acquisition
On October 28, 2020, we completed the acquisition of LifeDojo Inc. (“LifeDojo”), a comprehensive, science-backed behavior change platform based in San Francisco, California. LifeDojo provides online behavior change and wellness programs, using a combination of coaching and mobile apps to help members form health habits and change health behaviors. This acquisition expands the total addressable market by enabling the creation of lower cost digital interventions across behavioral 
health and chronic disease populations. LifeDojo's member-facing apps also enhances our market leading behavioral engagement capabilities. 
Customer Notification
On February 26, 2021, we were notified by our largest customer that the participation status with this customer will be terminated effective June 26, 2021. We have been advised to stop enrollment of new members for this customer and await guidance from the customer on transition plans for the 8,100 members who are currently benefiting from the Ontrak program. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this customer accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenue.
Our Market
The true impact of behavioral health is often under-identified by organizations that provide healthcare benefits. Individuals with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that worsen chronic medical comorbidities cost health plans and employers a disproportionate amount of the total healthcare costs.
A smaller, high-cost subset of these patients with behavioral health conditions drives the majority of the claims costs for the overall substance dependent population. According to Milliman's research report titled "How do individuals with behavioral health conditions contribute to physical and total healthcare spending?" dated August 13, 2020, the behavioral subgroup patients constituted 5.7% of the total commercial population of insured lives but accounted for 44% of total commercial healthcare costs. Furthermore, it was noted in McKinsey and Co.'s article titled "A holistic approach for the U.S. behavioral health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic," dated August 6, 2020, that in the post-COVID-19 period, traumatic stress, unemployment, and social isolation will lead to exacerbation of existing behavioral health conditions and onset of new conditions that could drive $100 billion to $140 billion of additional spending on behavioral and physical health services in 2020 and 2021. 
The National Institute of Mental Health reports that nearly one in five adults in the United States of America are impacted by one of the following behavioral health issues:
•Substance abuse. Scientific research indicates that not only can drugs interfere with normal brain functioning, but they can also have long-lasting effects that persist even after the drug is no longer being used. Data indicates that at some point, changes may occur in the brain that can turn drug and alcohol abuse into substance dependence—a chronic, relapsing, and sometimes fatal disease. Those dependent on drugs may suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and be unable to stop drug use or remain drug abstinent without effective treatment. Professional medical treatment may be necessary to end this physiologically-based compulsive behavior.
•Anxiety Disorders. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting an estimated 19.1% of adults aged 18 years or older. 
•Depression. In 2017, an estimated 17.3 million U.S. adults aged 18 or older, or approximately 7.1% of all U.S. adults, had at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Patients with substance dependence and mood disorders were ranked four out of the top 10 reasons leading to readmission rates for Medicaid patients.
When considering behavioral health-related costs, many organizations have historically only looked at direct treatment costs–usually behavioral claims. For the members we seek to engage our solution, costs associated with behavioral health treatment represent a small portion of their overall healthcare claims, while the medical costs are significant, as most patients with behavioral health conditions do not receive the appropriate treatment they need for other existing medical conditions.
Our Solution
Our Ontrak technology enabled solution includes identification, engagement and treatment of health plan members with unaddressed behavioral health conditions. We specifically focus on members with anxiety, depression and/or substance use disorder(s) by applying claims-based analytics and predictive modeling to first identify health plan members with medical costs that may be impacted through behavioral health treatment with the Ontrak program. These members may or may not be diagnosed with a behavioral condition. We then conduct multichannel outreach to engage and enroll these members. Enrolled members receive care coaching and the opportunity to participate in telehealth or face-to-face evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological treatment from our proprietary network of third-party providers. We believe the benefits of Ontrak include improved clinical outcomes and decreased costs for the payor, as well as improved quality of life for the member. We provide outcomes reporting to payors on a periodic basis to demonstrate the value of the program. 
Our business strategy is to deliver proven, repeatable clinical and financial outcomes to health plans for their members with unaddressed behavioral conditions that worsen medical comorbidities. We do this by identifying, engaging and treating these members through our Ontrak solution. Our Ontrak solution to date has focused on substance use disorder, anxiety and depression.
Our Ontrak solution combines care coaching, innovative psychosocial and medical treatment delivered through a proprietary provider network and in-market support from Community Care Coordinators. The solution is designed to help payors treat and manage populations struggling with substance use disorder, depression and anxiety to improve their health and thereby decrease their overall health care costs.
We are currently marketing our Ontrak solution to payors on a case rate, monthly fee, or fee for service basis, which involves educating them on the disproportionately high cost of their population with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that exacerbate medical comorbidities, and demonstrating the potential for Ontrak to reduce these costs.
Regulatory Matters
The healthcare industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo significant changes. Healthcare companies are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws, regulations and judicial decisions. For more information about regulatory matters, see discussion under "Risks related to our healthcare industry" in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources 
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to the continued success of our business. We are focused on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals across all areas of our business and committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. All of our employees are required to adhere to a professional code of conduct and comply with annual training on, but not limited to, raising awareness, preventing and reporting any type of unlawful discrimination. We are not a party to any labor agreements and none of our employees are represented by a labor union.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 726 employees, which included 723 full-time, one part-time and two temporary employees, and represents an 84% year-over-year increase in our total employee headcount. A majority of our employee base is comprised of care coaches, member engagement specialists and other staff directly involved in member care, as well as research and development, engineering and administrative team members. We expect our headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to make investments to support the growth of our business. 
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had a total of approximately 40 independent contractors who provide us various consulting services, including recruiting, health network providers, marketing and other professional services, that are important to the operation of our business.
