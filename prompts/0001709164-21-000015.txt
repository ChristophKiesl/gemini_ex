Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (“Hamilton Beach Holding” or the “Company”) is a holding company and operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. (“HBB”). HBB is the Company's single reportable segment.
The only material assets held by Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company are its investments in its consolidated subsidiaries. Substantially all of its cash flows are provided by dividends paid or distributions made by its subsidiaries. Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company has not guaranteed any obligations of its subsidiaries.
The Company also previously operated through its former wholly-owned subsidiary, The Kitchen Collection, LLC ("KC"), which is reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented herein. KC completed its dissolution on April 3, 2020 with a pro-rata distribution of its remaining assets to creditors, at which time the KC legal entity ceased to exist. 
HBB is a leading designer, marketer, and distributor of a wide range of branded, small electric household and specialty housewares appliances, as well as commercial products for restaurants, fast food chains, bars, and hotels. HBB operates in the consumer, commercial and specialty small appliance markets.
On September 29, 2017, NACCO Industries, Inc. ("NACCO"), Hamilton Beach Holding's former parent company, spun-off the Company to NACCO stockholders. In the spin-off, NACCO stockholders, in addition to retaining their shares of NACCO common stock, received one share of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company Class A common stock ("Class A Common") and one share of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company Class B common stock ("Class B Common") for each share of NACCO Class A or Class B common stock. In accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance, the Company accounted for the spin-off from NACCO based on the historical carrying value of assets and liabilities. As a result of the distribution of one share of Class A Common and one share of Class B Common for each share of NACCO Class A or NACCO Class B common stock, the earnings per share amounts for the Company for periods prior to the spin-off have been calculated based upon the number of shares distributed in the spin-off. NACCO did not receive any proceeds from the spin-off.
The Company makes its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports available, free of charge, through its website, www.hamiltonbeachbrands.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Sales and Marketing
HBB designs, markets and distributes a wide range of branded, small electric household and specialty housewares appliances, including, but not limited to, air fryers, blenders, coffee makers, food processors, indoor electric grills, irons, juicers, mixers, slow cookers, toasters and toaster ovens. HBB also designs, markets and distributes commercial products for restaurants, fast food chains, bars and hotels. HBB generally markets its “good” and “better” consumer products under the Hamilton Beach® and Proctor Silex® brands. HBB participates in the premium market with its owned brands Hamilton Beach® Professional and Weston® farm-to-table and field-to-table food processing equipment. Additionally, the Company participates in the premium market through multiyear licensing agreements to market and distribute a line of countertop appliances under the Wolf Gourmet® brand, a line of premium garment care products under the CHI® brand, and the Bartesian® premium cocktail delivery system. The Company also sells TrueAir® air purifiers and BrightlineTM brand personal care products. HBB markets its commercial products under the Hamilton Beach Commercial® and the Proctor Silex Commercial® brands. HBB supplies private label products on a limited basis. HBB also licenses certain of its trademarks to various licensees in categories such as microwave ovens, among others. 
Sales promotion activities are supported through print and digital marketing vehicles. HBB promotes certain of its innovative products through the use of television, internet and print advertising.
Customers
Sales in North America are generated predominantly by a network of inside sales employees to mass merchandisers, ecommerce retailers, national department stores, variety store chains, drug store chains, specialty home retailers, distributors, restaurants, bars, hotels and other retail outlets. Walmart Inc. and its global subsidiaries accounted for approximately 35%, 33% and 33% of the HBB’s revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 16%, 14% and 10% of the HBB's revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. HBB’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 64%, 58%, and 53% of HBB’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Product Warranty
HBB's warranty program to the consumer consists generally of an assurance-type limited warranty lasting for varying periods of up to ten years for electric appliances, with the majority of products having a warranty of one to three years. There is no guarantee to the consumer as HBB may repair or replace, at its option, those products returned under warranty.
Working Capital
The market for small electric household and specialty housewares appliances is highly seasonal in nature. The majority of HBB's revenue and operating profit typically occurs in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday-selling season. Due to the seasonality of purchases of its products, HBB generally uses a substantial amount of cash or short-term debt to finance inventory in anticipation of the fall holiday-selling season.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
HBB holds patents and trademarks registered in the United States ("U.S.") and foreign countries for various products. HBB believes its business is not dependent upon any individual patent, copyright or license, but that the Hamilton Beach®, Proctor Silex®, Hamilton Beach® Professional, and Weston® trademarks are material to its business.
Product Design and Development
HBB incurred $10.0 million, $12.1 million and $11.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on product design and development activities.
Key Suppliers and Raw Material
HBB’s products are supplied to its specifications by third-party suppliers. HBB does not maintain long-term purchase contracts with suppliers and operates mainly on a purchase order basis. HBB generally negotiates the purchases from its foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars.
During 2020, HBB purchased substantially all of its finished products from suppliers in China. HBB purchases its inventory from approximately 63 suppliers, one of which represented more than 10% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2020. HBB believes the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on its business because there are adequate supplier choices available that can meet HBB’s production and quality requirements. However, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect HBB’s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured.
The principal raw materials used by HBB’s third-party suppliers to manufacture its products are plastic, glass, steel, copper, aluminum and packaging materials. HBB believes adequate quantities of raw materials are available from various suppliers.
Competition
HBB believes the principal areas of competition with respect to its products are product design and innovation, quality, price, product features, supply chain excellence, merchandising, promotion and warranty. HBB competes with many manufacturers and distributors of housewares products. As brick and mortar retailers generally purchase a limited selection of branded, small electric appliances, HBB competes with other suppliers for retail shelf space. In the ecommerce channel, HBB must compete with a broad list of competitors for brand reputation through strong ratings and reviews from consumers.
To meet these competitive challenges, the Company has focused on continued innovation in its leading brands as well as expanding into new categories using existing core competencies. HBB’s presence in a significant number of product categories across various price points allows the Company to meet the needs of a wide range of retailers and consumers. Based on publicly available information about the industry, HBB believes it is one of the largest full-line distributors and marketers of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances in North America, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, based on key product categories. Hamilton Beach® is the #1 small kitchen appliance brand in the US, in brick-and-mortar and ecommerce channels, based on units sold. 
To a lesser degree, HBB retail product lines compete outside of North America. HBB's commercial products compete globally. The competition in these geographic markets is fragmented and HBB is not yet a significant participant although our commercial business has generated a stronger position in these markets.
Government Regulation
HBB is subject to numerous federal and state health, safety and environmental regulations. HBB believes the impact of expenditures to comply with such laws will not have a material adverse effect on HBB.
As a marketer and distributor of consumer products, HBB is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which empower the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to seek to exclude products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous from the market. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require HBB to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of HBB’s products, or HBB may voluntarily do so.
Throughout the world, electrical appliances are subject to various mandatory and voluntary standards, including requirements in some jurisdictions that products be listed by Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”) or other similar recognized laboratories. HBB also uses Intertek Testing Services for certification and testing of compliance with UL standards, as well as other national and industry specific standards. HBB endeavors to have its products designed to meet the certification requirements of, and to be certified in, each of the jurisdictions in which they are sold.
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires public companies to disclose whether certain minerals, commonly known as "conflict minerals," are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by those companies and if those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country. HBB conducts supply-chain due diligence investigations required by the conflict minerals rules and makes disclosures required by the Dodd Frank Act. Our compliance with these investigation and disclosure requirements could adversely affect our ability to sell products to customers that HBB is unable to designate as "DRC conflict free."

Human Capital Management 
The Company’s success is a result of its organizational culture built on and centered around Good Thinking which incorporates teamwork and inspired thinking into all areas of our business. The Company employed approximately 700 individuals, as of December 31, 2020, in four countries—Canada, China, Mexico, and the United States. There are approximately 500 employees in the United States with about half of this group based at the Company’s headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, which is home to the Company’s product design, development and marketing teams (led by long-tenured Company leaders) and its state-of-the-art test kitchen. We pride ourselves on attracting and retaining highly dedicated and customer-focused employees at all levels of the organization. As an example, our engineering department, which focuses on continued innovation and development, has on average 12 years of experience with the Company.
We believe that our Good Thinking values-based culture is a core strength that provides the foundation for our employees. Our business is about people– our employees, our customers who enjoy our appliances, and the communities in which we live. In 2020, we adopted a parental leave policy that provides four weeks of paid leave. In response to COVID-19, we enacted swift measures to provide safe environments for our employees world-wide by implementing recommended safety protocols at all of our locations. We also provided periods of time-off, time-away, and other increased flexibility (above and beyond federal and state mandates) for our employees. Then, in a joint effort with our employees at our corporate headquarters, we increased our donations in 2020 to a local foodbank that provides meals and other support to families in need. We recognize that the strength of our relationships with our employees, customers, and other stakeholders directly contributes to our long-term success and, in 2021, will continue internal assessment of opportunities to implement corporate social responsibility initiatives.
