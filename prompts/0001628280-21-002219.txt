Item 1. Business
Business Overview
ON Semiconductor Corporation, together with its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries ("ON Semiconductor," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company"), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1992 under the name Motorola Energy Systems, Inc. Immediately prior to our August 4, 1999 recapitalization, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola. 
ON Semiconductor is driving innovation in energy-efficient electronics. We believe that our extensive portfolio of sensors, power management, connectivity, custom and SoC, analog, logic, timing and discrete devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in advanced electronic systems and products. Our power management and motor driver semiconductor components control, convert, protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices. Our custom ASICs and SoC devices use analog, MCU, DSP, mixed-signal and advanced logic capabilities to enable the application and uses of many of our automotive, medical, aerospace/defense, consumer and industrial customers’ products. Our signal management semiconductor components provide high-performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing, communications and industrial systems. Our portfolio of sensors, including image sensors, radar and LiDAR, provide advanced solutions for automotive, industrial and IoT applications. Our high performance Wi-Fi solution creates a strong platform for addressing connectivity solutions for industrial IoT applications. Our standard semiconductor components serve as "building blocks" within virtually all types of electronic devices. 
As of December 31, 2020, we were organized into the following three operating and reportable segments: the Power Solutions Group ("PSG"), the Advanced Solutions Group ("ASG") and the Intelligent Sensing Group ("ISG").
Recent Business Strategy Developments
Our primary focus is on gross margin expansion, while at the same time, achieving significant revenue growth in our focused end-markets of automotive, industrial and communication infrastructure as well as being opportunistic in other end-markets.
In light of these objectives, we have begun the process of evaluating our current product portfolio. We intend to allocate capital and research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in high-margin products and end-markets by moving away from non-differentiated products, which have had historically lower gross margins, and in that process, reduce complexity, streamline the organization, and improve operating efficiencies.
Additionally, we believe these actions will allow us to transition to a lighter internal fabrication model where our gross margins will be less volatile and not as heavily influenced by our internal manufacturing volumes. As further discussed below, we are also rationalizing our manufacturing footprint to align with our investment priorities and corporate strategy. Our goal is to reduce volatility in our gross margins and maximize return on our manufacturing investments with the intent to have our product strategy drive our manufacturing footprint and capital investments. 
Novel coronavirus disease 2019 ("COVID-19")
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world. Our results of operations were adversely impacted during the majority of 2020 due to the reduced demand from our customers, government-mandated temporary shutdowns of certain of our facilities, supply shortages and other logistical constraints arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on us due to a number of uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, globally and, in particular, in the markets in which we do business, the impact of the pandemic on our customers' businesses, the imposition of any future government restrictions on staffing and facility operations, supply chain shortages, and other disruptions. Without global containment, it is likely that the pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future.
Pending and completed acquisitions 
On April 22, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. ("GFUS") and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. pursuant to which we will acquire GFUS’s East 
Fishkill, New York site and fabrication facilities and certain other assets and liabilities on or around December 31, 2022 (the "Closing Date"), subject to certain conditions, for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million in cash, subject to adjustment as described in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Total Consideration"). On April 22, 2019, we paid GFUS $70.0 million of the Total Consideration in cash as a non-refundable deposit, which will be applied toward and reduce the Total Consideration. 
On October 1, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "APA Amendment") pursuant to which we paid GFUS a non-refundable deposit in the amount of $100.0 million in cash on October 5, 2020 (the "Additional Deposit"). The Additional Deposit will be applied toward and reduce the Total Consideration as a non-refundable deposit, and the remaining $230.0 million of the Total Consideration will be paid on or around the Closing Date. Other terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement remain unchanged.
With the expected completion of the acquisition in East Fishkill, New York on or around December 31, 2022, we initiated structural changes to our manufacturing footprint. During February and August 2020, we announced that we were exploring the sales of our six-inch fabrication facilities in Oudenaarde, Belgium and Niigata, Japan, respectively. We could incur accounting charges in the future in connection with the active marketing and sale of these fabrication facilities and for costs to transition the manufacturing activity to other sites in our manufacturing network.
On June 19, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Quantenna Communications, Inc. ("Quantenna"). Following the acquisition, Quantenna changed its name to ON Semiconductor Connectivity Solutions, Inc. The purchase price totaled $1,039.3 million, and was funded with the proceeds from a $900.0 million draw against our Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand. We believe the acquisition of Quantenna creates a strong platform for addressing connectivity solutions for industrial IoT by combining our expertise in power management and bluetooth technologies with Quantenna's Wi-Fi technologies and software capabilities.
See Note 5: ''Acquisitions, Divestiture and Licensing Transactions'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Revenue-Generating Activities
ON Semiconductor generates revenue from the sale of our semiconductor products to distributors, OEMs and electronic manufacturing service providers. We also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. Our devices are found in a wide variety of end products as noted within the sample applications in the end-markets section below. Our portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced ICs and the "building block" components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions. We offer micro packages, which provide increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today's ever shrinking electronic devices and power modules, delivering improved energy efficiency and reliability for a wide variety of medium and high power applications. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, combined with our applications and global manufacturing and logistics network, provides our customers with single source purchasing on a cost-effective and timely basis.
We shipped approximately 64.3 billion units in 2020 and approximately 66.2 billion units in 2019, resulting in a period-over-period decrease of approximately 3%. As many of our products are sold into different end-markets, the total revenue reported under PSG, ASG and ISG is not indicative of actual sales in the end-market associated with that segment, but rather is the sum of the revenue from the product lines assigned to that segment. From time to time, we reassess the alignment of our product families and devices to our operating segments and may move product families or individual devices from one operating segment to another.
The following table illustrates the product technologies under each of our segments based on our operating strategy: 

PSG | ASG | ISG 
Analog products | Analog products | LSI products
Discrete products | ASIC products | Sensors 
MOSFET Products | Connectivity products | 
Power Module products | ECL products | 
Isolation products | Foundry products / services | 
Memory products | Gate Driver products |

Customers
We sell our products to distributors, OEMs and electronic manufacturing service providers for ultimate use in a variety of end-products in different end-markets. In general, we have maintained long-term relationships with our key customers. Sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply, but generally do not require minimum purchase commitments. Our distributors generally negotiate pricing terms on a quarterly basis, most of our OEM customers negotiate pricing terms on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year and electronic manufacturing service providers negotiate prices periodically during the year. Pricing terms on product development agreements are negotiated at the beginning of a project. With respect to customers in public sector, the government’s remedies may include suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, almost 
all of our contracts have default provisions, and certain of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency.
We generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Our standard warranty extends for a period of two years from the date of delivery, except in the case of image sensor products, which are warrantied for one year from the date of delivery. Our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and, generally prior to start of production for custom products without incurring a penalty. For the year ended December 31, 2020, aggregate revenue from our five largest customers for PSG, ASG and ISG, comprised approximately 46%, 36% and 43%, respectively, of the respective segment revenue. The loss of certain of these customers may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment and our consolidated results of operations.
Distributors
Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 60% of our revenue in 2020, 57% of our revenue in 2019 and 60% of our revenue in 2018. We had one distributor whose revenue accounted for approximately 11% of the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our distributors resell to mid-sized and smaller OEMs and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies. Sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. 
OEMs
Sales to OEMs accounted for approximately 34% of our revenue in 2020, 36% of our revenue in 2019 and 34% of our revenue in 2018. OEM customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry. We focus on three types of OEMs: multi-nationals; selected regional accounts; and target market customers. Large multi-nationals and selected regional accounts, which are significant in specific markets, are our core OEM customers. The target market customers for our end-markets are OEMs that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development. Generally, our OEM customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our warranty.
Electronic Manufacturing Service Providers
Sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 6% of our revenue in 2020, 7% of our revenue in 2019 and 6% of our revenue in 2018. These customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for OEMs. Many OEMs outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies. Generally, our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our warranty.
For additional information regarding agreements with our customers, see "Markets," "Resources" and "Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and Note 2: "Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Competition

We face significant competition from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because some of our components are often building block semiconductors that, in some cases, can be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully-customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See "Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.
In comparison, several of our competitors are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments:
PSG 

Our competitive strengths include our core competencies of leading edge fabrication technologies, micro packaging expertise, breadth of product line and IP portfolio, high quality cost effective manufacturing and supply chain management which ensures supply to our customers. Our commitment to continual innovation allows us to provide an ever broader range of semiconductor solutions to our customers who differentiate in power density and power efficiency, the key performance characteristics driving our markets.
The principal methods of competition in our discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products are through new products and package innovations enabling enhanced performance over existing products. Of particular importance are our power MOSFETs, IGBTs, WBG MOSFETs and diodes, including SiC and GaN rectifiers and power module portfolio for power conversion applications, and ESD portfolio for hi-speed serial interface protection products, where we believe we have significant performance advantages over our competition. PSG's competitors include: Broadcom Limited ("Broadcom"), Diodes Incorporated, Infineon Technologies AG ("Infineon"), KEC Corporation, Nexperia BV, Rohm Semiconductor USA LLC ("Rohm"), Semtech Corporation, STMicroelectronics N.V. ("STMicroelectronics"), Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI"), Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba") and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.
ASG

ASG principally competes on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel. Our competitive position with respect to the above basis is enhanced by long-standing relationships with leading OEM customers.
Our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and availability of supply, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. Competitors for certain of ASG's products and solutions include: Infineon, NXP Semiconductors N.V. ("NXP"), STMicroelectronics and TI.
ISG
ISG differentiates itself from the competition through deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive leading edge sensing performance for both human and machine vision applications. ISG has significant imaging experience and was one of the earliest to commercialize CMOS active pixel sensors and introduce CMOS technology in many of our markets. ISG has leveraged this expertise into market leading positions in automotive and industrial applications, which allows us to offer technical and end-user applications knowledge to help customers develop innovative sensing solutions across a broad range of end-user needs. 
Competitors for certain of ISG's products and solutions include: Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation ("Sony Semiconductor"), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Samsung"), Omnivision, STMicroelectronics and Toshiba for image sensors; Rohm, Renesas Electronics Corporation and Dongwoon Anatech Co., Ltd. for actuator drivers; TI, NXP, and Infineon for radar; and Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Broadcom and ST Microelectronics for SiPMs and SPADs.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
As of December 31, 2020, our sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1,700 professionals servicing customers globally. We support our customers through just-in-time warehouses. We have global distribution centers in China, the Philippines and Singapore. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers' needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective global applications support from our technical information centers and solution engineering centers, allowing for applications that are developed in one region of the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions.
Backlog
Our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our EDI customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13-week period following such date. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. During 2020, our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 85% and 97% of actual revenue during such quarter, which is slightly higher than the backlog levels in recent prior periods. As manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases, customers tend to order products further in advance and, as a result, backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenue during such period is likely to increase.

In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or, as a matter of industry practice, are often not enforced. Therefore, a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancellable. For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results.
We sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products. However, these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price re-negotiations. We routinely generate inventory based on customers' estimates of end-user demand for their products, which are difficult to predict. See "Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" located elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the inventory practices within the semiconductor industry.
Resources
Raw Materials
Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, SiC wafers, laminate substrates, gold, copper, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases as well as other production supplies used in our manufacturing processes. We obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources, generally on a just-in-time basis, and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our contractual obligations table in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand in the industry or other factors.
Manufacturing and Design Operations
We currently have domestic design operations in Arizona, California, Idaho, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah and Virginia. We also have foreign design operations in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. 
We operate front-end wafer fabrication facilities in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the United States and back-end assembly and test site facilities in Canada, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to these front-end and back-end manufacturing operations, our facility in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Czech Republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities.

(3)These facilities are located on leased land. 
(4)In February and August 2020, we announced that we are exploring the sales of the front-end manufacturing facilities in Oudenaarde, Belgium and Niigata, Japan, respectively.
See Note 5: ''Acquisitions, Divestiture and Licensing Transactions'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K regarding the pending acquisition of a manufacturing facility in 2022. 
We operate all of our existing manufacturing facilities directly except our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited, a joint venture company in which we own 80% of the outstanding equity interests ("Leshan"). The financial and operating results of Leshan have been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner in Leshan, Leshan Radio Company Ltd. ("Leshan Radio"), is formerly a state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement between us and Leshan Radio, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment, provided that any shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We committed to purchase 80% of Leshan's production capacity in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80% of Leshan's expected production capacity in 2021.
On April 1, 2020, we acquired the remaining 40% of the equity interest in ON Semiconductor Aizu Co. Ltd., ("OSA") from Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited ("FSL"), whereby OSA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The 
manufacturing facility located in Aizuwakamatsu, Japan is owned by OSA. The purchase price payable to FSL for the remaining 40% equity, offset by the purchase price adjustment, resulted in us receiving $26.0 million in settlement of the purchase price from FSL. The results of OSA have been consolidated in our financial statements since the fourth quarter of 2018, when we acquired the majority equity interest.
We use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These contract manufacturers collectively accounted for approximately 33% of our total manufacturing input costs in 2020, 31% in 2019 and 36% in 2018.
For information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see "Risk Factors —Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights

We market our products primarily under our registered trademark ON Semiconductor® and our ON logo, and, in the United States and internationally, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our IP. We acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisitions, and we have numerous U.S. and foreign patents issued, allowed and pending. As of December 31, 2020, we held patents with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2040, and none of the patents that expire in the next three years materially affect our business. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. 
Seasonality
We believe our business today is driven more by content gains within applications and secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality, as was the case historically. As we did in 2020, we could again experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or macroeconomic conditions. Although the significant fluctuation experienced during 2020 was mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to employ measures to lower the impact of general industry cyclicality on our results by focusing on product diversification and content gains. For information regarding risks associated with the cyclicality and seasonality of our business, see "Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of contamination. As with other companies engaged in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, with respect to such matters, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines.
We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable environmental regulations for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not material, and we do not expect the cost of complying with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, together with any liabilities for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures or earnings of ours or our subsidiaries' competitive position. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. See Note 13: ''Commitments and Contingencies'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information on certain environmental matters.
We are also subject to numerous United States and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, tariffs, trade sanctions, trade barriers, trade embargoes, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act ("ITAR"), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Additionally, U.S. or China 
governmental authorities have taken, and may continue to take, administrative, legislative or regulatory action that could impact our operations.
We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable trade regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, ITAR, FCPA, the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act, and similar applicable laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable trade regulations for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not material, and we do not expect the cost of complying with existing trade laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, or earnings of ours or our subsidiaries' competitive position. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations or government policies, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. For information regarding risks associated with import-export control regulations and similar applicable laws and regulations, see "Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources
Core Principles
Our success depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate our employees, particularly highly-skilled engineers involved in the design, development, manufacture and support of new and existing products and services. We are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"). The principles of the RBA are fundamental to our corporate culture and core values and are reflected in our commitments to our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders. These principles include providing a safe and positive work environment to our employees that emphasizes learning and professional development and respect for individuals and ethical conduct.
Headcount
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 31,000 regular full-time employees and approximately 3,500 part-time and temporary employees in facilities located in 34 countries. Approximately 13% of our regular full-time employees are located in the United States and Canada, 13% in Europe and Middle Eastern countries and 74% in Asia Pacific and Japan, with approximately 68% engaged in manufacturing, 3% directly in research and development, 6% in customer service or other aspects of sales and marketing, and 23% in other roles. Approximately 111 of our domestic employees (or approximately 3% of our U.S. based employees) are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. All of these employees are located at our Mountain Top, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. Certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements (e.g., those in China, Vietnam, Japan, the Czech Republic and Belgium) or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are consciously expanding the diversity of our workforce, creating growth and development opportunities for our employees, embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive work environment. We have organization level and overall Company metrics to monitor for diverse directors and above, diverse new hires and diverse promotions. Our Human Resources organization and the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors"), through its charter, provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workflow equity and workplace inclusion. 
Compensation, Benefits, Health, Safety and Wellness
Our compensation philosophy is focused on delivering total rewards based on corporate affordability in a way that enables attraction, retention, and recognition of performance delivered in an equitable manner. We provide our employees and their families with access to flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that secure them during events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being. Our primary focus during the COVID-19 pandemic has been protecting the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented appropriate changes in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate, all in compliance with applicable law. We use a combination of total rewards and other programs (which vary by region and salary grade) to attract and retain our employees, including: annual performance bonuses; stock awards, including an employee stock purchase plan; retirement support; healthcare and insurance benefits; business travel and disability insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts; flexible work schedules, vacation and paid time off; parental leave; paid counseling assistance; backup child and adult care; education assistance; and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers.
Career Growth and Development
We invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee motivation, performance and improving retention. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We have established a leadership pathway model as a tool for employees to practice and apply learning as part of their development.
Turnover
Our voluntary employee turnover rate in 2020 was approximately 9.1%, which rate includes the employees who exited pursuant to the Voluntary Separation Program ("VSP") offered during the year. We monitor employee turnover rates by region and the Company as a whole. The average tenure of our employees is approximately seven years and approximately one-fifth of our employees have been employed by us for more than 10 years. We believe our compensation philosophy along with the career growth and development opportunities promotes longer employee tenure and reduces voluntary turnover.
