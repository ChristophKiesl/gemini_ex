Automotive suppliers must meet critical industry standards such as the Materials Management Operations Guideline/Logistics Evaluation (MMOG/LE) and International Automotive Task Force (IATF) 16949:2016 (previously ISO/TS 16949). Disruptions to the supply chain can cause significant financial impact. QAD’s automotive-specific processes and built-in industry best practices help automotive suppliers reduce costs, mitigate supply chain risk and improve supply chain planning and visibility. Our customer base includes companies serving the global automotive marketplace and we focus on two sectors: tier 1 suppliers and the automotive aftermarket. We deliver unique capabilities to support the collaboration requirements of automotive suppliers, including the strict quality requirements of Advanced Product Quality Process (APQP) and Production Part Approval Process (PPAP). Many of our customers use QAD Cloud EDI because it provides a scalable solution which standardizes Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) across their global enterprise. QAD Supplier Portal, which allows for electronic communication with other suppliers, is another product commonly used by our automotive customers. QAD solutions are in use at many of the market-leading automotive parts companies throughout the world that manufacture a broad range of components used in interiors, electrical components, safety systems, bodies and drivetrains.  
Life Sciences: Life sciences manufacturers are dedicated to innovation, product quality and patient safety; however, a tightening regulatory environment, increasing cost pressures and greater supply chain complexities present challenges to the industry. Emerging markets, quality initiatives, and mergers and acquisitions activity also add to the complexity of life sciences manufacturing and distribution. QAD focuses on the following four sectors in the life sciences industry: diagnostic devices; contract manufacturing; medical devices; and pharmaceutical/biotechnology manufacturers. QAD solutions help global life sciences companies manufacture products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations and standards like ISO13485:2016 that are required by regulators around the world. In addition to cGMP, QAD solutions support many business and regulatory processes specific to the life sciences industry, such as automated quality management, supply chain planning and serialization in support of requirements for Unique Device Identification (UDI), the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) and the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD). QAD Adaptive ERP for life sciences provides our customers with a qualified IT infrastructure as a key building block to help them ensure that they have a solid foundation for addressing life sciences regulatory requirements.
Consumer Products: Manufacturers of consumer products have the objective of delivering the right product, in the right quantities, to the right location at the right time to satisfy demand. To meet this goal, effective supply chain management is needed to synchronize critical activities and functions across the organization.  To gain market share and improve profitability, consumer products companies must anticipate and meet customer demand while managing their margins and complying with evolving safety and environmental regulations. QAD focuses on the following four sectors in the consumer products industry: household and personal packaged products; consumer electronics; assembled and discrete products; and jewelry manufacturing. The manufacturing processes for these items vary and depend on the nature of the item; however, the fulfillment and distribution requirements have significant commonality. Major retailers manage complex supply chains and are typically very demanding of their suppliers as they strive to service growing demand from consumers for speed of delivery and variety of products. QAD solutions address the complex replenishment requirements of companies supplying the retail supply chain, including promotional pricing, demand planning, quality compliance and product configuration.
Food and Beverage: Food and beverage manufacturing is complex and requires regular updates to product, packaging and pricing. There is a lack of uniformity in the supply chain, which challenges food and beverage manufacturers to excel at supply chain management, as seasonal demand changes cause inefficiencies and increase manufacturing costs. At the same time, manufacturers must comply with requirements like field to fork traceability and record keeping. QAD focuses on the following five sectors in the food and beverage industry: fresh foods; frozen foods; candy and confections; bottling and canning; and sprits, wine and beer. Our solutions support regulatory and quality initiatives, such as the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) analysis, which address the management of biological, chemical and physical hazards. Our solutions support the product cycle of the food and beverage industry from raw material production, procurement and handling to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product.
High Technology: The success of manufacturers in the high technology industry relies on innovation and the ability to manage change. These manufacturers are subject to constant pressure on margins, challenges with cross border shipments, strains on material availability and cost control initiatives.  They require agile and effective global supply chains. All of these challenges need to be met while complying with standards and industry regulations. QAD solutions are used by many high technology companies that manufacture a diverse range of products. QAD focuses on the following three sectors in the high technology industry: standalone devices and test equipment; batteries, power supplies and lighting; and cable, wiring and connectors. High technology companies often face the challenges of very complex product structures with a need for traceability of parts and processes throughout their entire supply chain, as well as tight control of engineering changes. Many high technology companies providing complex systems also face the challenge of managing installation and support of equipment after sale, in addition to managing field engineering resources. A high technology manufacturer can use QAD’s solutions to configure product based on customers’ preference; manufacture and assemble product according to a customized specification; and schedule, install and support equipment throughout its lifecycle.

Industrial Products: Today’s global customers are demanding more configure-to-order, make-to-order, and assemble-to-order products. As a result, the modern, agile industrial manufacturer must be responsive to demands while managing tight margins, operational challenges and rapid changes to product features. QAD customers manufacture products as diverse as machine tools; specialist ceramic materials used in aerospace and defense; and equipment used in the oil and gas industries. Fluctuating demand leads to significant challenges in managing the internal supply chain, coordinating the extended vendor ecosystem, controlling costs, ensuring quality, tracking production, and optimizing inventory levels. Companies in this broad vertical market have requirements to maintain many manufacturing methodologies, often within the same enterprise. QAD focuses on the following four sectors in the industrial products industry: flexible packaging; engineered materials; standalone equipment; and roll stock and wire cable. Our solutions support multiple manufacturing methodologies in parallel, including lean manufacturing. The need for traceability of materials from source through to the finished product is often important to our customers, and QAD’s capabilities in traceability and serialization support this feature.
 
Our focus on these vertical markets gives us a competitive advantage by providing a solution developed specifically for our target customers, without the complexity and distraction of functionality they don’t want and don’t need. While some vendors provide broader solutions built for many industries, our targeted vertical focus allows our customers to implement our solutions with fewer configurations and customizations than our competitors require, enabling less complex and faster implementations, along with easier upgrades. We leverage our vertical market expertise in research and development, to meet specific industry needs; in sales, to understand our customer’s unique requirements; in presales, to demonstrate how these requirements are handled in the software; and in services, to apply best practices in the optimization of business processes and the implementation of the software. Our options to sell our product in the cloud or as on-premises licenses enable customers operating in multiple locations to choose a deployment option that best meets their unique needs.

Our cloud architecture encompasses infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, management, monitoring and security; providing a world-class development operations practice built around ITIL standards. QAD’s cloud infrastructure operates on a platform that enables QAD to seamlessly deploy customer systems to one of a number of global cloud infrastructure providers as part of the QAD Cloud offering.  Our cloud delivery centers are certified under the ISO 9001:2015 standard for quality management, the ISO 20000:2018 standard for service management (SMS), the ISO 27001:2013 standard for information security management (ISMS), the FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records and signatures, and the SSAE 18 (SOC I-Type II) requirements for reporting and compliance controls.
 
Cloud deployments for QAD Adaptive ERP are designed to be delivered as single tenant deployments. This decision was made based on our customers’ requirements for a mission critical system that they control. Providing customers with control over when to apply patches and upgrades reduces downtime and aligns to their business cycles. It also reduces the substantial costs associated with validation requirements in Life Sciences.
 
QAD takes a pragmatic approach to technology that is use case focused. We engage with our customers through experimentation in the QAD Labs. QAD Labs is a combination of people, technology and passion for addressing the challenges of manufacturing planning and operations. The guiding force behind QAD Labs is the collaboration between QAD and our customers. This collaboration involves experimenting with advanced technologies and new processes to address legacy or emerging challenges as well as industry disruption. The experimentation is not hindered by the large budgeting cycles of major projects. By design, the QAD Labs approach allows for rapid application, rapid evaluation and strategic pivots to build on success or investigate alternatives.
 
This experimentation can be aligned with typical Digital Transformation activities and associated technologies such as IoT, Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation and Data Lakes. Alternatively, the initiative can be associated with innovation to solve long-term problems with the explosion of emerging new technologies. The pilot projects include integrated shop floor connectivity, traceability and robotic process automation.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
We continued to see our customers’ businesses evolve during fiscal 2020 as they work through the geopolitical uncertainty facing global manufacturing. With continued pressure on supply chains caused by disruptive import tariffs, our customers have had to adapt their business models to deal with supply shortages and increased costs. We maintain a global research and development (R&D) organization that provides new product functionality to the market on a semiannual basis, which enables us to respond to industry disruptions and regulatory changes.
 
The transition from selling on-premises licenses to selling cloud solutions has continued within the enterprise software industry. With cloud solutions, customers are expecting that their software is kept up to date as part of the offering and that security is continuously being verified and updated to guard against security breaches. In fiscal 2020, we released a major upgrade to our software suite that delivered supply chain efficiencies, deeper integration into shop floor operations and deeper reporting of manufacturing activities. Our latest agile manufacturing module and production planning and scheduling functions are now integrated deeply into the shop floor execution and reporting processes.
 
During fiscal 2020, we introduced our latest release of QAD Adaptive Applications and its core ERP solution, which runs on the QAD Enterprise Platform using the Adaptive User Experience (UX).  This latest release further enhances our customers’ ability to intelligently adopt and boost adaptive manufacturing capabilities. Adaptive Manufacturing Enterprises can effectively address the increasing pace of change and disruption companies face today. QAD’s R&D team has taken great pride in delivering new capabilities that allow manufacturers to better address tomorrow’s challenges and rapidly respond to disruption in the marketplace. The Adaptive User Experience has also been implemented in the QAD Supplier Portal, QAD Dynasys Demand Supply Chain Planning and QAD Precision Global Trade & Transportation Execution solutions. The QAD Enterprise Platform has added capabilities that allow users and developers to securely create extensions or applications with little or no coding. We have improved the developer life cycle when creating new applications with added capabilities around type scripting and formula processing. Additionally, we have improved error handling to better address data retrieval issues, enhance data access and usage of the built in REST API’s.

We dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to R&D to continually enhance and expand our product suite, including through our internationalization program focused on legal compliance for our global customers operating across borders. As we ended fiscal 2020, we were supporting our customers in 68 countries with a single software solution. We continue to see a global trend toward electronic invoicing and registration of shipments and invoices with government agencies to prevent falsification and tax evasion. Spain, Mexico and Italy all introduced legislation that required all invoices to be registered with the government. All of our customers in these countries installed our Electronic Invoicing solution in fiscal 2020 in order to meet the new government regulations. We also see a continued tightening of tax legislation around the world. India introduced a new Value Added Tax (VAT) process that required all companies to file VAT during fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, the Indian government added electronic invoicing in their requirements. We continue to support our customers through these changes without interruption to their businesses. We see government regulations changing continuously across the globe. Our goal is to continue to provide our customers with software that assists them in meeting the legal requirements of the countries in which they do business.
 
Our R&D organization is comprised of 455 employees located in offices in the United States, India, China, Ireland, Australia, France, Belgium, Spain, Brazil, Great Britain, Indonesia and Poland. Our R&D expenses totaled $54.7 million, $54.0 million and $47.7 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our software is primarily developed internally; however, we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities when we require additional resources or specific skills or knowledge. All outside development is managed by our internal R&D organization. As needed, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties. We continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining enough competitive advantage to justify their costs. We routinely translate our product suite into fourteen languages and through our internationalization program we support mandatory governmental regulations and reporting requirements for 68 countries. This is accomplished through a single offering for our customers in the cloud or on-premises, allowing them to run their businesses using a consistent core business model with the deployment model of their choice. Our development focus is on cloud deployments first. Hence, some functionality that is available to our cloud customers may not be available to our on-premises customers or may have an additional fee associated with it.  
 
We plan to continue to manage significant product development operations globally over the next several years. We believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development at lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities. We continually assess the significant costs and challenges, including intellectual property protection, against the benefits of our international development activities. 
 
DIRECT AND INDIRECT SALES
 
QAD sells its products and services through direct and indirect sales channels located throughout the regions of North America, Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Each region leverages global standards and systems to enhance consistency when interacting with global customers. Additionally, we have a global account team, and strategic business teams focused on sectors facing the greatest level of disruption where we can provide the greatest product fit.
 
Our direct sales organization includes approximately 65 commissioned sales people. Supporting our commissioned sales people are vertical experts, business development representatives, business consultants, pre-sales employees responsible for leading demonstrations of our software solutions and customer service representatives supporting our existing customers. Incentive pay is a significant portion of the total compensation package for our sales staff. We continually align our sales organization and business strategies with market conditions to maintain an effective sales process. We cultivate the industries we serve within each territory through marketing, local product development and sales training.
 
Our indirect sales channel consists of approximately 50 distributors and sales agents worldwide. We do not grant exclusive rights to any of our distributors or sales agents. Our distributors and sales agents primarily sell independently to companies within their geographic territory but may also work in conjunction with our direct sales organization. We also identify global sales opportunities through our relationships with implementation service providers, hardware vendors and other third parties.
 
MARKETING
 
Our marketing strategy is to differentiate our offering by focusing on our role in enabling manufacturers to overcome the greatest challenges they face (change and uncertainty) and to support them in achieving the vision of the Adaptive Manufacturing Enterprise. We do this by highlighting QAD’s Next Generation Adaptive ERP and its five rapid response technologies that deliver greater fit for today and the flexibility to meet tomorrow’s business requirements.
 
We are targeting sectors within our primary verticals with the greatest disruption and where we can provide the best fit; those companies with the greatest need whom we can help the most.
 
Our main marketing objectives are to leverage the measurable success in business outcomes our customers have achieved and highlight hidden costs prospects may face with legacy ERP to increase awareness and drive leads in these target sectors. We do this by openly and consistently communicating with QAD customers, prospects, partners, investors and other key audiences. Our primary marketing activities include:
 

● | Account based marketing (ABM) for targeting, assessing buying intent, and display advertising;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We recognize the changing buying dynamics and are focused on engaging with prospects early in the sales cycle in order to help set the buying criteria and specifications in a way that uniquely leads to QAD. We seek to accelerate prospects through the buying journey by demonstrating the value of our products, answering questions, and removing roadblocks.
 
Corporate Marketing supports our regional and strategic business marketing teams, working closely with their respective business development and sales teams.
 
COMPETITION
 
Our business is affected by strong competition from both enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application services providers. The markets for our offerings are rapidly evolving, highly competitive and are subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new applications. Our customers demand greater performance and reliability with lower complexity. Fit, cost, speed, and flexibility are primary criteria in our customers’ decision-making processes.
 
We compete with large, well-established enterprise application vendors, such as SAP, Oracle and Infor, among others, who hold significant market share in the traditional ERP marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources and name recognition; and have established broad market solutions by developing applications targeted at many industries, not just manufacturing. Internationally, we face competition from local companies, as well as the large enterprise application competitors, many of which have products tailored for those local markets.
 
Most enterprise application vendors today have some focus on cloud solutions, in addition to on-premises sales, which creates an environment in which we face competition from a variety of vendors that address one or more of our applications. As a result, our cloud solutions compete with both large enterprise software vendors and cloud computing application service providers. In addition, other vendors that provide services in different markets may develop solutions in our target markets and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal solutions.
 
We believe the key competitive factors in our markets are:
 

• | Solution fit, breadth and functionality 
--+---------------------------------------------------
• | Flexibility, integration, security and scalability
• | Customer satisfaction 


• | Speed and ease of deployment and use of applications
--+-----------------------------------------------------
• | Minimal customizations needed 


• | Total cost of ownership
--+------------------------


• | Performance and reliability 
--+----------------------------------------
• | Speed and ease of time version upgrades


• | Technological innovation and ability to respond to customer needs rapidly
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial resources and
--+------------------------


• | Reputation of the vendor
--+-------------------------

 
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our Adaptive ERP and Enterprise Platform architecture facilitate rapid deployment, ease of upgrades and eliminate the need for majority significant amount of customizations. To further our market success, we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors’ innovations. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on our efforts in the areas of product development and sales, services and support operations.
