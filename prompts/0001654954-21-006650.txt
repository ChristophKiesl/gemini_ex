 Overview
  
 We operate primarily in the healthcare industry and provide services that include management consulting related to sales, marketing, business development and advisory board functions to healthcare organizations; and financial incentive program services to identify grants, tax credits and other government incentives for companies across a variety of industries including healthcare. We conduct all our operations through our wholly owned subsidiary, HBR Business Development, LLC and HBR Pointclear, LLC. Unless context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “our,” “us” and “our Company” refer to Healthcare Business Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation, and all subsidiaries.
 Principal Services
  
 We are in our development stage. We plan to generate revenue by providing consulting services. These services include:
  
   ●
 management consulting related to sales, marketing, business development and advisory board functions to healthcare organizations; and

   ●
 financial incentive program services to identify grants, tax credits and other government incentives for companies across a variety of industries including healthcare.

 
 Our management, board of advisors and board of directors have extensive experience in market expansion strategies, financial analysis, acquisition integration, management consulting and training, healthcare law, corporate law, capital markets, mergers and acquisitions. We believe the combined experience, knowledge, credibility and connections of our people are unique and potentially valuable to prospective clients. As a result, even though we are a new business with no revenues to date, we believe we will successfully execute our business plan. See “Description of Business - Our Competitive Strengths.”
  
  Management consulting services
  
 Our management consulting services are designed to help clients increase revenue, improve overall efficiency of their operations, grow strategically and increase profitability. We provide clients with advice and assistance tailored to address each client’s challenges and opportunities, with a focus on healthcare organizations that face operational and financial changes. We believe that distressed companies respond to challenges by restructuring their business and capital structure, while healthy companies strive to capitalize on opportunities by improving operations, reducing costs and maximizing revenue. Many organizations have limited resources dedicated to respond effectively to challenges and opportunities. As a result, we believe many organizations seek to supplement their internal resources with experienced independent consultants like us.
  
 As part of our management consulting services, we will perform an initial review of a prospective clients relevant financial, tax and business documentation at no cost to determine areas for potential corporate improvement and growth opportunities.
  
 We plan to charge clients a fee for our management consulting services based on time (e.g. hourly or monthly) or based on a percentage of cost savings or incremental revenue (e.g. revenue or cost savings). As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we have acquired one customer who has contracted with us to market its services in exchange for a performance-based fee equal to 50% of any fee collected by this customer from business referred by our Company to this customer. We cannot estimate the value of the fee or fees we may obtain from this engagement, if any. As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, have not generated any management consulting services revenue and we are unable to determine how long, if ever, it will take to generate any management consulting services revenue. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate enough management consulting revenue to sustain our operations.
  
  Financial incentive program services
  
 Our financial incentive program services are designed to identify grants, tax credits and other government incentives for companies across a variety of industries including healthcare. We will assist with advising on and documenting business processes related to such credits and rebates and work with certified public accounting firms and business owners to compile reports and documentation required to apply for various financial incentive programs.
  
 As part of our financial incentive program services, we will perform an initial review of a prospective client’s relevant financial, tax and business documentation at no cost to determine the potential economic benefits from various federal and state incentive programs.
  
 We plan to charge clients a fee primarily based on the economic benefit we facilitate from any incentive programs, when permitted by any applicable rules and guidelines. Where contingency fees are not permissible, fixed fee contracts may be used. As part of our incentive program services, we may be at risk for certain third-party accounting, legal and consulting fees until such time as we are reimbursed by our client, if ever.

 As of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we have acquired one customer who has contracted with us to assess, evaluate and implement our financial incentive program services. Specifically, we contracted with a software company that delivers structured reporting and coding solutions to healthcare facilities ranging from small practices to large hospital systems. The client is owned by a non-affiliate Selling Stockholder. We contracted to provide financial incentive services, including assistance to identify potential grants, incentives, refunds, tax credits and future savings/and or programs that might be available as well as to make recommendations to optimize growth and profitability. Under the terms of the agreement, we and our third-party consultants, will pursue any economic benefits identified on behalf of our client but performing additional services, including but not limited to further review of financial and tax information, tax planning, program application, accounting work and preparation and filing of tax returns and/or amendments and work with the client to optimize process improvement and documentation. Under the terms of our agreement, our fees are 5% of the economic benefit obtained as a result of our services, are earned upon performing of the services but we have agreed to accept payment for services rendered to within 10 days of our client receiving any financial incentives from the United States Treasury or other Government organization. While we estimate the value of our fee for this engagement to be approximately $7,500, there is no assurance we will be successful at providing the Services or that the client will receive the estimated economic benefit.
  
 Currently, have multiple consulting opportunities in various stages of active review by potential customers; however, we cannot assure you that any of these potential customers will engage our Company for services. Further, we cannot assure you that we will ever generate enough financial incentive program revenue to sustain our Company’s operations.
  
  Strategy
  
 The key elements of our business model and growth strategy are as follows:
  
   1.
 Attract highly qualified advisors and consultants. We believe performance-based compensation, including stock option plan participation, will enable us to attract top talent. In the near term, we plan to primarily engage independent advisors and consultants to minimize our fixed operating expenses. To date, we have entered into advisory board agreements with advisors who have healthcare industry experience in market expansion strategies, financial analysis, acquisition integration, management consulting and training, healthcare law, corporate law, capital markets, mergers and acquisitions.

 
   2.
 Grow our network of potential clients. We plan to grow our network of healthcare and other organizations that could benefit from our services. To be successful, we must establish and strengthen the awareness of our brand. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand recognition is an important aspect of our efforts to generate revenue. In the near term, we plan to promote awareness of our services through public relations efforts, social media outreach, Internet marketing and business development partnerships. Our goal is to attract healthcare and other organizations who are primarily interested in growing their business through sales, marketing and business development.

 
   3.
 Pursue strategic acquisitions. We intend to evaluate select acquisitions of complementary businesses as another means to broaden the scope of our capabilities and our client base. For example, we are interested in acquiring companies that provide consulting, training, education, marketing, audits, cost recovery, group purchasing, compliance, certification, security, information technology and other non-clinical healthcare business services. We believe strategic acquisitions can enable us to scale our revenue with less business risk. While we have not pursued any potential acquisition targets to date or have any agreements to acquire any business at this time, any future acquisition may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us and we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business.

 
  Sales and Marketing
  
 We presently identify prospective management consulting and financial incentive program opportunities through personal and professional relationships of our CEO Stephen Epstein. In the future, we plan to pay for online advertisements and may enter into third-party marketing agreements to expand our reach.
  
 We also plan to position ourselves as an opinion leader in the field through the creation of media and content; podcasts, articles, essays and other such materials to build good PR for the business and attract interest for our various consulting and advisory services. This includes possibly exhibiting and speaking at conferences and advertising in trade journals, associations, etc. We also plan to generate referral and word-of-mouth programs to drive interest for services.
  
 Our marketing budget is subject to several factors, including our results of operations and cash flow. If our results of operations exceed our expectations over the next twelve months, we expect to increase significantly our marketing budget, which we expect will enable us to increase revenues. At present, there is no direct correlation between revenues and marketing expenses.
  
  Competition
  
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. The market for our services is competitive and rapidly changing, and the barriers to entry are relatively low. We experience competition from large established businesses possessing large, existing customer bases, substantial financial resources and established distribution channels. We expect competition to persist and intensify in the future. Competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our services to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business and our operating results could be harmed. Our principal competitors include any entity or individual providing consulting services, but not limited to business consultants, growth consultants, sales consultants, marketing consultants, distribution consultants and financial consultants.

 Our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their offerings. Our current and potential competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have. If we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our offering could substantially decline.
  
  Our Competitive Strengths
  
 We believe our competitive strength comes from our people, our approach to business and our business model.
  
   1.
 Our people: Our management, board of advisors and board of directors have extensive experience and relationships in market expansion strategies, financial analysis, acquisition integration, management consulting and training, healthcare law, corporate law, capital markets, mergers and acquisitions. We believe the combined experience, knowledge, credibility and connections of our people are unique and potentially valuable to prospective clients.

 
   2.
 Our business approach: We believe that the best business relationships provide tangible benefits to each party. A central tenet of our business approach is to ensure that we can provide significant value to a prospective client before entering into any services agreement. To understand the scope of a potential engagement and ensure we can satisfy the prospective clients’ primary objectives of any engagement, we are willing and able to spend time with their management team, on a completely complimentary basis, to discuss challenges and opportunities and perform an initial review of their relevant financial, tax and business circumstances. We believe the business approach of investing time and effort upfront and before any service engagement, helps establish trust and credibility, while enabling us and the prospective client to better determine if and how we can add value before entering into any agreement.

 
   3.
 3.Our business model: Aside from the traditional management consulting services model where compensation is based on an hourly or monthly fee, our business model supports the engagement with clients on a performance basis. We believe that offering select clients the option to compensate us based entirely on the tangible value we provide is uncommon in our field and may enable us to attract and retain clients in competitive scenarios.

 
  Intellectual Property
  
 We do not own anHealthcareBusinessResources.com domain name. To protect our proprietary rights, we will generally rely on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties.
  
 Third parties may copy or obtain and use our proprietary ideas, know-how and other proprietary information without authorization or independently develop similar or superior intellectual property. Our competitors may obtain proprietary rights that would prevent, or limit or interfere with our ability to sell our services. If we are found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others and may be required to incur substantial costs to defend any litigation, cease offering our services, obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right or redesign our services.
  
 Legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights are still evolving. We cannot be sure of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights or of similar rights of other companies within this market. We cannot be certain that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary information.
  
  Any litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
  
  Technology
  
 We currently use off the shelf technology to operate our business.
  
  Regulation of our Business
  
 We are not currently subject to direct regulation by any governmental agency other than laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses. We are subject to common business, tax and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business. We believe that compliance of governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of our management.
  
   
7


  
 
  Employees
  
 We have one full-time employee and one part-time subcontracted accountant in the United States. From time to time, we expect to employ additional independent contractors as well as legal, accounting and other specialized professionals to support our sales, marketing, business development and administrative needs.
  
 Our success will depend on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified marketing, sales, technical and other personnel. Qualified personnel are in high demand. We face considerable competition from other management consulting service firms for these personnel, many of which have significantly greater resources than we have.
  
  Properties
  
 Our corporate headquarters is in Nashville, Tennessee. Substantially all our operating activities are conducted from 400 square feet of office space provided by our CEO at no charge. We believe that additional space may be required as our business expands and believe that we can obtain suitable space as needed.
