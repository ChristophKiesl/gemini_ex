Item 1.Business
General Overview
New Media Investment Group Inc. (“New Media,” “Company,” “us,” or “we”), was formed as a Delaware corporation on June 18, 2013. Pursuant to the Restructuring (as defined below), Newcastle Investment Corp. (“Newcastle”) owned approximately 84.6% of New Media until February 13, 2014, upon which date Newcastle distributed the shares that it held in New Media to its shareholders on a prorata basis. New Media had no operations until November 26, 2013, when it assumed control of GateHouse Media, LLC (formerly known as GateHouse Media, Inc.) (“GateHouse” or “Predecessor”) and Local Media Group Holdings LLC (“Local Media Parent”). GateHouse was determined to be the predecessor to New Media, as the operations of GateHouse comprise substantially all of the business operations of the combined entities. Both New Media and Newcastle are externally managed and advised by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (“Fortress”).
New Media is a company that owns, operates and invests in high quality local media assets. We have a particular focus on owning and acquiring strong local media assets in small to mid-size markets. With our collection of assets, we focus on two large business categories; consumers and small to medium size businesses (“SMBs”).
Our portfolio of media assets today spans across 489 markets and 31 states. Our products include 564 community print publications, 489 websites, 476 mobile sites and six yellow page directories. We reach over 19 million people per week and serve over 193,000 business customers.
We are focused on growing our consumer revenues primarily through our penetration into the local consumer market that values comprehensive local news and receives their news primarily from our products. We believe our rich local content, our strong media brands, and multiple platforms for delivering content will impact our reach into the local consumers leading to growth in subscription income. We also believe our focus on smaller markets will allow us to be a dominant provider of valuable, unique local news to consumers in those markets. We believe that one result of our local consumer penetration in these smaller markets will be transaction revenues as we link consumers with local businesses. For our SMB business category, we focus on leveraging our strong local media brands, our in-market sales force and our high consumer penetration rates with a variety of products and services that we believe will help SMBs expand their marketing, advertising and other digital lead generation platforms. We also believe our strong position in our local markets will allow us to develop other products that will be of value to our SMBs in helping them run and grow their businesses.
Our business strategy is to be the preeminent provider of local news, information, advertising and digital services in the markets we operate in today. We aim to grow our business organically through both our consumer and SMB strategies. We also plan to pursue strategic acquisitions of high quality local media assets at attractive valuation levels. Finally, we intend to distribute a substantial portion of our free cash flow as a dividend to stockholders through a quarterly dividend, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our board of directors (the “Board of Directors” or “Board”) and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement (as defined below). The Board of Directors’ determinations regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) net income, free cash flow generated from operations or other sources, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results.
We believe that our focus on owning and operating dominant local-content-oriented media properties in small to mid-size markets puts us in a position to better execute our strategy. We believe that being the dominant provider of local news and information in the markets in which we operate and distributing that content across multiple print and digital platforms, gives us an opportunity to grow our audiences and reach. Further, we believe our strong local media brands and our in-market sales presence gives us the opportunity to expand our advertising and lead generation products with local business customers.
Central to our business strategy are our digital marketing services products called Propel Marketing (“Propel”). We launched the products in 2012 and have seen rapid growth since then. Revenues have grown from $1 million in 2012 to $31.3 million in 2015. We believe Propel and our other digital marketing service products, combined with our strong local brands and in market sales force, position this product group to be a key component to our overall organic growth strategy.
We believe that Propel will allow us to capitalize on the following opportunities in the marketplace:
There are approximately 27.9 million SMBs in the U.S. according to the 2011 U.S. Census data. Of these, approximately 26.7 million have 20 employees or less.
1

Many of the owners and managers of these SMBs do not have resources or expertise to navigate the fast evolving digital marketing sector, but are increasingly aware of the need to establish and maintain a digital presence in order to stay connected with current and future customers.
Propel is designed to offer a complete set of turn-key digital marketing services to SMBs that provides transparent results to the business owners. Propel provides four broad categories of services: building businesses a presence, helping businesses to be located by consumers online, engaging with consumers, and growing their customer base.
We believe our local media properties and local sales infrastructure are uniquely positioned to sell these digital marketing services to local business owners and give us distinct advantages, including:

• | our strong and trusted local brands, with 85% of our daily newspapers having been publishing local content for more than 100 years;


• | our ability to market through our print and online properties, driving branding and traffic; and


• | our more than 1,480 local, direct, in-market sales professionals with long standing relationships with small businesses in the communities we serve.

Our core products include:

• | 124 daily newspapers with total paid circulation of approximately 1.5 million;


• | 322 weekly newspapers (published up to three times per week) with total paid circulation of approximately 321,000 and total free circulation of approximately 2.0 million;


• | 118 “shoppers” (generally advertising-only publications) with total circulation of approximately 2.8 million;


• | 489 locally focused websites and 476 mobile sites, which extend our businesses onto the internet and mobile devices with approximately 226 million page views per month;


• | six yellow page directories, with a distribution of approximately 348,000, that cover a population of approximately 620,000 people; and


• | Propel digital marketing services.

In addition to our core products, we also opportunistically produce niche publications that address specific local market interests such as recreation, sports, healthcare and real estate. Similarly, GateHouse Live, our events business, concentrates on local markets and interests.
Our print and online products focus on the local community from a content, advertising, and digital marketing perspective. As a result of our focus on small and midsize markets, we are usually the primary, and sometimes, the sole provider of comprehensive and in-depth local market news and information in the communities we serve. Our content is primarily devoted to topics that we believe are highly relevant and of interest to our audience such as local news and politics, community and regional events, youth sports, opinion and editorial pages, local schools, obituaries, weddings and police reports.
More than 85% of our daily newspapers have been published for more than 100 years and 100% have been published for more than 50 years. We believe that the longevity of our publications demonstrates the value and relevance of the local information that we provide and has created a strong foundation of reader loyalty and a highly recognized media brand name in each community we serve. As a result of these factors, we believe that our publications have high local audience penetration rates in our markets, thereby providing advertisers with strong local market reach.
We believe the large number of publications we have, our focus on smaller markets, and our geographic diversity also provide the following benefits to our strategy:

• | Diversified revenue streams, both in terms of customers and markets;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from clustering of business assets;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from centralization of back office functions;


• | Operational efficiencies realized from improved buying power for key operating cost items through our increased size and scale;


• | Ability to provide consistent management practices and ensure best practices; and


• | Less competition and high barriers to entry.

The newspaper industry has experienced declining revenue and profitability dating back to 2007 due to, among other things, advertisers’ shift from print to digital media and general market conditions. Our Predecessor was affected by this trend and experienced a history of net operating losses.
The revenues derived from our SMB category come from a variety of print and digital advertising products, digital service products we offer through Propel, and commercial printing services. Our consumer category revenue comes primarily from subscription income as consumers pay for our deep, rich local contents, both in print and online, however primarily print today.
Our operating costs consist primarily of labor, newsprint, and delivery costs. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of labor costs. Compensation represents just under 50% of our operating expenses. Over the last few years, we have worked to drive efficiencies through centralization of back office functions, outsourcing and leveraging our scale to purchase more effectively. Additionally, we have taken steps to cluster our operations, thereby increasing the usage of facilities and equipment while increasing the productivity of our labor force. We expect to continue to employ these steps as part of our business and clustering strategy.
Local Media Acquisition
Newcastle acquired Local Media Group Inc. (formerly known as Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc.) (“Local Media”) on September 3, 2013 from News Corp. Inc. and contributed to New Media 100% of the stock of Local Media Parent (which owns all of Local Media’s stock) on GateHouse’s emergence from bankruptcy on November 26, 2013 (the “Effective Date”). In exchange for the contribution of Local Media, Newcastle received shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Media (“New Media Common Stock” or our “Common Stock”), equal in value to the cost of the acquisition of Local Media by Newcastle (“Local Media Acquisition”). Local Media Parent became a wholly owned subsidiary of New Media.
GateHouse managed the assets of Local Media pursuant to a management and advisory agreement (“Local Media Management Agreement”). The agreement had a two-year term, with automatic renewal for successive two-year periods unless terminated. While the agreement was in effect, GateHouse received an annual management fee of $1.1 million, subject to adjustments (up to a maximum annual management fee of $1.2 million), and an annual incentive compensation fee based on exceeding EBITDA targets of Local Media. The Local Media Management Agreement was terminated effective June 4, 2014.
Restructuring and Spin-off from Newcastle Investment Corp.
We acquired our operations as part of the restructuring (the “Restructuring”) of our Predecessor, GateHouse. On September 27, 2013, GateHouse commenced the Restructuring in which it sought confirmation of its bankruptcy plan sponsored by Newcastle, as the holder of the majority of the Outstanding Debt (as defined as follows). The Plan relates to the Restructuring of our Predecessor’s obligations under the amended and restated credit agreement by and among certain affiliates of GateHouse, the lenders from time to time thereto and Cortland Products Group, as administrative agent, dated February 27, 2007 (as amended, the “2007 Credit Facility”) and certain interest rate swaps (collectively, the “Outstanding Debt”). The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the reorganization plan (the “Plan”) on November 6, 2013 and GateHouse consequently emerged from Chapter 11 protection on November 26, 2013.
Pursuant to the Restructuring, Newcastle offered to purchase the Outstanding Debt in cash and at 40% of (i) $1,167 million of principal claims under the 2007 Credit Facility, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest at the applicable contract non-default rate with respect thereto, plus (iii) all amounts, excluding any default interest, arising from transactions in connection with interest rate swaps secured under the 2007 Credit Facility (the “Cash-Out Offer”) on the Effective Date. The holders of the Outstanding Debt had the option of receiving, in satisfaction of their Outstanding Debt, their pro rata share of the (i) Cash-Out Offer or (ii) New Media Common Stock and net proceeds, if any, of the GateHouse Credit Facilities. All pensions, trade and all other unsecured claims will be paid in the ordinary course.
On the Effective Date (1) GateHouse became our wholly-owned subsidiary as a result of (a) the cancellation and discharge of the currently outstanding equity interests in GateHouse (the holders of which received warrants issued by New Media) and (b) the issuance of equity interests in the reorganized GateHouse to New Media; (2) Local Media Parent, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newcastle, following the Local Media Acquisition became a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Media as a result of Newcastle’s transfer of Local Media Parent to New Media; (3) New Media entered into the Management Agreement (as defined below) with our Manager (as defined below), (4) New Media entered into the GateHouse Management and Advisory Agreement (the “GateHouse Management Agreement”) with GateHouse; and (5) all of GateHouse’s Outstanding Debt was cancelled and discharged and the holders of the Outstanding Debt received, at their option, their pro rata share of the (i) Cash-Out Offer or (ii) New Media Common Stock and the net proceeds of the two certain Term Loan and Security Agreements dated November 26, 2013 (the “GateHouse Credit Facilities”). Pursuant to the Cash-Out Offer, Newcastle

offered to buy the claims of the holders of the Outstanding Debt. As a result of these transactions, Newcastle owned 84.6% of New Media as of the Effective Date. The GateHouse Management Agreement was terminated effective June 4, 2014.
On the Effective Date, New Media entered into a management agreement with FIG LLC (the “Manager”) (the “Management Agreement”) pursuant to which the Manager will manage the operations of New Media. The annual management fee is 1.50% of New Media’s Total Equity (as defined in the Management Agreement) and the Manager is eligible to receive incentive compensation.
On September 27, 2013, Newcastle announced that its board of directors unanimously approved a plan to spin-off our Company. Newcastle’s board of directors made the determination to spin-off our assets because it believed that our value can be increased over time through a strategy aimed at acquiring local media assets and organically growing our digital marketing business.
In order to effect the separation and spin-off of our Company, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended, which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 30, 2014.
Each share of Newcastle common stock outstanding as of 5:00 PM, Eastern Time, on February 6, 2014, the Record Date, entitled the holder thereof to receive 0.07219481485 shares of our Common Stock (the “Distribution” or the “spin-off”). The spin-off was completed on February 13, 2014. Immediately thereafter, we became a publicly traded company independent from Newcastle trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “NEWM.”
Acquisitions
On February 28, 2014, we completed the acquisition of five publications from Freedom Communications for a total purchase price of $7.9 million, including working capital. The acquisition included two daily and three weekly publications serving Southern California with an aggregate circulation of approximately 56,000.
On June 30, 2014, we completed two acquisitions of 20 publications with a total purchase price of $15.9 million, including working capital. The acquisitions included six daily, ten weekly publications, and four shoppers serving areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Virginia with an aggregate circulation of approximately 54,000.
On September 3, 2014, we completed the acquisition of The Providence Journal with a total purchase price of $48.7 million, including working capital. The acquisition included one daily and two weekly publications serving areas of Rhode Island with a daily circulation of approximately 72,000 and 96,000 on Sunday.
On December 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Foster’s Daily Democrat along with other publications and related assets for $5.4 million in cash, including working capital, from the Foster family. The publications are located around Dover, NH, and the daily newspaper has a circulation of approximately 12,000.
On January 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets from Halifax Media Group for an aggregate purchase price of $285.4 million, including working capital and net of assumed debt. The acquisition included 24 daily publications, thirteen weekly publications, and five shoppers serving areas of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and South Carolina with a daily circulation of approximately 635,000 and 752,000 on Sunday.
On March 18, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Stephens Media, LLC (“Stephens Media”) for an aggregate purchase price of $110.8 million, including working capital. The acquisition includes nine daily newspapers, 35 weekly publications and fifteen shoppers serving communities throughout the United States with a combined average daily circulation of approximately 221 and 244 on Sunday.
On June 15, 2015 and September 23, 2015, we acquired substantially all the assets, properties and business of publishing/operating certain newspapers for an aggregate purchase price of $52.0 million, including estimated working capital. The acquisitions included two daily newspapers, twenty-eight weekly publications, and two shoppers serving Central Ohio and Southern Michigan.
Dispositions
On December 10, 2015, we completed the sale of the Las Vegas Review-Journal and related publications (initially acquired in the Stephens Media acquisition), which are located in Las Vegas, Nevada for an aggregate sale price of $140,000 plus working capital adjustment of $1,000. As a result, a gain of $57.0 million is included in (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for this period.

Industry Overview
We operate in what is sometimes referred to as the “hyper-local” or community news market and market within the media industry. Media companies that serve this segment provide highly focused local content and advertising that is generally unique to each market they serve and is not readily obtainable from other sources. Local publications include community newspapers, websites, shoppers, traders, real estate guides, special interest magazines and directories. Due to the unique local nature of their content and audience, community publications compete for advertising customers with other forms of traditional media, including direct mail, directories, radio, television, and outdoor advertising. They also compete with new local and national digital and social media businesses for advertising, digital services and customers. We believe that local print and online publications in smaller markets are the most effective medium for local retail advertising, which emphasizes the price of goods in an effort to move inventory on a regular basis, in contrast to radio, broadcast and cable, television, and the internet, which are generally used for image or branding advertising. In addition, we believe local print and online publications generally have the highest local audience penetration rates, which allows local advertisers to get their message to a large portion of the local audience. Finally, national digital competitors tend to have no local in-market sales presence which we believe gives the local community publications an advantage when selling these types of products and services.
Locally focused media in small and midsize communities is distinct from national and urban media delivered through outlets such as television, radio, metropolitan and national newspapers and the internet. Larger media outlets tend to offer broad based information to a geographically scattered audience, which tends to be more of a commodity. In contrast, locally focused media delivers a highly focused product that is often the only source of local news and information in the market it serves. Our segment of the media industry is also characterized by high barriers to entry, both economic and social. Small and midsize communities can generally only sustain one newspaper. Moreover, the brand value associated with long-term reader and advertiser loyalty, and the high start-up costs associated with developing and distributing content and selling advertisements, help to limit competition.
We also believe there is a growing need among small to mid-size businesses to be able to generate leads and interact with consumers across all the digital platforms, which takes many forms including websites, mobile sites, tablets and social media. These local business owners and managers lack the time, expertise and resources to capitalize on the potential of these new consumer-reaching channels. National competitors in this category do not generally have a local in-market presence. Newly formed competitors lack a known and credible brand name in addition to generally not having a local in-market presence. We believe this represents a substantial opportunity for our local media business.
Advertising Market
The primary sources of advertising revenue for local publications are small businesses, corporations, government agencies and individuals who reside in the market that a publication serves. By combining paid circulation publications with total market coverage (“TMC”) publications such as shoppers and other specialty publications (tailored to the specific attributes of a local community), local publications are able to reach nearly 100% of the households in a distribution area. As macroeconomic conditions in advertising change due to increasing internet and mobile usage and the wide array of available information sources, we have seen advertisers shift their focus to incorporate a digital advertising and services component into their overall local marketing strategy. To that end, in addition to printed products, the majority of our local publications have an online presence that further leverages the local brand, ensures higher penetration into the market, and provides a digital alternative for local advertisers to reach consumers. We also have strong digital marketing services, Propel.
Digital Media
The time spent online and on mobile devices each day by media consumers continues to grow and newspaper web and mobile sites offer a wide variety of content providing comprehensive, in-depth and up to the minute coverage of news and current events. The ability to generate, publish and archive more news and information than most other sources has allowed newspapers to produce some of the most visited sites on the internet. Newspaper websites have proven to be some of the most visited websites by online media news consumers.
We believe that our local publications are well positioned to capitalize on their existing market presence and grow their total audience base by publishing proprietary local content digitally: via the internet, mobile websites and mobile applications. Local digital media include traditional classifieds, directories of business information, local advertising, databases, audience-contributed content and mobile applications. We believe this additional community-specific content will further extend and expand both the reach and the brand of our publications with readers and advertisers. We believe that building a strong local digital business extends the core audience of a local publication.
The opportunity created by the digital extension of the core audience makes local digital advertising an attractive complement for existing print advertisers, while opening up opportunities to attract new local advertisers that have not 
6

previously advertised with local publications. In addition, we believe that national advertisers have an interest in reaching buyers on a hyper-local level and, although they historically have not been significant advertisers in community publications, we believe the digital media offers them a powerful medium to reach local audiences. This opportunity is further enhanced by our behavioral targeting products, which allow advertisers to reach specific demographics of our audience and follow that audience across multiple websites, delivering advertisements across the platforms. Further, digital marketing services businesses are poised to benefit from the rise in internet marketing spend, which grew 16% between 2013 and 2014, and 294% between 2005 and 2014, according to the 2014 IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report issued in April 2015.
We believe that a strong digital business will enhance our revenues. In addition, we believe that we have the expertise and sales resources to help other businesses maximize their digital opportunities. Accordingly, we have launched our digital marketing services business, including Propel, which is designed to help SMBs utilize the digital space to generate leads, interact with consumers and grow their businesses. New Media’s digital revenue derived from advertising, circulation, and other revenue has grown since the launch of Propel in 2012. New Media’s digital revenue was $106.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, an 85% growth as compared with the same period in 2014, which had digital revenue of $57.9 million. Of this, $31.3 million, or 29% of digital revenue for the year ended December 27, 2015 was attributable to Propel. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We have invested in growing our digital business, including Propel, but such investments may not be successful, which could adversely affect our results of operations.”
We anticipate that the digital marketing services sector will continue to grow as SMBs move from print to digital marketing in connection with consumers spending more time online. According to the 2011 U.S. Census data, there are approximately 27.9 million SMBs in the US, 26.7 million of the SMBs have 20 employees or less, and these businesses are expected to spend $42.6 billion on digital marketing by 2016 (according to the 2015 U.S. Local Media Forecast by BIA/Kelsey). Owners of these businesses often lack the resources and expertise to navigate the digital marketing services sector. A recent study done by SCORE Association in 2014 indicated that 97% of consumers search for local businesses online, 49% of SMBs do not have a website, 93% are not mobile compatible, and 27% of SMBs with websites were found to not have a phone number on their home page. Propel offers SMBs digital services, including website design, search engine optimization, mobile websites, social media, retargeting and other advertising services. Our Predecessor believed, and we too believe, that Propel is well positioned to assist SMBs in the digital space and expect Propel to contribute meaningfully to future revenue growth. Propel is also able to leverage our local media properties and local sales infrastructure and give us distinct advantages, including:

• | our strong and trusted local brands, with 85% of our daily newspapers having been publishing local content for more than 100 years;


• | our ability to market through our print and online properties, driving branding and traffic; and


• | our more than 1,480 local, direct, in-market sales professionals with long standing relationships with small businesses in the communities we serve.

Circulation
Overall daily newspaper print circulation, including national and urban newspapers, has been declining slowly over the past several years. Small and midsize local market newspapers have generally had smaller declines and more stability in their paid print circulation volumes due to the relevant and unique hyper-local news they produce combined with less competition than larger markets. In addition, we believe this unique and valuable hyper-local content along with multiple delivery platforms now available will allow smaller market newspapers to continue to raise prices, leading to stable circulation revenues. Data and technology now available to newspapers allow them to target pricing more at the household level rather than purely by market. This will lead to more effective pricing strategies and enhance stability for circulation revenues. According to the Newspaper Association of America, pay meters and pricing helped the newspaper industry grow circulation revenue by 9% from 2011 to 2013.
Our Strengths
High Quality Assets with Leading Local Businesses. Our publications benefit from a long history in the communities we serve as one of the leading, and often sole, providers of comprehensive and in-depth local content. More than 85% of our daily newspapers have been published for more than 100 years and 100% have been published for more than 50 years. This has resulted in brand recognition for our publications, reader loyalty and high local audience penetration rates, which are highly valued by local advertisers. We continue to build on long-standing relationships with local advertisers and our in-depth knowledge of the consumers in our local markets. We believe our local news content is unique and highly valued by consumers who live in our markets, and there are limited, and in some cases no competing sources of local content for our target customers.

Large Locally Focused Sales Force. We have large and well known “in-market” local sales forces in the markets we serve, consisting of over 1,480 sales representatives, including 42 dedicated to Propel and 17 third party sales affiliations. Our sales forces are generally among the largest locally oriented media sales forces in their respective communities. We have long-standing relationships with many local businesses and have the ability to be face to face with most local businesses due to these unique characteristics we enjoy. We believe our strong brands combined with our “in-market” presence give us a distinct advantage in selling and growing in the digital services sector given the complex nature of these products. We also believe that these qualities provide leverage for our sales force to grow additional future revenue streams in our markets, particularly in the digital sector.
Ability to Acquire and Integrate New Assets. We have created a national platform for consolidating local media businesses and have demonstrated an ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate local media asset acquisitions. Together with our Predecessor, we have acquired over $2.2 billion of assets since 2006, including both traditional newspaper and directory businesses. We have a scalable infrastructure and platform to leverage for future acquisitions.
Scale Yields Operating Profit Margins and Allows Us to Realize Operating Synergies. We believe we can generate higher operating profit margins than our publications could achieve on a stand-alone basis by leveraging our operations and implementing revenue initiatives, especially digital initiatives, across a broader local footprint in a geographic cluster and by centralizing certain back office production, accounting, administrative and corporate operations. We also benefit from economies of scale in the purchase of insurance, newsprint and other large strategic supplies and equipment. Finally, we have the ability to further leverage our centralized services and buying power to reduce operating costs when making future strategic accretive acquisitions.
Local Business Profile Generates Significant Cash Flow. Our local business profile allows us to generate significant recurring cash flow due to our diversified revenue base and high operating profit margins and maintain our low capital expenditure and working capital requirements. As a result of the Restructuring, which extinguished GateHouse’s obligations under the 2007 Credit Facility and certain interest rate swaps secured thereunder on November 6, 2013, the confirmation date of the Plan, our interest and debt servicing expenses are significantly lower than our Predecessor’s interest and debt servicing expenses. As of December 27, 2015, our debt structure consists of the New Media Credit Agreement and Advantage Credit Agreements (as defined below). We currently estimate that we will have significant free cash flow totaling $115.0 million to $135.0 million in 2016, which we believe will lead to stockholder value creation through our investments in organic growth, investments in accretive acquisitions and the return of cash to stockholders in the form of dividends, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. We further believe the strong cash flows generated and available to be invested will lead to consistent future dividend growth.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team is made up of executives who have an average of over 20 years of experience in the media industry, including strong traditional and digital media expertise. Our executive officers have broad industry experience with regard to both growing new digital business lines and identifying and integrating strategic acquisitions. Our management team also has key strengths in managing wide geographically disbursed teams, including the sales force, and identifying and centralizing duplicate functions across businesses leading to reduced core infrastructure costs.
Our Strategy
We intend to create stockholder value through a variety of factors including organic growth driven by our consumer and SMB strategies, pursuing attractive strategic acquisitions of high quality local media assets, and through the distribution of a substantial portion of our free cash flow as a dividend, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to accomplish any of these strategic initiatives.
A key component of our strategy is to acquire and operate traditional local media businesses and transform them from print-centric operations to dynamic multi-media operations through our existing online advertising and digital marketing services businesses. We will also leverage our existing platform to operate these businesses more efficiently. We believe all of these initiatives will lead to revenue and cash flow growth for New Media and will enable us to pay dividends to our stockholders. We intend to distribute a substantial portion of our free cash flow as a dividend to stockholders, through a quarterly dividend, subject to satisfactory financial performance, approval by our Board of Directors and dividend restrictions in the New Media Credit Agreement. The Board of Directors’ determinations regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s GAAP net income, free cash flow generated from operations or other sources, liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results. The key elements of our strategy include:
Maintain Our Leading Position in the Delivery of Proprietary Local Content in Our Communities. We seek to maintain our position as a leading provider of unique local content in the markets we serve and to leverage this position to 
8

strengthen our relationships with both readers and local businesses, thereby increasing penetration rates and market share. A critical aspect of this approach is to continue to provide local content that is not readily obtainable elsewhere and to be able to deliver that content to our customers across multiple print and digital platforms.
Grow Our New Digital Marketing Services Business. We plan to scale and expand our digital marketing services, including Propel. We believe Propel will allow us to sell digital marketing services to SMBs both in and outside existing New Media markets. The SMB demand for digital service solutions is great and represents a rapidly expanding opportunity. According to the 2011 U.S. Census data, there are approximately 27.9 million SMBs in the U.S. and, according to a 2015 U.S. Local Media Forecast by BIA/Kelsey, digital revenues are expected to grow to $42.6 billion in 2016, representing a 3.8% growth rate. Owners of SMBs often lack the resources and expertise to navigate the digital marketing services sector, with 49% of SMBs not having a website and 93% not having mobile-friendly websites according to a SCORE Association Small Business Study in 2014. We believe local SMBs will turn to our trusted local media brands to help them navigate through developing their digital marketing presence and strategy. We believe our local media properties and local sales infrastructure gives us a distinct advantage to being the leading local provider of digital marketing services, through Propel.
Pursue Strategic Accretive Acquisitions. We intend to capitalize on the highly fragmented and distressed local print industries which have greatly reduced valuation levels. We initially expect to focus our investments primarily in the local newspaper sector in small to mid-size markets. We believe we have a strong operational platform as well as scalable digital marketing services, including Propel. This platform, along with deep industry specific knowledge and experience that our management team has can be leveraged to reduce costs, stabilize the core business and grow digital revenues at acquired properties. The size and fragmentation of the addressable print media market place in the United States, the greatly reduced valuation levels that exist in these industries, and our deep experience make this an attractive place for our initial consolidation focus and capital allocation. Over the longer term we also believe there may be opportunity to diversify and acquire these types of assets internationally, as well as other traditional local media assets such as broadcast TV, out of home advertising (billboards) and radio, in the United States and internationally. We also believe there may be opportunities to acquire other strong businesses that have strong local brands and local sales infrastructure or digital product companies, both of which could quickly scale for Propel.
Stabilize Our Core Business Operations. We have four primary drivers in our strategic plans to stabilize our core business operations, including: (i) identifying permanent structural expense reductions in our traditional business cost infrastructure and re-deploying a portion of those costs toward future growth opportunities, primarily on the digital side of our business; (ii) accelerating the growth of both our digital audiences and revenues through improvements to current products, new product development, training, opportunistic changes in hiring to create an employee base with a more diversified skill set and sharing of best practices; (iii) accelerating our consumer revenue growth through subscription pricing increases, pay meters for digital content and growth in our overall subscriber base; and (iv) stabilizing our core print advertising revenues through improvements to pricing, packaging of products for customers that will produce the best results for them, and more technology and training for sales management and sales representatives.
The newspaper industry has experienced declining revenue and profitability over the past several years due to, among other things, advertisers’ shift from print to digital media following the consumer shift, and general market conditions. The Restructuring significantly reduced New Media’s interest expense. In addition, New Media intends to focus its business strategy on building its digital marketing business and growing its online advertising business, which we believe will offset some of the challenges experienced by GateHouse. With its improved capital structure and digital focus, combined with its strengths and strategy and dividend strategy, we believe that New Media will be able to grow stockholder value. However, there can be no assurance of this. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.
Challenges
We will likely face challenges commonly encountered by recently reorganized entities, including the risk that even under our improved capital structure, we may not be profitable.
As a publisher of locally based print and online media, we face a number of additional challenges, including the risks that:

• | the growing shift within the publishing industry from traditional print media to digital forms of publication may compromise our ability to generate sufficient advertising revenues;


• | investments in growing our digital business may not be successful, which could adversely affect our results of operations;


• | our advertising and circulation revenues may decline if we are unable to compete effectively with other companies in the local media industry; and

9


• | we may not be able to successfully acquire local print media assets at attractive valuations due to a rise in valuations from a more competitive landscape of acquirors.

For more information about New Media’s risks and challenges, see “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.

Directories
The core of our directory portfolio is comprised of the three yellow page directories, which are located in and around the Sacramento, California area, primarily in Roseville, California. The three directories have an aggregate circulation of approximately 348,000 and service Roseville, Auburn/Grass Valley/Nevada City and Folsom/El Dorado/Placerville, reaching four counties within the Sacramento region.
Our SureWest Directories portfolio is highlighted by the Roseville directory. The Roseville directory is the incumbent (with a circulation of approximately 210,000) and has served the local Roseville community for over 100 years and has achieved more than 50% market share.
We also own three additional directories including two Michigan and Indiana phone guides servicing St. Joseph county, Michigan and LaGrange county, Indiana, and Branch county, Michigan and Steuben county, Indiana, respectively, and one yellow page directory based in Mt. Shasta, California.
Propel Marketing
Propel is our digital marketing product line with digital products designed for SMBs. We believe the digital services industry represents a large and expanding opportunity. Propel is a product offering we created to attack that opportunity.
There are approximately 27.9 million SMBs in the United States today and about 26.7 million have less than 20 employees according to the 2011 U.S. Census data. Although these businesses are increasingly beginning to recognize the need to establish and maintain a strategy for the digital space, most do not have the time, expertise or resources to handle this themselves.
Propel is a product line that can become the outsourced digital marketing services department for those SMBs. Propel’s products help an SMB build a presence across digital platforms, help them get found by consumers, help them engage with and grow their customer base. We pull these products together for the SMB with a proprietary customer dashboard which integrates activity and results for all Propel products.
We also believe Propel gives us an opportunity to expand beyond our current geographic boundaries, as its product set could be of value to SMBs around the country.
Revenue
Our operations generate three primary types of revenue: (i) advertising, (ii) circulation (including home delivery subscriptions, single copy sales and digital subscriptions) and (iii) other (primarily commercial printing and digital marketing 
17

services). In 2015, these revenue streams accounted for approximately 58%, 32% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenue. The contribution of advertising, circulation and other revenue to our total revenue for New Media, known as the Successor Company for the years ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, two months ended December 29, 2013 and the Predecessor Company for the ten months ended November 6, 2013 was as follows:

 | Successor Company | | | Predecessor Company
 | Year EndedDecember 27, 2015 | | Year EndedDecember 28, 2014 | | Two Months EndedDecember 29, 2013 | | | Ten Months EndedNovember 6, 2013
(in thousands) | | | | | | | | 
Revenue: | | | | | | | | 
Advertising | $ | 696,696 | | | $ | 385,399 | | | $ | 63,340 | | $ | 265,078
Circulation | 378,263 | | | 195,661 | | | 29,525 | | | | 118,810
Commercial printing and other | 120,856 | | | 71,263 | | | 10,366 | | | | 29,402 
Total revenue | $ | 1,195,815 | | | $ | 652,323 | | | $ | 103,231 | | $ | 413,290

Advertising
Advertising revenue, which includes revenue generated from online and mobile products, is the largest component of our revenue, accounting for approximately 58%, 59% and 63% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We categorize advertising as follows:

• | Local Retail—local retailers, local stores for national retailers, grocers, drug stores, department and furniture stores, local financial institutions, niche shops, restaurants and other consumer related businesses.


• | Local Classified—local legal, obituaries, employment, automotive, real estate and other advertising.


• | Online—banner, display, classified, behavioral targeting, audience extension, search and other advertising on websites or mobile devices.


• | National—national and major accounts such as wireless communications companies, airlines and hotels, generally placed with us through agencies.

We believe that our advertising revenue tends to be less volatile than the advertising revenue of large metropolitan and national print media because we rely primarily on local, rather than national advertising and our classified revenue, tends to be more local market oriented (job listing for example). We generally derive 95% or more of our advertising revenue from local advertising (local retail, local classified and online) and less than 5% from national advertising. We believe that local advertising tends to be less sensitive to economic cycles than national advertising because local businesses generally have fewer effective advertising channels through which they may reach their customers.
Our advertising rate structures vary among our publications and are a function of various factors, including local market conditions, competition, circulation, readership and demographics. Management works with local newspaper management to set advertising rates and a portion of our publishers’ incentive compensation is based upon growing advertising revenue. Our sales compensation program emphasizes digital and new business growth. We share advertising concepts throughout our network of publishers and advertising directors including periodic special section programs, enabling them to utilize advertising products and sales strategies that are successful in other markets we serve.
Substantially all of our advertising revenue is derived from a diverse group of local retailers and local classified advertisers, resulting in very limited customer concentration. No single advertiser accounted for more than 1% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014 or 2013 and our 20 largest advertisers account for less than 10% of total revenue.
Our advertising revenue tends to follow a seasonal pattern, with higher advertising revenue in months containing significant events or holidays. Accordingly, our first quarter, followed by our third quarter, historically are our weakest quarters of the year in terms of revenue. Correspondingly, our second and fourth fiscal quarters, historically are our strongest quarters. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our advertising revenue in future periods.
We have experienced declines in advertising revenue over the past few years, due primarily to the secular pressures on the business as consumers and advertisers shift time and spend from traditional media to the internet. We continue to search for organic growth opportunities, specifically with digital advertising and ways to stabilize print revenue declines through strengthening local news product, value based pricing and training of sales staff.
18

Circulation
Our circulation revenue is derived from home delivery sales to subscribers, single copy sales at retail stores and vending racks and boxes, and digital subscriptions. We own 124 paid daily publications that range in circulation from approximately 300 to 116,000 and 213 paid weekly publications that range in circulation from approximately 100 to 12,000. Circulation revenue accounted for approximately 32%, 30% and 29% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Subscriptions are typically sold for three to twelve-month terms and often include promotions to extend the average subscription period or convert someone to become a subscriber. We also provide bundled print and digital subscriptions and employ pay meters for our website content at most of our daily publications. We implement marketing programs to increase readership through subscription and single copy sales, including company-wide and local circulation contests, direct mail programs, door-to-door sales and strategic alliances with local schools in the form of “Newspapers in Education” programs. In addition, since the adoption of the Telemarketing Sales Rule by the Federal Trade Commission in 2003, which created a national “do not call” registry, we have increased our use of “EZ Pay” programs, kiosks, sampling programs, in-paper promotions and online promotions to increase our circulation.
We encourage subscriber use of EZ Pay, a monthly credit card charge or direct bank debit payment program, which has led to higher retention rates for subscribers. We also use an active stop-loss program for all expiring subscribers. Additionally, in order to improve our circulation revenue and circulation trends, we periodically review the need for quality enhancements, such as:

• | Consumer research to better understand local content of interest;


• | Increasing the amount of unique hyper-local content;


• | Increasing the use of color and color photographs;


• | Improving graphic design, including complete redesigns;


• | Developing creative and interactive promotional campaigns;


• | Improving customer service and company wide customer retention efforts; and


• | Better use of demographic data to specifically target pricing and customer acquisition opportunities.

We believe that our unique and valuable hyper-local content allows us to continue to produce products of great relevance to our local market audiences. This allows us to be able to periodically raise prices, both for home delivery and on a single copy basis, resulting in increased circulation revenues. We also believe this unique hyper-local content will allow us to find ways to grow circulation revenues from our wide array of digital products.
Other
We provide commercial printing services to third parties on a competitive bid basis as a means to generate incremental revenue and utilize excess printing capacity. These customers consist primarily of other publishers that do not have their own printing presses and do not compete with our publications. We also print other commercial materials, including flyers, business cards and invitations. Additionally, this category includes Propel which provides internet marketing solutions for SMBs and GateHouse Live, our events business. Other sources of revenue, including commercial printing and Propel, accounted for approximately 10%, 11% and 8% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Printing and Distribution
We own and operate 57 print facilities. Our print facilities produce eight publications on average and are generally located within 60 miles of the communities served. By clustering our production resources or outsourcing where cost beneficial, we are able to reduce the operating costs of our publications while increasing the quality of our small and midsize market publications that would typically not otherwise have access to high quality production facilities. We also believe that we are able to reduce future capital expenditure needs by having fewer overall pressrooms and buildings. We believe our superior production quality is critical to maintaining and enhancing our position as the leading provider of local news coverage in the markets we serve. As other print media businesses look to reduce costs, we believe we have the opportunity to leverage our unutilized press time to grow our commercial print customer base and revenue.
The distribution of our daily newspapers is typically outsourced to independent, locally based, third-party distributors that also distribute a majority of our weekly newspapers and non-newspaper publications. We continuously evaluate lower cost options for newspaper delivery. In addition, certain of our shopper and weekly publications are delivered via the U.S. Postal Service.
19

Availability of Raw Materials for Our Business—Newsprint
The basic raw material for our publications is newsprint. We generally maintain only a 45 to 55-day inventory of newsprint.
Historically, the market price of newsprint has been volatile, reaching a high of approximately $823 per metric ton in 2008 and a low of $410 per metric ton in 2002. However, from 2010 to 2015, there was much less volatility in newsprint pricing and we have benefited from negotiating a fixed annual price for a majority of our newsprint. The average market price of newsprint during 2015 was approximately $585 per metric ton.
In 2014, we consumed approximately 57,300 metric tons of newsprint (inclusive of commercial printing) and the cost of our newsprint consumption totaled approximately $36.2 million. In contrast, in 2015, we consumed approximately 119,900 metric tons of newsprint (inclusive of commercial printing), and the cost of our newsprint consumption totaled approximately $66.9 million. Our newsprint expense typically averages less than 10% of total revenue, which we believe generally compares favorably to larger, metropolitan newspapers.
For our 2014 and 2015 purchases of newsprint, we negotiated a fixed price for approximately 95% and 93%, respectively, of our newsprint tons which allowed us to eliminate some of the volatility of the market price. We expect to purchase 93% of our newsprint with a fixed price again in 2016.
Competition
Each of our publications competes for advertising revenue to varying degrees with traditional media outlets such as direct mail, yellow pages, radio, outdoor advertising, broadcast and cable television, magazines, local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers and other print and online media sources, including local blogs. We also increasingly compete with new digital and social media companies for advertising revenue. However, we believe that barriers to entry remain high in many of the markets we serve in terms of being the preeminent source for local news and information therein, because our markets are generally not large enough to support a second newspaper and because our local news gathering infrastructures, sales networks and relationships would be time consuming and costly to replicate. We also have highly recognized local brand names and long histories in the towns we serve.
We also provide our readers with community-specific content, which is generally not available from other media sources. We believe that our direct and focused coverage of the market and our cost effective advertising rates relative to more broadly circulated metropolitan newspapers allow us to tailor an approach for our advertisers. As a result, our publications generally capture a large share of local advertising in the markets they serve.
The level of competition and the primary competitors we face vary from market to market. Competition tends to be based on market penetration, demographic and quality factors, as opposed to price factors. The competitive environment in each of our operating regions is discussed in greater detail below.
Eastern US Publishing. In Eastern US Publishing, the Boston Globe and boston.com, a metropolitan daily and website, respectively, owned by John Henry, compete with us throughout eastern Massachusetts. In addition, we compete in Massachusetts with companies that publish a combined total of approximately 16 dailies and 50 weeklies, three major radio station operators, five local network television broadcasters, one cable company and numerous niche publications for advertising revenues. We believe that our publications generally deliver the highest household coverage in their respective markets.
We believe our publications in these markets are generally the dominant media and that each has an audience far larger than the competitors. Daily newspapers owned by Gannett Company, Inc. (Poughkeepsie Journal in Poughkeepsie, New York) and 21st Century Media, Inc. (Daily Freeman in Kingston, New York), compete within the New York market. Our Cape Cod and New Bedford, Massachusetts newspapers experience competition from weekly newspapers, local radio stations, shopping guides, directories and niche publications.
Our publication, the Providence Journal, is the dominant daily newspaper in its market. Other daily newspaper operators in the state include the Edward Sherman Company, which owns the Newport Daily News and numerous non-dailies serving the Newport Rhode Island area and Sun Publishing Company, owner of the Westerly Sun and three non-dailies in the state. RISN Operations, Inc. publish four daily papers and five weekly publications serving communities in Providence county and Rhode Island. Three other companies publish more than 16 weeklies in Rhode Island. The Providence market has seven local network television stations and three major radio station operators, one cable company and numerous print and online niche publications.
20

Our publication The Gainesville Sun and Ocala Star Banner are the dominant media in their respective markets, primarily Alachua and Marion counties. We compete with four television stations, which is unusual for markets this size. Gainesville has its own DMA and Ocala falls into the Orlando DMA. There are no other dailies in the market other than a slow movement by the Villages Daily Sun into Marion county (Ocala), a concern due to their offering the lowest home delivery and single copy rates of any Florida daily. They operate as part of one of the fastest growing developments in the county, The Villages. We publish a weekly newspaper, Gainesville Guardian, in east Gainesville and also a very successful city magazine, Gainesville Magazine.
In the Daytona Beach market, our publication The Daytona Beach News-Journal is the dominant media. Primary print competition for the west side of our coverage area is the Orlando Sentinel, owned by Tribune Publishing. Smaller weekly competitive publications, including The Observer Group and Hometown News are also in the market. Major radio and network television stations are out of the Orlando market.
In the Sarasota market, we believe our publications are generally the dominant media and have an audience far larger than the competitors for the main areas we serve. Daily newspapers owned by McClatchy (Bradenton Herald) and Sun Coast Media Group (Charlotte Sun) border us on the north and south ends of our market respectively and distribute in our circulation area on the fringes. The Sarasota market has one local network television station and several local radio station operators and cable companies as well as numerous non-daily print and online niche publications.
Located in central Florida, our publication, The Ledger, in Lakeland is bordered by the Orlando Sentinel to the east and the Tampa Tribune to the west. In addition, our competitors also include multiple weekly newspapers and two radio stations. The Ledger is the dominant media in the central Florida area it serves.
In Tuscaloosa, the digital space is highly competitive with the competing site AL.com, owned by Advance Local.
Central US Publishing. Central US Publishing operates in 126 markets and we believe our publications are the dominant print advertising media in the vast majority of these markets. There are radio stations in or within 20 miles of every market in which we operate, but we do not believe that any of these radio station operators pose a significant competitive threat to our publications. Yellow page advertising is prevalent in all of our markets with either a local phone book or a regional phone book. We believe that, in most cases, yellow page advertising is geared more towards the professional services advertisers, such as attorneys and doctors, and not the local retail advertisers, as is the focus with our non-directory publications.
Lee Enterprises publishes the Southern Illinoisan in Carbondale, which is a regional newspaper that competes with our dailies in Marion, Benton, West Frankfort and DuQuoin. In all four of these cases, we believe our publications are the dominant local daily, but do compete on a regional basis with the larger dailies. We also compete with shoppers or weekly newspapers. This competition comes from small independent operators and is not significant. We have very little television competition in this group because of our geographic location in relation to major markets. There are no local television affiliates in our markets.
In the Northeast market of this group we believe our publications are generally the dominant media. The competition we face in this region is from major newspaper companies: daily newspapers owned by Gannett Company, Inc. (The Star-Gazette in Elmira, NY and the Chambersburg (PA) Public-Opinion); Times-Shamrock Company’s Scranton (PA) The Times-Tribune and Towanda Daily/Sunday Review; Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc.’s Sunbury Daily Item; and Ogden-Nutting’s Williamsport Sun-Gazette. We believe our publications tend to be the dominant local publication in those markets. In the Columbus market, the advertising competition in print is minimal with just a weekly business journal and a few small monthly magazines. On the electronic and digital side, the competition is intense comprised of six network TV stations, three cable companies, ten radio stations, and twelve digital agencies, with SMART 1 being the most aligned with our Propel product set.
In our Great Lakes markets we believe our publications are generally the dominant media in those markets. Our only significant competition comes from regional television stations in Adrian, Michigan. We also face competition from dozens of other competitors such as other local daily and weekly papers and niche publications, as well as radio and television stations, directories, direct mail and non-local internet websites, but none of these have proven to be significant.
Western US Publishing. In the southern regions of this group we believe our publications are generally the dominant media. Our major competition comes from regional daily newspapers, specifically: The Advocate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; The American Press in Lake Charles, Louisiana; The Joplin Globe; and the Wichita Eagle. The community newspapers operate generally in isolated markets where the American Consolidated Media newspapers are by far the leading sources of local news and print advertising. We also face competition from numerous other daily and weekly papers, local radio stations, shopping guides, directories and niche publications. In the Sherman, Texas market, we believe our publications are generally the dominant media in those markets with minor competition with The Dallas Morning News, which has minimal circulation, and it does not focus on coverage of local content. All weeklies in the Sherman, Texas market are controlled by us, though there is 
21

some weekly competition in outlying Texas and Oklahoma communities. Our publication, the Herald Democrat also competes with local TV stations and several locally-owned radio stations in the market.
In Arkansas, there is some minor competition from the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in northern Crawford county, AR, but they have limited circulation in the Fort Smith market, with some local news coverage. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette circulates in the market with our publication The Pine Bluff Commercial, but does not deliver the community coverage that is most relevant to Pine Bluff and the surrounding counties making our publication the most relevant news source in the area. There are several locally-owned radio stations in the market that compete with The Pine Bluff Commercial.
In the northern regions of this group, we control every local weekly and daily paper in Story county, Iowa and have weeklies in other neighboring counties, which is why we believe our publications are the dominant news source in the area. The principal print competition is the Des Moines Register, but it does not deliver meaningful local community content.
We face competition from other newspaper companies that include daily and weekly newspapers, local websites, local radio stations, local television stations, shopping guides, directories and niche publications. None of our competitors have proven to be significant. Our publications and websites have a rich history in our markets which we believe uniquely positions them for unmatched reach and relevancy in their local audiences.
Employees
As of December 27, 2015, we employed 9,509 employees. We employ union personnel at a number of our core publications representing 1,236 employees. As of December 27, 2015, there were 35 collective bargaining agreements covering union personnel. Most of our unionized employees work under collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2017. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good and we have had no work stoppages at any of our publications.
Environmental Matters
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of our employees based upon existing facts presently known to us. Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other related activities has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our operations, but has, since the incorporation of our Predecessor in 1997, been accomplished without having a material adverse effect on its operations. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations and technology, based on information currently known to us and insurance procured with respect to certain environmental matters, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to be material or to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Our operations involve risks in these areas, however, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us.
