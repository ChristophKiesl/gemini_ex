ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview of Our Sharing Economy Business



Our business focuses on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses. We believe a true peer-to-peer sharing economy based on rentals will take significant market share in both the business and consumer markets over the next few years. 



Sharing economy business models are hosted through digital platforms that enable more precise, real-time measurement of spare capacity and have the ability to dynamically connect that capacity with those who need it. These digital platforms handle transactions that offer access over ownership through renting, lending, subscribing, reselling, swapping or donating. Consumers who use sharing economy business models are often more comfortable with transactions that involve deeper social interactions than traditional methods of exchange.



With the market situation of the global sharing economy markets, we continued to pursue what we believe are high growth opportunities for the Company, particularly our new business divisions focused on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses within the company. These initiatives are still in an early stage and are dependent in large part on availability of capital to fund their future growth. We did not generate significant revenues from our sharing economy business initiatives in 2021. COVID-19 has continued to cause the global consumer behavior changes in 2021, which affects P2P sharing development. While the world is implanting vaccination for COVID-19, we believe P2P sharing activities will resume to normal activity level during the second half of 2022.



Listing Status



On November 26, 2018, we received a staff determination notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) informing the Company that as a result of its failure to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5635(c) (the “Rule”), the staff determined to deny the Company’s request for continued listing based on a plan of compliance submitted on October 26, 2018. Our common stock was delisted from Nasdaq at the open of trading on December 5, 2018. Our common stock is currently trading on the OTC Markets under the symbol “SEII.”
Our Corporate History and Background



We are a Nevada corporation. We were incorporated in Delaware on June 24, 1987, under the name Malex, Inc. We changed our corporate name to China Wind Systems, Inc. on December 18, 2007. On June 13, 2011, we changed our corporate name to Cleantech Solutions International, Inc. On August 7, 2012, we were converted into a Nevada corporation. On January 8, 2018, we changed our name to Sharing Economy International Inc. 



Beginning in the second quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018, we established new business divisions to focus on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses. We believe a true peer-to-peer sharing economy based on rentals will take significant market share in both the business and consumer markets over the next few years.

While we are retaining our Sharing Economy business, our primary business has changed, with the acquisition of the Peak Equity business.



Reverse Acquisition of Peak Equity



On December 27, 2019, Sharing Economy International Inc. entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), by and among the Company, Peak Equity International Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Peak Equity”), and all of the holders of ordinary shares of Peak Equity, which consisted of three shareholders.



Under the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company offered, sold and issued 7,200,000,000 shares of common stock in consideration for all the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Peak Equity. The effect of the issuance is that Peak Equity shareholders now hold approximately 99.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 



Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 200,000,000 of common stock. The Company is still obligated to issue an additional 7,018,360,787 shares of common stock to the Peak Equity shareholders, and plans to amend its Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to increase its number of authorized shares of common stock for such purpose.  Assuming the issuance of such additional 7,018,360,787 shares of common stock to the Peak Equity shareholders, the Peak Equity shareholders will hold approximately 99.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

None of our officers or directors have resigned in connection with the acquisition of the Peak Equity business.



As a result of the share exchange Peak Equity is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 



The transactions consummated with Peak Equity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement were treated as a reverse acquisition, with Peak Equity as the acquiror and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Form 8-K to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of Peak Equity.

We are not a Hong Kong operating company but a Nevada holding company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in Hong Kong and PRC. This structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries and will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Sharing Economy International Inc. and its Hong Kong and PRC subsidiaries are not required to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, or Cybersecurity Administration Committee, or CAC, to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. However, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we (the parent company and our subsidiaries) may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard including the risk that we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, that applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approvals in the future, or that the PRC government could disallow our holding company structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions would likely cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong and PRC.”

Description of Business 



We have developed and operated an online rental classified platform named ECrent.com, which provides a marketplace for individuals and companies to view, list and search for rental products and services.



Our mission is to become the largest, most extensive sharing economy network, allowing individuals and companies to view, list and search for rental products and services on the platform, creating the conditions for collaborative consumption. Collaborative consumption is the trigger for more sustainable business and consumer practices that will protect the planet’s well-being as well as generate an entire class of new business opportunities based on the sharing economy ecosystem.



Our model is designed to bring sustainability, entrepreneurship and sharing together.



We operate an online platform, www.ecrent.com, which connects owners (businesses and individuals) and consumers in a robust growing community. The platform consists of a set of web portals and mobile applications which facilitate the online search for a wide and expanding range of rental products and services. The ECrent platform is designed to enable members of the rapidly growing global community to seek and rent items everywhere worldwide. The highly scalable ECrent platform is designed to consolidate all sharing and rental information (supply side) from all geographies into one single source, across multiple categories, and then rebroadcast available rental supply to the demand side. The ECremt platform is coded using advanced algorithms which leverage the central database to provide greater convenience to users through an intelligent matching system. The intelligent matching system incorporates specific product and/or service criteria, product/service pairings, geography and browsing behaviors. ECrent believes these features form the basis for a more comprehensive and extensive user experience than is otherwise available from well-known, first generation, single purpose sharing economy businesses such as Uber and Airbnb.

After proof of concept by our ECrent Worldwide in other markets, notably Asia and selected regions of Europe, we started operations in the United States in mid-spring 2016 after obtaining a license to use our ECrent Worldwide’s software and trademark. Among the most significant findings, we learned that companies across all segments covet highly targeted and active markets, which historically were believed to generate a greater rate of investment. We believe the demand side is and will be dominated by environmentally and socially conscious users, which will be considered a targeted and active market that will make the platform more attractive and valuable.



PwC’s accompanying survey showed that 44% of U.S. adults are familiar with the sharing economy; 18% of U.S. adults say they have participated in the sharing economy as a consumer; and 7% say they have participated as a provider. Based on the PwC research, the global sharing and rental market would generate a potential revenue opportunity worth a total of $670 billion by 2025.



We believe ECrent is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends, and the groundwork has laid in the course of the soft launch will help to achieve the goal to lead the sharing economy development. While the traditional purchase-based consumer discretionary companies have mostly utilitarian relationships with their customers, sharing economy participants are passionate about social responsibility, environmentalism and are committed to leading more sustainable lives. This commitment, fortified by continued momentum, will allow us to build a more captive, engaged, true community of users.



The ECrent extensive and scalable platform is engineered to serve the business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and consumer-to-consumer market segments. By covering across these multiple segments positions ECrent for balanced growth regardless of macro-economic conditions as we will not rely on a single market. We envision the strategy will also provide us with ample opportunity to further lead the market by regularly introducing new features, functions, categories, and pricing.



We believe businesses will find the ECrent platform highly appealing because it will allow them to monetize unused or little used assets as well as expand their business by opening up new channels created by the sharing economy. In addition, we believe their affiliation with us will allow these companies to reinforce their brand to consumers and investors. A study published by MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group in May 2016 (the “MIT BCG Study”) found that 60% of investment firm board members are willing to divest from companies with poor sustainability performance and 75% feel increased operational efficiency often accompanies sustainability progress. By contrast, this same study revealed that only 60% of the 3,000 executives and managers surveyed have a sustainability strategy in place, while only 25% can present a clear sustainability business case. We believe the ECrent platform will be a highly cost effective vehicle for closing this significant gap between companies and the markets they serve as well as their investors on the basis that our fully branded microsite will provide a cost-effective vehicle for them to develop and implement improved sustainability performance to meet the needs of sustainability conscious investors, notably building awareness and focus on tangible and measureable sustainability (business) outcomes.



The ECrent revenue model is to charge only the supply side; demand side registrants are not subject to any fee in the present model. Businesses or individuals can either pay to post a single item or service just as they would for a classified ad or they can post an unlimited number of items as well as brand themselves through an online rental store (microsite) on the ECrent platform. Microsites represent a recurring revenue model, offering a value proposition beyond renting items to other businesses or individuals. The MIT/BCG Study included steps business leaders could take to meet the needs of sustainability-conscious investors, notably building greater awareness and focus on tangible and measurable sustainability (business) outcomes. We believe the ECrent platform will be an ideal cost-effective vehicle for meeting these objectives.



The ECrent business is an emerging company in an emerging field. Accordingly, the approach to the market seeks to exploit early market entry opportunities in the sharing economy with a sense-and-respond strategy within our growing community. In the second fully operational phase we will employ both in-house sales professionals and engage market channel partners to solicit business from supply side. We will also build a team of Community Relations specialists who will cultivate tight relationships with users for by soliciting user feedback for ongoing improvements to the platform and expansion. We believe aggressive marketing and strategic partnerships with various agencies, such as marketing firms and trade associations will further propel our business once fully operational.

Revenue and User Model



ECrent revenue will be derived from online item postings. We do not charge any fees based on transaction value nor do we plan to do so in the near future. Set forth below is the current listing fee arrangements, which fees are to be paid prior to posting:

1. | A monthly fee of HK$50,000 for the advertisement posting (unlimited basis); and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Online rental stores, or microsite for $2,500 per year.
---+--------------------------------------------------------




The microsite is an enhanced online advertising package that allows for unlimited number of postings for a defined period of time, and a personalized online web storefront, providing customers with unique branding opportunities. We believe our microsites will represent a recurring revenue model as it will not be cost effective for the users to terminate our services once they have expended efforts to design and promote their microsites and they have received reoccurring traffic from their customers.

Business Licenses



We believe our sharing economy businesses are properly licensed with the appropriate government entities.



Employment Ordinance



Hong Kong



The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong since 1968. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holidays with Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract, Protection Against Anti-Union Discrimination. In addition, every employer must take out employees’ compensation insurance to protect the claims made by employees in respect of accidents occurred during the course of their employment.



An employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (CAP485). These include enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employer should enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries. Pursuant to the said Ordinance, we are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period within 1 month). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels are HK$7,100 and HK$30,000 respectively.

Depending upon the political climate, we may also become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire PRC companies, or make dividend payments to SEII.



PRC Regulations on Tax



Enterprise Income Tax



The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “EIT Law”) was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was later amended on February 24, 2017. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the “Implementation Rules”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%.



The Arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the “Arrangement”) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on August 21, 2006 and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. The Notice on the Understanding and Identification of the Beneficial Owners in the Tax Treaty (the “Notice”) was promulgated by SAT and became effective on October 27, 2009. According to the Notice, a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a substance-over-form principle to determine whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.

In April 2009, the Ministry of Finance, or MOF, and SAT jointly issued the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59. In December 2009, SAT issued the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular 698 became effective retroactively as of January 2008. In February 2011, SAT issued the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 24, effective April 2011. By promulgating and implementing these circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-resident enterprise.



Under Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the equity interests of a PRC “resident enterprise” indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.



In February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.



On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued a Notice Concerning Withholding Income Tax of Non-Resident Enterprise, or SAT Notice No. 37, which abolishes Circular 698 and certain provisions of Circular 7. SAT Notice No. 37 reduces the burden of the withholding obligator, such as revocation of contract filing requirements and tax liquidation procedures, strengthens the cooperation of tax authorities in different places, and clarifies the calculation of tax payable and mechanism of foreign exchange.



Value-added Tax



Pursuant to the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, or the VAT Regulations, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, took effect on January 1, 1994, and were amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016, and November 19, 2017, respectively, and the Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, which were promulgated by the MOF on December 25, 1993, and were amended on December 15, 2008, and October 28, 2011, respectively, entities and individuals that sell goods or labor services of processing, repair or replacement, sell services, intangible assets, or immovables, or import goods within the territory of the People’s Republic of China are taxpayers of value-added tax. The VAT rate is 17% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 11% for taxpayers selling services of transportation, postal, basic telecommunications, construction and lease of immovable, selling immovable, transferring land use rights, selling and importing other specified goods including fertilizers; 6% for taxpayers selling services or intangible assets.



According to the Notice on the Adjustment to the Value-added Tax Rates issued by the SAT and the MOF on April 4, 2018, where taxpayers make VAT taxable sales or import goods, the applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 17% to 16% and from 11% to 10%, respectively. Subsequently, the Notice on Policies for Deepening Reform of Value-added Tax was issued by the SAT, the MOF and the General Administration of Customs on March 30, 2019 and took effective on April 1, 2019, which further adjusted the applicable tax rate for taxpayers making VAT taxable sales or importing goods. The applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 16% to 13% and from 10% to 9%, respectively.

Dividend Withholding Tax



The Enterprise Income Tax Law provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.



PRC Laws and Regulations on Employment and Social Welfare



Labor Law of the PRC



Pursuant to the Labor Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on July 5, 1994 with an effective date of January 1, 1995 and was last amended on August 27, 2009 and the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, which was promulgated on June 29, 2007, became effective on January 1, 2008 and was last amended on December 28, 2012, with the amendments coming into effect on July 1, 2013, enterprises and institutions shall ensure the safety and hygiene of a workplace, strictly comply with applicable rules and standards on workplace safety and hygiene in China, and educate employees on such rules and standards. Furthermore, employers and employees shall enter into written employment contracts to establish their employment relationships. Employers are required to inform their employees about their job responsibilities, working conditions, occupational hazards, remuneration and other matters with which the employees may be concerned. Employers shall pay remuneration to employees on time and in full accordance with the commitments set forth in their employment contracts and with the relevant PRC laws and regulations. Our Hong Kong subsidiary currently does not comply with PRC laws and regulations, but complies with Hong Kong laws and regulations.



Social Insurance and Housing Fund



Pursuant to the Social Insurance Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on October 28, 2010 and became effective on July 1, 2011, employers in the PRC shall provide their employees with welfare schemes covering basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, and occupational injury insurance. Our Hong Kong subsidiary has not deposited the social insurance fees in full for all the employees in compliance with the relevant regulations. We may be ordered by the social security premium collection agency to make or supplement contributions within a stipulated period, and shall be subject to a late payment fine computed from the due date at the rate of 0.05% per day; where payment is not made within the stipulated period, the relevant administrative authorities shall impose a fine ranging from one to three times the amount of the amount in arrears. Our Hong Kong subsidiary has not deposited the social insurance fees as required by relevant regulations.



In accordance with the Regulations on Management of Housing Provident Fund, which were promulgated by the State Council on April 3, 1999 and last amended on March 24, 2002, employers must register at the designated administrative centers and open bank accounts for depositing employees’ housing funds. Employers and employees are also required to pay and deposit housing funds, with an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year in full and on time. Our subsidiaries have not registered at the designated administrative centers nor opened bank accounts for depositing employees’ housing funds. They also have not deposited employees’ housing funds. Our subsidiaries may be ordered by the housing provident fund management center to complete the registration formalities, open bank accounts, make the payment and deposit within a prescribed time limit if they become subject to PRC laws. Failing to register or open bank accounts at the expiration of the time limit could result in fines of not less than RMB10,000 nor more than RMB50,000. And an application may be made to a people’s court for compulsory enforcement if payment and deposit has not been made after the expiration of the time limit.

PRC Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange 



General Administration of Foreign Exchange



The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC is the Administrative Regulations of the PRC on Foreign Exchange (the “Foreign Exchange Regulations”), which were promulgated on January 29, 1996, became effective on April 1, 1996 and were last amended on August 5, 2008. Under these rules, Renminbi is generally freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments, but not freely convertible for capital account items, such as capital transfer, direct investment, investment in securities, derivative products or loans unless prior approval by competent authorities for the administration of foreign exchange is obtained. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE to pay dividends by providing certain evidentiary documents, including board resolutions, tax certificates, or for trade- and services-related foreign exchange transactions, by providing commercial documents evidencing such transactions.
Circular No. 37 and Circular No. 13



Circular 37 was released by SAFE on July 4, 2014 and abolished Circular 75 which had been in effect since November 1, 2005. Pursuant to Circular 37, a PRC resident should apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of overseas investments before it makes any capital contribution to a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests. SPVs are offshore enterprises directly established or indirectly controlled by domestic residents for the purpose of investment and financing by utilizing domestic or offshore assets or interests they legally hold. Following any significant change in a registered offshore SPV, such as capital increase, reduction, equity transfer or swap, consolidation or division involving domestic resident individuals, the domestic individuals shall amend the registration with SAFE. Where an SPV intends to repatriate funds raised after completion of offshore financing to the PRC, it shall comply with relevant PRC regulations on foreign investment and foreign debt management. A foreign-invested enterprise established through return investment shall complete relevant foreign exchange registration formalities in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange administration regulations on foreign direct investment and truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of its shareholders.



If any shareholder who is a PRC resident (as determined by the Circular No. 37) holds any interest in an offshore SPV and fails to fulfil the required foreign exchange registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and dividends to their offshore parent company or from carrying out other subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. The offshore SPV may also be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Where a domestic resident fails to complete relevant foreign exchange registration as required, fails to truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of the enterprise involved in the return investment or otherwise makes false statements, the foreign exchange control authority may order them to take remedial actions, issue a warning, and impose a fine of less than RMB 300,000 on an institution or less than RMB 50,000 on an individual.



Circular 13 was issued by SAFE on February 13, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to Circular 13, a domestic resident who makes a capital contribution to an SPV using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests is no longer required to apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of his or her overseas investments. Instead, he or she shall register with a bank in the place where the assets or interests of the domestic enterprise in which he or she has interests are located if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate domestic assets or interests; or he or she shall register with a local bank at his or her permanent residence if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate offshore assets or interests.



We cannot assure that our PRC beneficial shareholders have completed registrations in accordance with Circular 37.



Circular 19 and Circular 16



Circular 19 was promulgated by SAFE on March 30, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises, meaning the monetary contribution confirmed by the foreign exchange authorities or the monetary contribution registered for account entry through banks, shall be granted the benefits of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement (“Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement”). With Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement, foreign capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution have been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau, or for which book-entry registration of monetary contribution has been completed by the bank, can be settled at the bank based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The allowed Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement percentage of the foreign capital of a foreign-invested enterprise has been temporarily set to be 100%. The Renminbi converted from the foreign capital will be kept in a designated account and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make any further payment from such account, it will still need to provide supporting documents and to complete the review process with its bank.

Furthermore, Circular 19 stipulates that foreign-invested enterprises shall make bona fide use of their capital for their own needs within their business scopes. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and the Renminbi it obtained from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for the following purposes:




● | directly or indirectly used for expenses beyond its business scope or prohibited by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for investment in securities unless otherwise provided by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for entrusted loan in Renminbi (unless within its permitted scope of business), repayment of inter-company loans (including advances by a third party) or repayment of bank loans in Renminbi that have been sub-lent to a third party; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Circular 16 was issued by SAFE on June 9, 2016. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to Renminbi on a self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange capital items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis applicable to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that an enterprise’s Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency-denominated capital may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or purposes prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted Renminbi capital shall not be provided as loans to non-affiliated entities.



Our PRC subsidiary’s distributions to their offshore parents are required to comply with the requirements as described above.



PRC Share Option Rules



Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.



PRC Regulation of Dividend Distributions



The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distributions by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, the Chinese-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations, and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside a general reserve of at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
