ITEM 1.— BUSINESS
The Company operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, IWCO Direct Holdings, Inc. ("IWCO Direct" or "Direct Marketing") and ModusLink Corporation ("ModusLink" or "Supply Chain"). The Company previously operated under the names ModusLink Global Solutions, Inc., CMGI, Inc., and CMG Information Services, Inc. and was incorporated in Delaware in 1986.
IWCO Direct is a leading provider of data-driven marketing solutions, driving response across all marketing channels and measurable improvements to its customers’ return on marketing investment. With a more than 50-year legacy of printing and mailing services, IWCO Direct's full range of expanded marketing services includes strategy, creative services, and execution for omnichannel marketing campaigns, along with one of the industry's most sophisticated postal logistics strategies for direct mail. Through Mail-Gard®, IWCO Direct offers business continuity and disaster recovery services to protect against unexpected business interruptions, along with providing print and mail outsourcing services. IWCO Direct's services include: (a) development of direct mail and omnichannel marketing strategies, (b) creative services to design direct mail, email, and online marketing, (c) printing and compiling of direct mail pieces into envelopes ready for mailing, (d) commingling services to sort mail produced for various customers by destination to achieve optimized postal savings, and (e) business continuity and disaster recovery services for critical communications to protect against unexpected business interruptions. The major markets served by IWCO Direct include financial services, multiple-system operators ("MSO") (cable or direct-broadcast satellite TV systems), insurance, as well as subscription/services, healthcare, travel/hospitality, retail, not-for-profit, and others. Direct mail is a critical piece of marketing for most of IWCO Direct’s clients, who use direct mail to acquire new customers, deepen the sales cycle, and maintain customer loyalty. Management believes that direct mail will remain an important part of its customers' strategy for the foreseeable future, based on its proven ability to enhance results when used as part of an omnichannel marketing strategy. 
On June 2, 2021, the Board approved a Competitive Improvement Plan (“CIP”) for IWCO Direct, which addresses the changing requirements of its customers and markets it serves, as well as the current competitive landscape. The CIP seeks to expand IWCO Direct’s marketing services capabilities, and upgrade its production platform to new digital and inserting technology, while reducing its overall production costs to enhance its competitive pricing capabilities. The CIP contemplates a 
total investment of approximately $54 million primarily over a 24-month period. The Company estimates the CIP cost will consist of approximately: (1) $38 million for digital press and insertion equipment, and technology build out cost (of which approximately $34 million in lease/purchase agreements were entered into subsequent to year-end), and (2) $16 million for severance, employee retention, facilities optimization, and other implementation costs. In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $12 million for non-cash accelerated depreciation expense. The cost estimates do not include amounts for potential non-cash asset impairment charges relating to facilities and equipment optimization. The timing and amount of the costs will depend on a number of factors.

Steel Holdings Expression of Interest
On November 19, 2020, the Company's Board received a preliminary, non-binding expression of interest from Steel Holdings to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock not already owned by Steel Holdings or its affiliates for a combination of cash and Steel Holdings 6% Series A Preferred Units, which would imply a value per share of common stock in the range of $0.65 to $0.72 per share.
The transaction, as proposed, is subject to negotiation. Any definitive agreement with respect to such transaction is subject to approval by the board of directors of Steel Holdings, the Board and shareholders. Such definitive agreement would be expected to contain customary closing conditions, including standard regulatory notifications and approvals.
As a result, we cannot predict whether the terms of such transaction will be agreed upon by Steel Holdings and the Board's special committee for recommendation to their respective boards of directors, for approval of the transaction or whether any such transactions would be approved by the requisite votes of our shareholders.
We also cannot predict the timing, final structure or other terms of any potential transaction and the terms of any such transaction may differ materially from those originally proposed by Steel Holdings. The pendency of any such proposed transaction may have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, we expect to incur a number of non-recurring, transaction-related costs associated with negotiating the proposed transaction.

Reportable Segments
The Company has determined that it has two reportable segments: Direct Marketing and Supply Chain. The Company also has Corporate-level activity, which consists primarily of costs associated with certain corporate administrative functions such as legal, finance, share-based compensation and acquisition costs which are not allocated to the Company's reportable segments. The Corporate-level balance sheet information includes cash and cash equivalents, notes payables, and other assets and liabilities, which are not identifiable to the operations of the Company's reportable segments. Certain reportable segment information, including revenue, profit (loss) and asset information, is set forth in Note 21 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 below and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Item 7 below.
Technology Infrastructure
IWCO Direct has dual redundant data centers located in our Minnesota and Pennsylvania locations. These data centers have been architected to provide full resiliency and security to enable IWCO Direct optimal and always-on computing resources to support its enterprise business applications and complex data processing required by its customers. IWCO Direct's information security practice is audited and certified annually against ISO-27001, HiTrust, PCI and HIPAA controls and standards. IWCO Direct has fully integrated and enterprise class business systems including an industry specific enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system that has been customized to support IWCO Direct's unique business flows. These business

ModusLink's information technology systems and infrastructure serve as the backbone of a client's fully integrated global supply chain services and manages the flow and use of physical assets and information. ModusLink offers a secure and redundant operating environment to ensure the integrity and privacy of its clients' data.

ModusLink's ERP system is designed to provide the visibility and control needed for better decision making, rapid response to global market dynamics and effective asset utilization across services and geographies.
Competition
The market for the range of services offered by IWCO Direct is highly competitive and fragmented. IWCO Direct's scope and scale of end-to-end services provides a competitive advantage by being able to focus on efficiency while making the end product more effective in driving response for clients. While the ability to offer a more effective marketing product is highly valued, we must continue to provide it at a competitive price and aggressively manage our cost structure to maintain our client roster and attract new business.
Competitors for our print/mail products and services include printers, envelope manufacturers and commercial lettershops (i.e., mail service providers). Competitors for our Marketing Services practice include internal and external agencies and data analytics companies.
The market for the supply chain management service offerings provided by ModusLink is highly competitive. As a provider with service offerings covering a range of supply chain operations and activities across the globe, ModusLink competes with different companies depending on the type of service it is providing or the geographic area in which an activity is taking place. ModusLink faces competition from Electronics Manufacturing Services/Contract Manufacturers (EMS/CM), third party logistics (3PL) providers, Supply Chain Management (SCM) companies and regional specialty companies. For certain digital commerce services, ModusLink's competition includes global outsource providers, software as service (SaaS) providers, technology providers and computer software providers offering content and document management solutions. As a provider of an outsourcing solution, ModusLink's competition also includes current and prospective clients, who evaluate ModusLink's capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are quality and range of solutions and services, technological capabilities, costs, location of facilities, responsiveness and adaptability. With ModusLink's set of supply chain services, global footprint, strong client service acumen and its integrated global supply chain digital commerce services, the Company believes that it is well positioned to compete in each of the markets it serves, while expanding across various industry subsets. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry—Our business is subject to intense competition.” For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry—Our business is subject to intense competition.”
Clients
A limited number of clients account for a significant percentage of the Company's consolidated net revenue. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 52% and 57% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. One client, associated with the Supply Chain segment, accounted for 16% and 17% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021and 2020, respectively. Another client, associated with the Direct Marketing segment, accounted for approximately 11% and 8% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021and 2020, respectively. No other clients accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. In general, the Company does not have many agreements which obligate any client to buy a material amount of services from the Company, or which designate the Company as its sole supplier of any particular services. The Company sells its services to its clients primarily on a purchase order basis, which is subject to demand variability. As such, the loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes that it will continue to derive a majority of its consolidated operating revenue from sales to a small number of clients. 
There can be no assurance that revenue from key clients will not decline in future periods.
Resources

The primary raw materials we use in our Direct Marketing business are paper and ink. At this time, Direct Marketing’s supply of raw materials is readily available from numerous vendors; however, based on market conditions that could change in the future. We negotiate with leading suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies. Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades and ink formulations used in our production processes may affect our consolidated financial results. Paper prices have fluctuated over the past few years and we expect continued volatility in the foreseeable future. Direct Marketing is generally able to pass along most increases in cost through to its clients although in many cases there is a delay based on terms within individual client contracts. We believe contractual arrangements and industry practice will support our continued ability to pass on all future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so. We believe that there may be future shortfalls of the supplies necessary to meet the demands of the entire marketplace. Higher paper prices and limited paper supplies may have an impact on fulfilling clients’ demand for printed products. We have undertaken various strategic initiatives to mitigate any foreseeable supply disruptions with respect to our paper requirements.
The Company purchases and maintains adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs on a timely basis. The Company has no guaranteed price, quantity or delivery agreements with its suppliers. Because of the diversity of its services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of its facilities, the Company uses numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for its operations. 
The Company relies upon a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. From time to time, we develop new trade secrets and other intellectual property or obtain intellectual property through acquisition activities. Our businesses are not substantially dependent on any single or group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses.
International Operations
In addition to its North American operations, Supply Chain conducts business in several countries, including Mainland China, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Ireland and Singapore, among others. IWCO Direct does not currently have international operations. During the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues from our foreign operations accounted for approximately 27% and 33% of total revenues, respectively.
The Company's international operations increase its exposure to U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and labor practices, which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes with which the Company must comply. A substantial portion of our international business is conducted in Mainland China, where we face (i) the challenge of navigating a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting the conduct of business in Mainland China by foreign companies, (ii) potential limitations on the repatriation of cash, (iii) and foreign currency fluctuation. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry—The Supply Chain business conducts business outside of the U.S., which may expose the Company to additional risks not typically associated with companies that operate solely in the U.S.”
Human Capital Management
Steel Connect’s approximately 3,120 employees worldwide represent our most important asset. We are committed to creating workplace environments that are ethical, diverse, inclusive, and just, which go beyond simply complying with workplace laws. 
Human capital management is a key driver of the Company's success, and we are committed to a work environment in which everyone is treated fairly with dignity and respect. This is supported by our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which establishes the baseline requirements of our integrity and compliance program. Our core values are Teamwork, Respect, Integrity and Commitment. By embracing these core values, the Company strives to create an environment where its employees can all be productive, innovative and true to themselves. 
The following programs are crucial to support and work to improve the Company's workplace environment:

leave), veteran status, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by law. Management is committed to promoting from within when the opportunity is right for the employee and the Company.

•Steel Environmental Health and Safety Council: The Steel Environmental Health and Safety Council is comprised of the health and safety teams at the Company's affiliate companies and representatives from the legal and human resources departments who are dedicated to the safety of our people.
Employee Safety and Well Being
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses worldwide, and the Company continues to take actions to ensure its employees' health and safety. Many of our office workers continue to telecommute; however, where our workers continue at our facilities, the Company has established a number of safety protocols as situations and local requirements dictate. Our COVID-19 Task Force meets regularly to share good practices and create risk mitigation plans and resource guides to safeguard our employees and their families.
