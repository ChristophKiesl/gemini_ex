We offer our solutions to a wide range of clients across the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals. The quality and breadth of our solutions contribute to the long-standing nature of our relationships with our clients, the majority of whom enter into long-term contracts across multiple products that are embedded in their mission-critical workflow and decision processes, particularly in the Software Solutions segment. Given the contractual nature of our revenues and stickiness of our client relationships, our revenues are highly visible and recurring in nature. Due to our integrated suite of solutions and our scale, we are able to drive significant operating leverage, which we believe enables our clients to operate more efficiently while allowing us to generate strong margins and cash flows.
Our Markets
The U.S. mortgage loan market is large, and the loan lifecycle is complex and consists of several stages. The mortgage loan lifecycle includes origination, servicing and default. Mortgage loans are originated to finance home purchases or refinance existing mortgage loans. Once a mortgage loan is originated, it is serviced on a periodic basis by mortgage loan servicers, which may not be the lenders that originated the mortgage loan. Furthermore, if a mortgage loan experiences default, it triggers a set of multifaceted processes with an assortment of potential outcomes depending on a mix of variables.
Underlying the three major components of the mortgage loan lifecycle are the software, data and analytics support behind each process, which have become increasingly critical to industry participants due to the complexity of regulatory requirements. As the industry has grown in complexity, participants have responded by outsourcing to large scale specialty providers, automating manual processes and seeking end-to-end solutions that support the processes required to manage the entire mortgage loan lifecycle.
Overview of the Markets We Serve
The U.S. mortgage loan servicing market is comprised of first and second lien mortgage loans. Even through housing downturns, the mortgage loan servicing market generally remains stable, as the total number of first lien mortgage loans outstanding tends to stay relatively constant. The number of second lien mortgage loans outstanding can vary based on a number of factors including loan-to-value ratios, interest rates and lenders' desire to own such loans.
While delinquent mortgage loans typically represent a small portion of the overall mortgage loan servicing market, the mortgage loan default process is long and complex and involves multiple parties, a significant exchange of data and documentation and extensive regulatory requirements. Providers in the default process must be able to meet strict regulatory guidelines, which we believe are best met through the use of proven technology.
The U.S. mortgage loan origination market consists of both purchase and refinance mortgage loan originations. The mortgage loan origination process is complex and involves multiple parties, significant data exchange and significant regulatory oversight, which requires a comprehensive, scalable solution developed by a company with substantial industry experience. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association ("MBA"), Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") the U.S. mortgage loan origination market for purchase and refinance mortgage loan originations was estimated as follows (in billions):

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Mortgage loan originations: | | | | | 
Purchase | $ | 1,424.0 | | | $ | 1,272.0 | | $ | 1,185.0
Refinance | 2,268.0 | | | 796.0 | | | 458.0
Total - MBA(1) | $ | 3,692.0 | | | $ | 2,068.0 | | $ | 1,643.0
Purchase | $ | 1,605.0 | | | $ | 1,326.0 | | $ | 1,234.0
Refinance | 2,806.0 | | | 1,136.0 | | | 532.0

Market Trends
Market trends that have spurred lenders and servicers to seek software, data and analytics solutions are as follows:
Integral role of technology in the U.S. mortgage loan industry. Over the past few years, the homebuyer’s processes have become more digital and banks and other lenders and servicers have become increasingly focused on automation and workflow management to operate more efficiently and meet their regulatory requirements as well as using technology to enhance the consumer experience during the mortgage loan origination, closing and servicing processes. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our clients have become increasingly aware that digital solutions are integral to their ability to stay connected with their customer base in times when face-to-face interactions are not possible. We believe technology providers must be able to support the complexity and dynamic nature of the market, display extensive industry knowledge and possess the financial resources to make the necessary investments in technology and software to support lenders. This includes an enhanced digital experience along with the application of artificial intelligence, robotic process automation and adaptive learning.
Heightened demand for enhanced transparency and analytic insight. As U.S. mortgage loan market participants work to minimize the risk in lending, servicing and capital markets, they rely on the integration of data and analytics with solutions that enhance the decision-making process. These industry participants rely on large comprehensive third-party databases coupled with enhanced analytics to achieve these goals. The pandemic is putting pressure on the U.S. economy, affecting millions of American jobs and creating a high-level of uncertainty in the volume of work that our clients are facing with possible 
delinquent mortgage loans. Mortgage loan market participants are eager for timely data and insights to help them plan and react to the changing environment.
Regulatory changes and oversight. Most U.S. mortgage loan market participants are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight and regulatory requirements as federal and state governments have enacted various new laws, rules and regulations. It is our experience that mortgage lenders have become more focused on minimizing the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements and are looking toward solutions that assist them in complying with their regulatory requirements. We expect this trend to continue as additional governmental programs and regulations have been recently enacted to address the economic concerns resulting from the pandemic, and our clients have had to adapt their systems and processes in record time to the shifting landscape. In addition, our clients and our clients' regulators have elevated their focus on privacy and data security while many of our clients’ employees are working from home and in light of an increased level of cybersecurity incidents. We expect the industry focus on privacy and data security to continue to increase.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our competitive strengths include the following:
•Market leadership with comprehensive and integrated solutions. We are a leading provider of comprehensive and integrated solutions. We believe our leadership position is, in part, the result of our unique expertise and insight developed from over 55 years serving the needs of clients in the mortgage loan industry. We have used this insight to develop an integrated and comprehensive suite of proprietary software, data and analytics solutions to automate many of the mission-critical business processes across the entire homeownership lifecycle. These integrated solutions are designed to reduce manual processes, assist in improving organizational compliance and mitigating risk, and to ultimately deliver significant cost savings to our clients. Our digital ecosystem encompasses various elements of the mortgage loan lifecycle. By migrating to a digital homebuying environment, we believe we provide modern solutions for an increasingly digital world.
•Broad and deep client relationships with significant recurring revenues. We have long-standing, sticky relationships with our largest clients. We frequently enter into long-term contracts with our software solutions clients that contain a base fee that is contractually obligated. Our products are typically embedded within our clients' mission-critical workflow and decision-making processes across various parts of their organizations. 
•Extensive data assets and analytics capabilities. We develop and maintain large, accurate and comprehensive data sets on the mortgage loan and housing industry that we believe are competitively differentiated. Our unique data sets provide a combination of public and proprietary data, and each of our data records features a large number of attributes. Our data scientists utilize our data sets, subject to any applicable use restrictions, and comprehensive analytical capabilities to create highly customized reports, including models of customer behavior for originators and servicers, portfolio analytics for capital markets and government agencies and proprietary market insights for 
real estate agencies. Our data and analytics capabilities are also embedded into our software solutions and workflow products, providing our clients with integrated and comprehensive solutions.
•Scalable and cost-effective operating model. We believe we have a highly attractive and scalable operating model derived from our market leadership, hosted software solutions and the large number of clients we serve. Our scalable operating model provides us with significant benefits. Our scale and operating leverage allows us to add incremental clients to our existing platforms with limited incremental cost. As a result, our operating model drives attractive margins and generates significant cash flow. Also, by leveraging our scale and leading market position, we are able to make cost-effective investments in our software solutions to assist with complex regulatory and compliance requirements, which we believe increases our value proposition to clients.
Our Strategy
Our comprehensive and integrated software solutions, robust data and analytic capabilities, differentiated business model, broad and deep client relationships and other competitive strengths enable us to pursue multiple growth opportunities. We intend to continue to expand our business and grow through the following key strategies:
•Win new clients. We intend to attract new clients by demonstrating the value proposition provided by our software and comprehensive solutions offering. In particular, we believe there is a significant opportunity to penetrate the mid-tier mortgage loan originators and servicers market. We believe these institutions can benefit from our proven solutions suite in order to address complex regulatory requirements and compete more effectively in the evolving mortgage loan market. We intend to continue to pursue this channel and benefit from the low incremental cost of adding new clients to our scalable applications and infrastructure.
•Cross-sell existing products. We believe our established client base presents a substantial opportunity for growth. We seek to capitalize on the trend of standardization and increased adoption of leading third-party solutions and increase the number of solutions provided to our existing client base. We intend to broaden and deepen our client relationships by cross-selling our suite of end-to-end software solutions, as well as our robust data and analytics. By helping our clients understand the full extent of our comprehensive solutions and the value of leveraging the multiple solutions we offer, we believe we can expand our existing relationships by allowing our clients to focus on their core businesses and their customers.
•Solution development and innovation. Our long-term vision is to be the industry-leading provider for participants of the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals for their platform, data and analytic needs. We intend to enhance what we believe is a leadership position by continuing to innovate new solutions with urgency and integrate those solutions with our platforms. We have a strong track record of introducing and developing new solutions that span the homeownership lifecycle, are tailored to specific industry trends and enhance our clients' core operating functions. By working in partnership with key clients, we have been able to develop and market new and advanced solutions to our client base that meet the evolving demands of the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals. In addition, we will continue to develop and leverage insights from our large public and proprietary data assets to further improve our client value proposition.
•Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions. The core focus of our strategy is to grow organically. However, we may selectively evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that would allow us to expand our footprint, broaden our client base and deepen our product and service offerings. We believe that there are meaningful synergies that result from acquiring companies that provide best-in-class single point solutions. Integrating and cross-selling these point solutions into our broader client base and integrating acquisitions into our efficient operating environment would potentially result in revenues and cost synergies.
Our Clients
We have numerous clients in each category of service that we offer. A significant focus of our marketing efforts is on the top-tier and mid-tier U.S. mortgage loan originators and servicers. We also provide our solutions to a number of other financial institutions, investors, attorneys, trustees and real estate professionals.
The U.S. mortgage loan industry is concentrated among the top 25 institutions, and our most significant and long-term relationships tend to follow the industry landscape. We typically provide a growing number of solutions to each client. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our aggregate revenues from our largest clients.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, one of our clients accounted for approximately 11% of our Software Solutions segment revenues and another client accounted for approximately 11% of our Data and Analytics segment revenues. No client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 30% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 32% of our Software Solutions segment revenues. However, the revenues in each case are spread across a range of services and are subject to multiple, separate contracts. Although the diversity of the services we provide to 
each of these clients reduces the risk that we would lose all of the revenues associated with any of these clients, a significant deterioration in our relationships with or the loss of any one or more of these clients could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Report.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on both winning new clients as well as cross-selling our broad solution set to existing clients.
We have teams of experienced sales personnel with subject matter expertise in particular services and in the needs of the companies in the markets we serve. Marketing activities include direct marketing, print and digital advertising, media relations, video, web-based activities, thought leadership, client meetings and conferences, tradeshow and convention activities and other targeted initiatives. We continue to adapt our sales and marketing efforts based on the current environment to offer a number of virtual tools and techniques that allow us to continue to engage with current and potential clients.
We engage with existing clients on a regular basis and continually focus on engaging with prospective clients. Given the broad range of solutions we offer, we have significant opportunity to expand our sales to our existing client base through cross-selling efforts. We have established a core team of account managers who cross-sell solutions to existing clients at the top-tier and mid-tier U.S. mortgage loan originators and servicers, as well as a number of other financial institutions, investors and real estate professionals. 
We engage in strategic account reviews, during which our executives share their knowledge of clients and the market in order to determine the best sales approach on a client-by-client basis. As a result, we believe we have created an effective cross-selling culture within our organization.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities relate primarily to the design, development and enhancement of our software applications. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our infrastructure. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices and copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect our software, technology, data and expertise. Further, we have developed a number of brands that have accumulated goodwill in the marketplace, and we rely on the above to protect our rights in that area. We intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our copyright, trade secret and trademark rights.
Competition
The businesses in which we engage are highly competitive. Competitive factors in processing businesses include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and pricing. We believe that our integrated software solutions and economies of scale in the mortgage loan origination and servicing markets provide us with a competitive advantage in each of these categories. Based on our knowledge of the industry and competitors, we also believe that no single competitor offers the depth and breadth of solutions we are able to offer.
Software Solutions. With respect to our Software Solutions segment, we compete with our clients' internal technology departments and other providers of similar systems, such as Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.'s Mortgage Technology segment and Sagent Lending Technologies. Competitive factors include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and pricing. We believe that our integrated software solutions and economies of scale in the mortgage loan processing business provide us with a competitive advantage in each of these categories.
Data and Analytics. In our Data and Analytics segment, we primarily compete with CoreLogic, Inc., First American Financial Corporation, in-house capabilities and certain niche providers. We compete based on the breadth and depth of our data, the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets and the capabilities to create highly customized reports. We believe that the quality of the data we offer is distinguished by the broad range of our data sources, including non-public sources, the volume of records we maintain, our ability to integrate our data and analytics with our software solutions and the ability to leverage our market leading position in the mortgage loan origination and servicing industries.
Government Regulations
Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal and state regulations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide certain services, as well as the possible imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.
As a provider of electronic data processing to financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC"), an interagency body of the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and various other federal and state regulatory authorities. We also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities.
Our financial institution clients are required to comply with various privacy laws and regulations under state and federal law, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and regulations place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the same privacy regulations and are generally bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as those that apply to the financial institutions themselves.
The financial crisis of 2008 resulted in increased scrutiny of all parties involved in the mortgage loan industry by governmental authorities. This scrutiny has included federal and state governmental review of all aspects of the mortgage lending business, including an increased legislative and regulatory focus on consumer protection practices. Future legislative or regulatory changes are difficult to predict and new laws or regulations that may be implemented by the CFPB or other regulatory bodies may require us to change our business practices or cause us to incur increased costs to comply.
Many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, they have implemented or are seeking to implement further restrictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), the New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies ("NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation") and the Vermont Act Relating to Data Brokers and Consumer Protection ("Vermont Data Broker Law"), on the acquisition, dissemination or commercial use of personal information within the public and private sectors and are also contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours. We are also subject to these state regulations.
Information Technology and Security
We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication and we expect this trend to continue. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. These attacks can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information. Refer to the "Risks Related to Information Security" section of Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
We protect our data assets by providing centralized security solutions and enforcing a defense-in-depth, centralized model that includes deterring, detecting, preventing, analyzing and containing security incidents. We focus on all areas of cybersecurity including threat and vulnerability management, security monitoring, identity and access management, phishing awareness, risk oversight, third-party risk management, disaster recovery and continuity management. We make strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses for hardware, software, personnel and consulting services. 
As our primary solutions and services evolve, we apply a comprehensive approach to the mitigation of identified security risks. We have established policies, including those related to privacy, information security and cybersecurity, and we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques.
•Enterprise Risk Management: We maintain a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") program that provides the framework to align our risk appetite and strategy to enhance management of enterprise risks, including information security risks. Through our ERM program, we analyze risks inherent to our products, services and businesses, and develop appropriate plans to mitigate those risks. The executive-level Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee convenes regularly to discuss matters relating to our enterprise risk position and risk management, such as third-party risk, phishing, security incident response, application resiliency, environmental, social and governance responsibilities and external and internal vulnerabilities. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the 
ERM and Compliance programs through regular reports from our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, and reports on these matters to our board of directors.
•Compliance: Our Compliance function provides the standards and policies to mitigate identified risks, as well as training for our employees on applicable privacy, security, legal and regulatory requirements that provide ongoing enhancement of our security and risk culture. 
•Internal Audit: Our Internal Audit function provides provides independent and objective assurance services designed to improve the Company’s operations. Internal Audit focuses a significant portion of their time and resources to the audit of information technology and security. The Internal Audit department is established by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and it directly oversees its results and operations.
Human Capital Management
We power the markets we serve by delivering cutting-edge solutions. Our employees are a key component of our success. Our most important priorities are the health and safety of our employees. Since March 2020, substantially all of our employees have been working from home. We instituted safety protocols and procedures throughout our facilities for essential employees who are on site. In addition, we expanded our employee benefits and other online resources to enable employees to focus on their physical, emotional and social well-being.
We are passionate about giving our employees the tools to equip them for success in their careers, providing the health and wellness benefits needed for physical, mental and social well-being, and delivering on diversity and inclusion initiatives to let every employee know they are valued and respected.
We realize our individual differences are what strengthen us collectively. We are committed to supporting a culture that is representative of the unique values, opinions, cultures and needs of our employees, clients and communities. Through internal programs, including employee training and leadership development, comprehensive benefits and a hands-on leadership team, we support our employees throughout their career. 
We strive to attract and retain the most talented employees in the industry by offering competitive compensation and investing in our employees' physical, mental and social well-being to help them achieve goals inside and outside of the office.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 5,700 employees. None of our workforce is unionized. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with employees to be good.
