ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 
 Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the “Corporation”) was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1929. The Corporation, individually or together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is also referred to herein as the “Registrant.” The Corporation manufactures and sells highly engineered, high-performance specialty metal products and customized equipment utilized by industry throughout the world. It operates in two business segments, the Forged and Cast Engineered Products (“FCEP”) segment and the Air and Liquid Processing segment. This segment presentation is consistent with how the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker evaluates the financial performance and makes resource allocation and strategic decisions about the business.

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), and advised of the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. In response, many state and local governments required the closure of various businesses. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, however, provided guidance identifying the Corporation’s domestic businesses as critical infrastructure industries, essential to the economic prosperity, security and continuity of the United States, which provides exceptions to certain closures mandated by state and local governments and permits businesses to continue operations during such order. Despite the designation, the Corporation has had to periodically and temporarily idle certain operations of its FCEP segment and, consequently, furlough certain of its employees in response to market conditions. To date, the Air and Liquid Processing segment has successfully mitigated the negative impact on sales and operating income resulting from the pandemic.
 Also, in 2020, the Corporation completed an equity rights offering for shares of its common stock and Series A warrants to existing shareholders for net proceeds of $18.1 million. A majority of the proceeds from the equity rights offering was used to repay borrowings under the Corporation’s revolving credit facility. 
 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 Forged and Cast Engineered Products Segment 
 The FCEP segment produces forged hardened steel rolls, cast rolls and open-die forged products. Forged hardened steel rolls are used primarily in cold rolling mills by producers of steel, aluminum and other metals. Cast rolls, which are produced in a variety of iron and steel qualities, are used mainly in hot and cold strip mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills. Forged engineered products (“FEP”) are principally sold to customers in the steel distribution market, oil and gas industry and the aluminum and plastic extrusion industries. The segment has operations in the United States, England, Sweden, Slovenia, and an equity interest in three joint venture companies in China. Collectively, the segment primarily competes with European, Asian and North and South American companies in both domestic and foreign markets and distributes a significant portion of its products through sales offices located throughout the world.
 Union Electric Steel Corporation produces forged hardened steel rolls and open-die forged products. It is headquartered in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, with three manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania and one in Indiana.

Aerofin Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation produces custom-engineered finned tube heat exchange coils and related heat transfer products for a variety of industries including OEM/commercial, nuclear power generation and industrial manufacturing, and is located in Lynchburg, Virginia. 
 Buffalo Air Handling Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation produces large custom-designed air handling systems for institutional (e.g., hospital, university), pharmaceutical and general industrial building markets, and is located in Amherst, Virginia. 
 Buffalo Pumps Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation manufactures centrifugal pumps for the fossil fueled power generation, marine defense and industrial refrigeration industries, and is located in North Tonawanda, New York. 
 Products
 In both segments, the products are dependent on engineering, principally custom designed, and are sold to sophisticated commercial and industrial users located throughout the world. Products are delivered directly to the customer via third-party carriers or customer-arranged transportation. For additional information on the products produced and financial information about each segment, see Note 17, Revenue, and 
Note 24, Business Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Raw Materials 
 Raw materials used in both segments are generally available from many sources and neither segment is dependent upon any single supplier for any raw material. Substantial volumes of raw materials used by each segment are subject to significant variations in price. The Corporation’s subsidiaries generally do not purchase or commit for the purchase of a major portion of raw materials significantly in advance of the time they require such materials but do make forward commitments for certain commodities (copper and aluminum). See Note 15, Derivative Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 Patents and Trademarks 
 While the Corporation and its subsidiaries hold certain patents, trademarks and licenses, in the opinion of the Corporation, they are not material to either segment. 
 Backlog
 The backlog of orders at December 31, 2020, was approximately $246 million compared to a backlog of $321 million at year-end 2019. The reduction in backlog is attributable to the FCEP segment due to customers postponing order placement given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and several of the FCEP segment’s largest customers adjusting their ordering patterns. The reduction is not a reflection of any loss of market share. Approximately 8% of the backlog is expected to be released after 2021.
Competition 
 The Corporation faces considerable competition from a large number of companies in both segments. The Corporation believes, however, that its subsidiaries are significant participants in each of the niche markets that they serve. Competition in both segments is based on quality, service, price, and delivery. 
Environmental Protection Compliance Costs 
 Expenditures for environmental control matters were not material to either segment in 2020 and are not expected to be material in 2021. 
 Employees and Human Capital Management
 Employees
 On December 31, 2020, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had 1,533 active employees worldwide, of which approximately 50% are employed in the United States and approximately 50% are outside the United States. Approximately one-third of the Corporation’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils.  
Oversight
 The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors maintains oversight of the Corporation’s human capital management strategies that it may deem important to the long-term sustainability of the Corporation.
