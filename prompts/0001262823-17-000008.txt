Item 1. Business
General
We are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. Our products include some of the most widely used chemicals in the world, which are fundamental to many diverse consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, water treatment, refrigerants, residential and commercial construction as well as other durable and non-durable goods. We operate in two principal operating segments, Olefins and Vinyls. We are highly integrated along our olefins product chain with significant downstream integration into polyethylene and styrene monomer. We are also an integrated global producer of vinyls with substantial downstream integration into polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") building products.
We began operations in 1986 after our first polyethylene plant, an Olefins segment business, near Lake Charles, Louisiana was acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation. We began our vinyls operations in 1990 with the acquisition of a vinyl chloride monomer ("VCM") plant in Calvert City, Kentucky from the Goodrich Corporation. In 1992, we commenced our Vinyls segment building products operations after acquiring three PVC pipe plants. Since 1986, we have grown rapidly into an integrated global producer of petrochemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. We achieved this by acquiring existing plants or constructing new plants and completing numerous capacity or production line expansions. We regularly consider acquisitions and other internal and external growth opportunities that would be consistent with or complementary to our overall business strategy.
In 2014, we formed Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Partners") to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. Also in 2014, Westlake Partners completed an initial public offering of 12,937,500 common units (the "Westlake Partners IPO"). As of February 15, 2017, Westlake Partners' assets consist of a 13.3% limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo LP ("OpCo"), as well as the general partner interest in OpCo. Prior to the Westlake Partners IPO, OpCo's assets were wholly owned by us. OpCo's assets include two ethylene production facilities at our olefins facility at our Lake Charles site, one ethylene production facility at our Calvert City site and a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from Mont Belvieu, Texas to the Longview, Texas site, which includes our Longview polyethylene production facility. We retain an 86.7% limited partner interest in OpCo, a 52.2% limited partner interest in Westlake Partners (common and subordinated units), a general partner interest in Westlake Partners and incentive distribution rights. The operations of Westlake Partners are consolidated in our financial statements. We are party to certain agreements with Westlake Partners and OpCo whereby, among other things, OpCo sells us 95% of the ethylene it produces on a cost-plus basis that is expected to generate a fixed margin per pound of $0.10. We use this ethylene in the production processes of both our Olefins and Vinyls segments. For more information, see "—Olefins Business" and "—Vinyls Business" below.
On August 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Axiall Corporation ("Axiall") for $33.00 per share in an all-cash transaction (the "Merger"), pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of June 10, 2016, by and among Westlake, Axiall and Lagoon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westlake. Axiall is a manufacturer and international marketer of chemicals and building products, with manufacturing sites in North America. The combined company is the third-largest global chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest PVC producer in the world.
We benefit from highly integrated production facilities that allow us to process raw materials into higher value-added chemicals and building products. As of February 15, 2017, we (directly and through OpCo and our 95% and 60% owned Asian joint ventures) had 39.8 billion pounds per year of aggregate production capacity at numerous manufacturing sites in North America, Europe and Asia.
Olefins Business
Products
Olefins are the basic building blocks used to create a wide variety of petrochemical products. We manufacture ethylene (through OpCo), polyethylene, styrene and associated co-products at our manufacturing facility in Lake Charles and polyethylene at our Longview facility. We have two ethylene plants, which are owned by OpCo, two polyethylene plants and one styrene monomer plant at our olefins facility at our Lake Charles site. We have three polyethylene plants and a specialty polyethylene wax plant at our Longview site.

______________________________

(1) | Production capacity owned by OpCo.

Ethylene. Ethylene is the world's most widely used petrochemical in terms of volume. It is the key building block used to produce a large number of higher value-added chemicals including polyethylene, EDC, VCM and styrene. OpCo has the capacity to produce 3.0 billion pounds of ethylene per year at our olefins facility at our Lake Charles site, and we have the capability to consume all of OpCo's production that we purchase at Lake Charles to produce polyethylene and styrene monomer in our Olefins business and to produce VCM and EDC in our Vinyls business. OpCo also produces ethylene for our Vinyls segment at our Calvert City site, and substantially all of the ethylene we purchase from OpCo at Calvert City is used internally in the production of VCM. For OpCo's annual ethylene production that is purchased by us for our Vinyls business, see "Business—Vinyls Business." In addition, we (through OpCo) produce ethylene co-products including chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. We (through OpCo) sell our entire output of these co-products to external customers. OpCo completed an upgrade and capacity expansion of its Petro 1 ethylene unit at our Lake Charles site in the third quarter of 2016. The Petro 1 expansion project increased OpCo's ethylene capacity by approximately 250 million pounds annually.
Polyethylene. Polyethylene, the world's most widely consumed polymer, is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of film, coatings and molded product applications primarily used in packaging. Polyethylene is generally classified as either LDPE, LLDPE or high-density polyethylene ("HDPE"). The density correlates to the relative stiffness of the end-use products. The difference between LDPE and LLDPE is molecular, and products produced from LLDPE, in general, have higher strength properties than products produced from LDPE. LDPE exhibits better clarity and other physical properties and is used in end products such as bread bags, dry cleaning bags, food wraps, milk carton coatings and snack food packaging. LLDPE is used for higher film strength applications such as stretch film and heavy duty sacks. HDPE is used to manufacture products such as grocery, merchandise and trash bags, rigid plastic containers, plastic closures and pipe.
We are the leading producer of LDPE by capacity in North America and predominantly use the autoclave technology (versus tubular technology), which is capable of producing higher margin specialty polyethylene products. In 2016, our annual capacity of 1.5 billion pounds was available in numerous formulations to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. We also have the capacity to produce 1.1 billion pounds of LLDPE per year in various formulations. We produce LDPE and LLDPE at both Lake Charles and Longview. Our Lake Charles and Longview facilities also have the capability to produce HDPE. We sell polyethylene to external customers as a final product in pellet form.
Styrene. Styrene is used to produce derivatives such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, unsaturated polyester and synthetic rubber. These derivatives are used in a number of applications including consumer disposables, food packaging, housewares, paints and coatings, building materials, tires and toys. We produce styrene at our Lake Charles plant, where we have the capacity to produce 570 million pounds of styrene per year, all of which is sold to external customers.
Feedstocks
We are highly integrated along our olefins product chain. We (through OpCo) produce most of the ethylene required to produce our polyethylene and styrene. Ethylene can be produced from either petroleum liquid feedstocks, such as naphtha, condensates and gas oils, or from natural gas liquid feedstocks, such as ethane, propane and butane. Both of OpCo's Lake Charles ethylene plants use ethane as the primary feedstock. Pursuant to a feedstock supply agreement between us and OpCo, OpCo receives ethane feedstock at our olefins facility at our Lake Charles site through several pipelines from a variety of 
2

suppliers in Texas and Louisiana. We own a 50% interest in a 104-mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Mont Belvieu to our Lake Charles site. OpCo owns a 200-mile ethylene pipeline that runs from Mont Belvieu to our Longview site.
In addition to ethylene supplied by OpCo, we also acquire ethylene from third parties in order to supply a portion of our ethylene requirements. We acquire butene and hexene to manufacture polyethylene and benzene to manufacture styrene. We receive butene and hexene at the Lake Charles site and hexene at the Longview site via rail car from several suppliers. We receive benzene via barges, ships and pipeline pursuant to short-term arrangements. We purchase butene and hexene pursuant to multi-year contracts, some of which are renewable for an additional term subject to either party to the contract notifying the other party that it does not wish to renew the contract. We purchase electricity for our Lake Charles facility under long-term industrial contracts.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have an internal sales force that sells our products directly to our customers. Our polyethylene customers are some of the nation's largest producers of film and flexible packaging.
We and OpCo sell ethylene and ethylene co-products to external customers. OpCo's primary ethylene co-products are chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. Our and OpCo's sales are made under spot and long-term agreements.
We have storage agreements and exchange agreements that allow us and OpCo access to customers who are not directly connected to the pipeline system that we own. OpCo ships crude butadiene and pyrolysis gasoline by rail or truck. Additionally, we transport our polyethylene and styrene by rail or truck. Further, styrene can be transported by barge or ship.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the Olefins segment in 2016. 
Competition
The markets in which our Olefins business operates are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of customer service, product deliverability, quality, consistency, performance and price. Our competitors in the ethylene, polyethylene and styrene markets are some of the world's largest chemical companies, including Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, The Dow Chemical Company, ExxonMobil Chemical Company, INEOS Group Limited, LyondellBasell Industries, N.V. and NOVA Chemicals Corporation.
Vinyls Business
Products
Principal products in our integrated Vinyls segment include PVC, VCM, EDC, chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic soda) and chlorinated derivative products and, through OpCo, ethylene. We also manufacture and sell building products fabricated from PVC, including siding, pipe, fittings, profiles, trim, mouldings, fence and decking products, window and door components and film and sheet products. We manage our integrated Vinyls production chain, from the basic chemicals to finished building products, to optimize product margins and capacity utilization. Our primary North American chemical manufacturing facilities are located in our Calvert City, Kentucky and Lake Charles, Plaquemine and Geismar, Louisiana sites. Our Calvert City site includes an ethylene plant, which is owned by OpCo, a chlor-alkali plant, a VCM plant and a PVC plant.

PVC and PVC Compounds. PVC, the world's third most widely used plastic, is an attractive alternative to traditional materials such as glass, metal, wood, concrete and other plastic materials because of its versatility, durability and cost-competitiveness. PVC is produced from VCM, which is, in turn, made from chlorine and ethylene. PVC compounds are highly customized formulations that offer specific end-use properties based on customer-determined manufacturing specifications. PVC compounds are made by combining PVC resin with various additives in order to make either rigid and impact-resistant or soft and flexible compounds. The various compounds are then fabricated into end-products through extrusion, calendering, injection-molding or blow-molding. Flexible PVC compounds are used for wire and cable insulation, medical films and packaging, flooring, wall coverings, automotive interior and exterior trims and packaging. Rigid extrusion PVC compounds are commonly used in window and door profiles, vertical blinds and construction products, including pipe and siding. Injection-molding PVC compounds are used in specialty products such as computer housings and keyboards, appliance parts and bottles.
We are the third-largest PVC producer in the world. We have the capacity to produce 5.7 billion pounds and 1.1 billion pounds of commodity and specialty PVC per year, respectively, at our various facilities globally. We use some of our North American-produced PVC internally in the production of our building products and PVC compounds. The remainder of our PVC, including the PVC produced at our European and Asian facilities, is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets.
VCM. VCM is used to produce PVC, solvents and PVC-related products. We use ethylene and chlorine to produce VCM. We have the capacity to produce 5.5 billion pounds and 1.5 billion pounds of VCM per year at our North American and European facilities, respectively. The majority of our VCM is used internally in our PVC operations. VCM not used internally is sold to other vinyl resins producers in domestic and international markets.
Chlorine and Caustic Soda. We combine salt and electricity to produce chlorine and caustic soda, commonly referred to as chlor-alkali, at our Lake Charles, Plaquemine, Natrium, Calvert City, Geismar, Beauharnois, Longview, Gendorf, and Knapsack, Germany and Kaohsiung facilities. We are the third-largest chlor-alkali producer in the world. We use our chlorine production in our VCM and chlorinated derivative products plants. We currently have the capacity to supply all of our chlorine requirements internally. Any remaining chlorine is sold into the North American merchant chlorine market. Our caustic soda is sold to external customers who use it for, among other things, the production of pulp and paper, organic and inorganic chemicals and alumina.
4

Chlorinated Derivative Products. Our chlorinated derivative products include ethyl chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, tri-ethane® solvents, VersaTRANS® solvents, calcium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid ("HCL"). We have the capacity to produce 2.3 billion pounds of chlorinated derivative products per year, primarily at our Lake Charles, Natrium, Beauharnois and Longview facilities. The majority of our chlorinated derivative products is sold to external customers who use it for, among other things, refrigerants, water treatment applications, chemicals and pharmaceutical production, food processing, steel pickling and natural gas and oil production.
Ethylene. We use the ethylene we purchase that is produced by OpCo at Calvert City to produce VCM. OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant has the capacity to produce approximately 20% of the ethylene required for our total VCM production. We obtain the remainder of the ethylene we need for our Vinyls business from OpCo's Lake Charles plant and from third party purchases. OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant utilizes ethane feedstock and enables us, through OpCo, to enhance our vinyl chain integration. In January 2016, OpCo announced an expansion project to increase the ethylene capacity of its ethylene plant at our Calvert City facility. The expansion, along with other initiatives, is expected to increase ethylene capacity by approximately 100 million pounds annually and is targeted for completion during the first half of 2017.
Building Products. Products made from PVC are used in construction materials ranging from water and sewer systems to home and commercial applications for siding, trim, mouldings, fence, deck, window and door systems. Our building products consist of two primary product groups: (i) exterior products, which includes siding, trim, mouldings, window profiles, fence and decking products; and (ii) PVC pipe, specialty PVC pipe and fittings. We manufacture and market exterior products under the Royal Building Products®, Celect Cellular Exteriors by Royal®, Zuri Premium Decking by Royal®, Royal S4S Trim Board® and Exterior Portfolio® brand names. We manufacture and market specialty pipe and fittings, water, sewer, irrigation and conduit pipe products under the North American Pipe® and Royal Building Products® brand names. We manufacture film and sheet at our Shanghai facility for both Asian and global markets. All of our building products are sold to external customers. The combined capacity of our 26 building products plants is 2.0 billion pounds per year.
Feedstocks 
We are highly integrated along our vinyls production chain. We produce most of the ethylene required by our Calvert City and Geismar facilities (through OpCo). Ethylene produced at OpCo's Calvert City facility utilizes ethane feedstock. We purchase the remainder of the ethylene required for our other North American and European facilities from a number of sources under various contracts. We have access to, and partially own, an ethylene pipeline in Germany. We have long-term leases on salt domes, from which we supply our salt brine requirements by pipeline, close to our Lake Charles chlor-alkali plant. The salt requirements for our Plaquemine and Natrium chlor-alkali plants are supplied internally from our salt domes. We purchase the salt required for our other chlor-alkali plants pursuant to long-term contracts. Electricity and steam for one of our Lake Charles facilities are produced by both on-site cogeneration units and through a toll arrangement with RS Cogen, LLC ("RS Cogen"), a joint venture in which we own a 50% interest. RS Cogen operates a process steam, natural gas-fired cogeneration facility adjacent to the site. Electricity and steam for the Plaquemine facility is supplied internally by our on-site cogeneration unit. A portion of our Natrium facility's electricity requirements is produced by our on-site generation unit, and the remainder purchased under an industrial contract. We purchase electricity for our remaining North American and European facilities under long-term industrial contracts. We purchase VCM for our Asian PVC plant on a contract and spot basis.
Our North American and Asian facilities supply predominantly all of the PVC required for our building products plants. We may also purchase PVC at market prices, if needed. The remaining feedstocks for building products include pigments, fillers, stabilizers and other ingredients, which we purchase under short-term contracts based on prevailing market prices.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have a dedicated sales force for our business, organized by product line and region. In addition, we rely on distributors to market products to smaller customers. We use some of our North American-produced PVC internally in the production of our building products and PVC compounds. The remainder of our PVC, including the PVC produced at our European and Asian facilities, is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets. We have the capacity to use a majority of our chlorine internally to produce VCM and EDC, most of which, in turn, is used to produce PVC. We also use our chlorine internally to produce chlorinated derivative products. We sell the remainder of our chlorine and substantially all of our caustic soda production to external customers. The majority of our products are shipped from production facilities directly to the customer via pipeline, truck, rail, barge and/or ship. The remaining products are shipped from production facilities to third party chemical terminals and warehouses until being sold to customers.
We are the second largest manufacturer of PVC pipe by capacity in the United States. We sell a majority of our siding, trim and mouldings products, PVC pipe, specialty PVC pipe and fittings, and film and sheet products through a combination of our internal sales force and manufacturer's representatives. In Canada, we operate 19 company-owned distribution branches that sell our vinyl siding and accessories and trim and mouldings products, as well as pipe and fittings. We also engage in 
5

advertising programs primarily directed at trade professionals that are intended to develop awareness and interest in our products. In addition, we display our building products at trade shows.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the Vinyls segment in 2016.

Environmental
As is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business. National, state or provincial and local standards regulating air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. Compliance with such laws and regulations has required and will continue to require capital expenditures and increase operating costs.
It is our policy to comply with all environmental, health and safety requirements and to provide safe and environmentally sound workplaces for our employees. In some cases, compliance can be achieved only by incurring capital expenditures. In 2016, we made capital expenditures of $16.2 million related to environmental compliance. We estimate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $27.0 million in 2017 and $33.0 million in 2018, respectively, related to environmental compliance.
See our discussion of our environmental matters contained in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" below, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" below and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 8,870 employees in the following areas: 

Category | Number
Olefins segment | 840 
Vinyls segment | 7,700 
Corporate and other | 330 

Approximately 34% of our employees are represented by labor unions, and all of these union employees are working under collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times through 2021. We have multiple collective bargaining agreements in Europe, Canada and the United States, with varying expiration years, covering different groups of our work force. There were no strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages in 2016 and we believe that our relationship with our employees and unions is open and positive.
Technology 
Historically, our technology strategy has been to selectively acquire licenses from third-parties, as well as develop our own proprietary technology. Our selection process incorporates many factors, including the cost of the technology, the ability to meet our customers' requirements, raw material and energy consumption rates, product quality, capital costs, maintenance requirements and reliability. Most of the technology licensed from third-party providers is perpetual and has been paid in full. We own an intellectual property portfolio developed from focused research in both process and product technology. After acquiring or developing a technology, we devote considerable effort to effectively employ the technology and further its development, with a focus towards continuous improvement of our competitive positions.
Conversely, we have selectively granted licenses to our patented Energx® technology for LLDPE production and for proprietary LDPE reactor mixing technology. We have also granted several licenses for EDC/VCM technology, including the direct chlorination process and catalyst, and S-PVC process and technology.
