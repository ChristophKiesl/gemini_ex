ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Physicians Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, and Physicians Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, were organized in April 2013 to acquire, selectively develop, own and manage health care properties that are leased to physicians, hospitals, and health care delivery systems. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “Physicians Realty” refer to the Trust, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. References to the “Operating Partnership” mean collectively the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in July 2013. The Trust’s common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and it is included in the MSCI US REIT Index and MidCap 400.
We have grown our consolidated portfolio of gross real estate investments from approximately $124 million at the time of our IPO to approximately $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 263 health care properties located in 31 states with approximately 14,011,008 net leasable square feet, which were approximately 96% leased with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 6.8 years. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 90% of the net leasable square footage of our consolidated portfolio was either on campus with a hospital or other health care facility or strategically affiliated with a hospital or other health care provider organization.
We receive a cash rental stream from health care providers under our leases. Approximately 94% of the annualized base rent payments from our properties as of December 31, 2020 are from absolute and triple-net leases, pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property, including but not limited to real estate taxes, utilities, property insurance, routine maintenance and repairs, and property management. This structure helps insulate us from increases in certain operating expenses and provides relatively predictable cash flow. We seek to structure our leases to generate attractive returns on a long-term basis. Our leases typically have initial terms of 5 to 15 years and include annual rent escalators of approximately 1.5% to 3.0%, with an annual weighted average rent escalator of approximately 2.4%. Our operating results depend significantly upon the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that our portfolio of medical office buildings and other health care facilities will enable us to generate stable cash flows over time because of the diversity of our tenants, staggered lease expiration schedule, long-term leases, and low historical occurrence of tenants defaulting under their leases. As of December 31, 2020, leases representing a percentage of our consolidated portfolio on the basis of leased square feet will expire as follows: 

Year | Portfolio Lease Expirations
MTM (1) | 0.4% 
2021 | 4.3% 
2022 | 4.4% 
2023 | 4.8% 
2024 | 6.1% 
2025 | 7.7% 
2026 | 23.9% 
2027 | 10.2% 
2028 | 10.1% 
2029 | 4.3% 
2030 | 4.3% 
Thereafter | 19.5% 
Total | 100.0% 

(1)“MTM” means month-to-month. This line also includes 12 leases which expired on December 31, 2020, representing 0.2% of leased square feet.
We invest in real estate that is integral to providing high quality health care services. Our properties are typically located on a campus with a hospital or other health care facilities or strategically affiliated with a hospital or other health care system. We believe the impact of government programs and continuing trends in the health care industry create attractive opportunities for us to invest in health care-related real estate. Our management team has significant public health care REIT 
experience and has long established relationships with physicians, hospitals, and health care delivery system decision makers who we believe will provide quality investment and growth opportunities. Our principal investments include medical office buildings, outpatient treatment facilities, and other real estate integral to health care providers. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders through a combination of stable and increasing dividends and potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and our common shares.
The Trust is a Maryland real estate investment trust and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We conduct our business through an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our properties are owned by the Operating Partnership directly or through limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or other subsidiaries. The Trust is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of February 22, 2021, owned approximately 97.4% of the OP Units.
Our Objectives and Growth Strategy
Overview
Our principal business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders through a combination of (i) sustainable and increasing rental revenue and cash flow that generate reliable, increasing dividends, and (ii) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and common shares. 
Our primary strategy to achieve our business objective is to utilize our physician and hospital relationships nationwide to identify off-market opportunities to invest in, own, and manage a diversified portfolio of high quality health care properties, and to understand our tenants’ real estate strategies, which we believe will drive high retention, high occupancy, and reliable, increasing rental revenue cash flow and growth.
We intend to grow our portfolio of high-quality health care properties leased to physicians, hospitals, health care delivery systems, and other health care providers primarily through acquisitions of existing health care facilities that provide stable revenue growth and predictable long-term cash flows. We may also selectively finance the development of new health care facilities with premier health care real estate developers. Generally, we expect to make investments in new development properties when approximately 80% or more of the development property has been pre-leased before construction commences. We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound health care providers and health care delivery systems that offer need-based health care services in sustainable health care markets. We focus our investment activity on medical office buildings (“MOB”) and ambulatory surgery centers.

We may from time to time also make investments in other health care properties. We believe that trends such as shifting consumer preferences, limited space in hospitals, the desires of patients and health care providers to limit non-essential services provided in a hospital setting, and cost considerations continue to drive the industry towards performing more procedures in off-campus outpatient facilities versus the hospital setting. As these trends continue, we believe that demand for medical office buildings and similar health care properties away from hospital settings and in convenient locations to patients will continue to rise. We intend to exploit this trend and favor off-campus properties consistent with our investment philosophy and strategies.
While not our focus, we may at some point decide to invest opportunistically in life science facilities, senior housing properties, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals, and treatment centers. Consistent with the Trust’s qualification as a REIT, we may also opportunistically invest in companies that provide health care services, and in joint venture entities with operating partners structured to comply with the REIT Investment Diversification Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”).
As of December 31, 2020, we have grown our consolidated portfolio of gross real estate investments to approximately $4.9 billion while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. For short-term funding purposes, we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility. From time to time, we replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes and equity, or alternative securities. We may selectively utilize capital market transactions in furtherance of our investment strategy.
Business Strategy
We are focused on building and maintaining a portfolio of high-quality health care properties leased to physicians, hospitals, health care delivery systems, and other health care providers. Our investment strategy includes a focus on investments with the following key attributes:
•We seek to invest in properties occupied by health care systems with dominant market share and high credit quality and in those who are investing capital into their campuses. In particular, we seek to acquire off-market or selectively marketed assets with attractive demographics, economic growth, and high barriers to entry. We seek to own well-occupied properties that we believe are critical to the delivery of health care and which are off-campus but affiliated with a hospital. 
•We emphasize ensuring an appropriate and balanced mix of tenants to provide synergies within both individual buildings and the broader health system campus. Our primary tenants are health care systems, academic medical centers, and leading physician groups. These groups typically have strong and stable financial performance. We believe this helps ensure stability in our rental income and tenant retention over time.
•We seek to maintain a core, critical portfolio of properties and to build our reputation as a dedicated leading MOB owner and operator.
•We seek to maintain or increase our average rental rates, focus on actively leasing our vacant space, and reduce leasing concessions.
We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound health care providers and health care delivery systems that offer need-based health care services in sustainable health care markets and consider the potential for long-term relationships and repeat business when assessing acquisition potential.
We actively manage our balance sheet to maintain our investment grade credit rating, to maintain an appropriate level of leverage, and to preserve financing flexibility for funding of future acquisitions. In particular, we:
•Seek to maintain a high level of liquidity, including borrowing availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
•Maintain access to multiple sources of capital, including private debt issuances, public bond offerings, public equity offerings, unsecured bank loans, and equity from joint venture partners.
•Periodically review our portfolio to consider the potential dispositions of lower quality properties to reinvest the proceeds into higher quality properties.
•Closely monitor our existing debt maturities, average interest rates, and look for refinancing opportunities.
Sustainability Strategy
Since our founding in 2013, the Company has established a track record of environmental stewardship, value creation at the community level, and strong governance. We are also committed to increased transparency and accountability through public disclosure. We believe that sustainable investments are investments in a brighter future, and we are committed to being a leader in Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) performance within the REIT industry. Our ESG Committee, formed in 2018, is overseen by the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Trustees and each major department is represented within this group. In 2020, we released our first inaugural annual ESG report.
As a result of our commitment to sustainability, we have been recognized with eight Institute of Real Estate Management Certified Sustainable Property (“IREM® CSP”) designations in 2019 and ten IREM® CSP designations in 2020. In addition, we have incorporated green lease language into nearly all of our new leases and renewals, aligning our financial and energy incentives with our tenants. This has resulted in recognition by the Institute for Market Transformation (“IMT”) as a Green Lease Leader in 2020. Our portfolio also includes three LEED-certified properties, and DOC has been an Energy Star Partner since 2015.
Climate Resilience
We are focused on climate preparedness as part of our sustainability strategy. As a long-term owner and active manager of our assets, we are proactive in identifying climate risks and implementing preventive measures to combat these risks. Responsibility for these measures is distributed across several departments including Executive Leadership, Asset Management, Construction & Project Management, Leasing, Marketing, and Property Management. In 2020, we began work to implement the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (“TCFD”), and the aforementioned team is assessing our climate related risk and intends to report in alignment with TCFD in our annual ESG report.
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) 
The Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by SASB in 2018 proposes sustainability accounting metrics designed for disclosure in mandatory filings, such as Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report, and serves as the framework against which we have aligned our disclosures for sustainability information. 
Energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters and assured by a third party. The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include: 
•energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area (“Energy Use Intensity”); 
•total energy consumed by portfolio area (“Total Energy Consumption”); 
•like-for-like change in energy consumption by portfolio area (“Like-for-Like Energy Change”); 
•water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area (“Water Intensity”); 
•total water withdrawn by portfolio area (“Total Water Consumption”); and 
•like-for-like change in water withdrawal by portfolio area (“Like-for-Like Water Change”). 
The charts below detail our Energy Use Intensity, Total Energy Consumption, Like-for-Like Energy Change, Water Intensity, Total Water Consumption, and Like-for-Like Water Change for 2018 through 2020 for which data on occupied and actively-managed properties was available.1
Our Industry and Market Opportunity 
The nature of health care delivery continues to evolve due to the impact of government programs, regulatory changes and consumer preferences. We believe these changes have increased the need for capital among health care providers and increased pressure on these providers to integrate more efficient real estate solutions in order enhance the delivery of quality health care. In particular, we believe the following factors and trends are creating an attractive environment in which to invest in health care properties.
$3.8 Trillion Health Care Industry Projected to Grow to $6.2 Trillion (and 19.4% of U.S. GDP) by 2028
According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), health care spending accounted for 17.7% of U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) in 2019. The general aging of the population, driven by the Baby Boomer generation and advances in medical technology and services which increase life expectancy, are key drivers of the growth in health care expenditures. The anticipated continuing increase in demand for health care services, together with an evolving complex and costly regulatory environment, changes in medical technology and reductions in government reimbursements are expected to pressure capital-constrained health care providers to find cost effective solutions for their real estate needs.
1 The charts reflect the performance of 4.5 million square feet, which is 32% of our portfolio and 44% of our managed portfolio. The energy scope includes energy produced from fuel, gas, and electricity. The water scope includes irrigation, domestic water, and sewer utilities. Data points in the Like-for-Like Change table above are measured against our 2018 benchmark.
We believe the demand by health care providers for health care real estate will increase as health care spending in the United States continues to increase. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ National Health Expenditure Projections 2019-2028, national health care expenditures continue to rise and are projected to grow from an estimated $3.8 trillion in 2019 to $6.2 trillion by 2028, representing an average annual rate of growth of 5.4%, reaching a projected 19.7% of GDP in 2028.

Aging Population
The aging of the U.S. population has a direct effect on the demand for health care as older persons generally utilize health care services at a rate well in excess of younger people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to more than double from 49.2 million to nearly 94.7 million, and the 85 and older population is expected to almost triple, from 6.4 million to 19.0 million, between 2016 and 2060. Also, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of older Americans is growing as a percentage of the total U.S. population with the number of persons older than 65 estimated to comprise 15.2% of the total U.S. population in 2016 and projected to grow to 23.5% by 2060.
We believe that health care expenditures for the population over 65 years of age will continue to rise as a disproportionate share of health care dollars is spent on older Americans. To illustrate, in 2012 the elderly (65+ years old) represented only 14% of the population while accounting for 34% of all health care-related spending. We believe the older population group increasingly will require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments and that this increased demand for health care services will create a substantial need for additional medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the health care industry in many regions of the United States. Additionally, we believe there will likely be a focus on lowering the cost of outpatient care for the aging U.S. population, which will continue to support medical office and outpatient facility property demand in the long term. For example, beginning in 2019, CMS expanded the list of procedures that can be performed and reimbursed in outpatient surgery centers to include 12 cardiac catheterization diagnostic procedures and 5 ancillary procedures. CMS expanded this list to include an additional 31 procedures between 2020 and 2021. We believe these trends will result in a substantial increase in the demand for health care space in our facilities and the number of properties meeting our investment criteria.
We believe advances in medical technology will continue to enable health care providers to identify and treat once fatal illnesses and improve the survival rate of critically ill and injured patients who will require continuing medical care in outpatient medical office buildings.

Affordable Care Act 
The Affordable Care Act (as hereinafter defined) constituted a significant overhaul of many aspects of health care regulations and health insurance and created new features in the framework for health care services over the near term. It required every American to have health insurance or be subjected to a tax. Those who cannot afford health insurance are offered insurance subsidies or Medicaid coverage. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate was unconstitutional. The Affordable Care Act remains law while appeals of this ruling continue.
The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 50 million Americans did not have health care insurance in 2009, before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The U.S. Census Bureau calculated that in 2019, approximately 26.1 million Americans did not have health insurance, continuing a trend after passage of the Affordable Care Act to reduce the number of uninsured. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation, executive orders and events, as well as their potential impact on our business, are discussed more fully under Item 1 - Business, under the caption “Certain Government Regulations.”
We believe an increase in the number of Americans with access to health insurance would result in an increase in physician office visits and an overall rise in health care utilization which in turn will drive a need for expansion of medical, outpatient, and smaller specialty hospital facilities. We also believe the increased dissemination of health research through media outlets, marketing of health care products, and availability of advanced screening techniques and medical procedures have contributed to a more engaged population of health care users and has created increased demand for customized facilities providing specialized, preventive and integrative health care services. With the growth of electronic health care information transmission, physician offices increasingly engage with patients through telehealth. Health care payors, including Medicare, are beginning to reimburse for telehealth services when medical information is transmitted and used between patients and physicians. Telehealth services have also expanded as a result of COVID-19 and the need for social distancing.
We further believe the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are designed to lower certain reimbursement amounts under Medicare and tie reimbursement levels to the quality of services provided will increase the pressure on health care providers to become more efficient in their business models, invest capital in their businesses, lower costs and improve the quality of care, which in turn will drive health care systems to monetize their real estate assets and create demand for new, modern and specialized facilities.
Clinical Care Continues to Shift to Outpatient Care
According to the American Hospital Association (the “AHA”), many procedures traditionally performed in hospitals, such as certain types of surgery, are increasingly moving to outpatient facilities driven by advances in clinical science, shifting consumer preferences, limited or inefficient space in existing hospitals, and lower costs in the outpatient environment. This continuing shift toward delivering health care services in an outpatient environment rather than a traditional hospital environment increases the need for additional outpatient facilities and smaller, more specialized and efficient hospitals. Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and others have shown that health care is delivered more cost effectively and with higher patient satisfaction when it is provided on an outpatient basis. Increasingly, hospital admissions are reserved for the critically ill, and less critical patients are treated on an outpatient basis with recuperation in their own homes. We believe health care market trends toward outpatient care will continue to push health care services out of larger, older, inefficient hospitals and into newer, more efficient and conveniently located outpatient facilities and smaller specialized hospitals. We believe that increased specialization within the medical field is also driving demand for medical facilities designed specifically for particular specialties and that physicians want to locate their practices in medical office space that is in or adjacent to these facilities.
Impact of BBA on Outpatient Care
Section 603 Assets: Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the “2015 BBA”) generally prohibits hospital outpatient departments (“HOPDs”) from charging preferential hospital outpatient department rates for Medicare patients treated in “off-campus” locations on or after January 1, 2017, potentially impacting their profitability. These preferential Medicare rates are only permitted if the hospital provides HOPD services in a building within 250 yards of the hospital’s main inpatient location. A hospital HOPD can be grandfathered by the 2015 BBA even if the location is outside the 250 yard distance. Under the statutory authority, an off-campus HOPD facility in existence as of November 2, 2015 can be “grandfathered” and can continue to be paid at the preferential HOPD rates, if, among other things, the hospital was billing HOPD services in that location on a HOPD basis as of November 2, 2015 and continues to provide those services in that location. On November 21, 2018, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”) issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2019, that eliminates the higher, Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) reimbursement rate for evaluation and management services provided by Grandfathered HOPD locations (the “Final Rule”). The Secretary, instead, will only reimburse for evaluation and management services at the lower, Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rate that new non-grandfathered off-campus HOPD locations receive. The AHA and a number of hospitals have sued the Secretary in federal court to enforce the plain meaning of Section 603 of the 2015 BBA and restore the right to Grandfathered HOPD reimbursement rates. On September 17, 2019, a federal district judge ruled in favor of the AHA. The court stated that CMS did not have the authority to lower payments for off-campus hospital-based departments that were grandfathered under the 2015 BBA. CMS challenged this ruling and requested a stay in the decision, which the court denied on October 21, 2019. In its December 15, 2020 final rule for hospital OPPS rates, CMS continued its efforts to lower payment for certain HOPD services basing reductions on the principle of “site neutrality.” These lower payment levels are effective January 1, 2021, notwithstanding the CMS’ projections that overall payments under OPPS will increase by 2.4%.“Grandfathered” hospitals providing HOPD services in our portfolio are referred to as 603 assets in our SEC reports and other public disclosures.
We own a number of assets that will continue to be reimbursed at hospital outpatient department rates, which we refer to as “603 assets” after the applicable section of the 2015 BBA. Rent derived from these 603 assets accounts for approximately 17% of our total consolidated portfolio annualized base rent as of December 31, 2020. Depending upon the implementation of the regulations and mix of procedures in an HOPD, the 2015 BBA may enhance the value of these 603 assets because existing HOPDs may lose their higher reimbursements rates should they choose to change locations, thus enhancing lease renewal probabilities and rent growth.
Portfolio Summary

Please see Item 2 - Properties for a table that summarizes our consolidated portfolio as of December 31, 2020.

Geographic Concentration

As of December 31, 2020, approximately 14.2% of our consolidated gross leasable area was derived from properties located in Texas. 
As a result of this geographic concentration, we are particularly exposed to downturns in the Texas economy or other changes in local real estate market conditions. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental, or competitive conditions in Texas could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results. In the event of negative economic or other changes in the Texas market, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, 
our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected. See the discussion under Item 1A - Risk Factors, under the caption, “Economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas in which we conduct business, and in particular Texas, and other areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
Customer Concentration

We receive substantially all of our revenue as rent payments from tenants under leases of space in our health care properties, with our five largest tenants based upon rental revenue representing approximately $62.0 million, or 20.3%, of the annualized base rent from our consolidated properties as of December 31, 2020. No one tenant represents more than 5.6% of our total consolidated annualized base rent; however, 16.7% of our total consolidated annualized base rent as of December 31, 2020 is from tenants affiliated with CommonSpirit Health. We have no control over the success or failure of our tenants’ businesses and, at any time, any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. Our business, financial position, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if CommonSpirit Health were to experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, or results of operations.
Competition

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of health care properties, including national, regional and local operators, acquirers, and developers of health care-related real estate properties and other investors such as private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The competition for health care-related real estate properties may significantly increase the price that we must pay for health care properties or other assets that we seek to acquire, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs that target health care properties may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, enhanced operating efficiencies, more personnel, and market penetration and familiarity with markets. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. Increased competition would result in increased demand for the same assets and therefore increase prices paid for them. Those higher prices for health care properties or other assets may adversely affect our returns from our investments.
We also face competition in leasing available MOBs and other facilities that serve the health care industry to prospective tenants. As a result, we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, offer other inducements, or we may be unable to timely lease vacant space in our properties, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
Seasonality

Our business has not been, and we do not expect it to become, subject to material seasonal fluctuations.

Human Capital Management

At December 31, 2020, we had 81 full-time employees, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are positive.
We believe that the success of our business depends on a strong, talented, and committed workforce to ensure excellence on behalf of our clients and shareholders. We prioritize the well-being of our team members and offer comprehensive benefits packages, opportunities for personal and group volunteer efforts, and paths for life-long learning to our employees. Our employees work with a variety of business units across the Company to diversify their skill sets and are offered challenging projects, stock ownership, and a collaborative environment with exposure to our top executives. In addition, our team members regularly participate in training courses on topics such as leadership, freedom from harassment through a positive work environment, and more. 
To represent our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DE&I”), we established a DE&I Council in 2019 that sets goals, develops educational platforms, and plans activities to promote DE&I at all levels of our organization. As part of our multi-year DE&I goals, we have developed a roadmap to recruit, retain, and support underrepresented populations within our company. Strategies include promoting the inclusion of diverse candidates in recruitment efforts, providing enhanced career development support for underrepresented populations, and ensuring that we continue to offer benefits and compensation that 
attracts and retains diverse team members. The DE&I Council is overseen by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees.
We have a strong commitment to team involvement in the workplace. Employees lead committees focusing on social, environmental, philanthropic, and health & wellness topics that shape the Company’s policies and drive positive change. We also conduct annual engagement surveys through third-party companies to provide anonymous team member feedback. We believe that continuous improvement and investment in our team is the key to our continued success. 
Environmental Matters

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties even if we no longer own such properties. See the discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning, leasing, developing and operating our properties may affect our results of operations.”
Certain Government Regulations
Overview

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local health care laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure, protection of patient health information, and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of health care facilities, and we expect that the health care industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, health care management, and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our health care properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “The health care industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure, or failure to obtain licensure could adversely impact our company and result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.”
In 2017, Congress came within a single vote of repealing of the Affordable Care Act and substantially reducing funding to the Medicaid program. New legislation may be introduced in the future, proposing changes, if not full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Beyond this, significant changes to commercial health insurance and government-sponsored insurance (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) remain possible. Commercial and government payors are likely to continue imposing larger discounts and tighter cost controls upon operators, through reductions in reimbursement rates and changes in payment methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise. A shift toward less comprehensive health insurance coverage and increased consumer cost-sharing on health expenditures could have a material adverse effect on certain of our operators’ liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases.
The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.

Health Care Legislation
Health Reform Laws. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the Affordable Care Act (collectively with other subsequently enacted federal health care laws and regulations, the “Health Reform Laws”). The Health Reform Laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties. Some provisions of the Health Reform Laws may have a positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues, by, for example, increasing coverage of uninsured individuals, while others may have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by, for example, altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities. The Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants, in the event of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws. In addition, there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective employees. The Health Reform Laws also provide additional Medicaid funding to allow states to carry out the expansion of Medicaid coverage to certain financially-eligible individuals beginning in 2014, and have also permitted states to expand their Medicaid coverage to these individuals since April 1, 2010, if certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allows states not to participate in the expansion-and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion-without losing their existing Medicaid funding. As of December 1, 2020, 12 states have pursued the option not to adopt the Medicaid expansion. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but could also further strain state budgets. While the federal government paid for approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states now are expected to pay for part of those additional costs.

Since the enactment of the Health Reform Laws, there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenge to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws, including the case that was before the U.S. Supreme Court, King v. Burwell. Although the Supreme Court in Burwell upheld the use of subsidies to individuals in federally-facilitated health care exchanges on June 25, 2015, which ultimately did not disrupt significantly the implementation of the Health Reform Laws, we cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal, amend or challenge the validity of all or part of the Health Reform Laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal, amendment or challenge would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us.
In 2017, former President Trump and Congress unsuccessfully sought to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order stating that it is the administration’s official policy to repeal the Affordable Care Act and instructing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authority and responsibility under the Affordable Care Act to, among other matters, delay implementation of or grant an exemption from any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, health care providers, health insurers, patients, and others. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. The Tax Act, among other things, reduces the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate penalty to zero beginning in 2019. The elimination of the penalties does not remove the requirement to obtain health care coverage; however, without penalties there effectively will be no enforcement. On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate was unconstitutional. The court also ruled that the provisions of the individual mandate were not severable from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act, rendering the remainder of the Affordable Care Act invalid as well. Following a series of appeals, the Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 10, 2020, with a decision expected in 2021. The law remains in place pending a final decision.
It is possible that Congress will continue to consider other legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act or repeal and replace some or all elements of the Affordable Care Act. In addition, Congress is considering authorization of significant additional funding for health care services to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
The US Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued a final rule on June 21, 2018 authorizing the creation of Association Health Plans (“AHP”). This rule was one of three components of a 2017 Executive Order to increase consumer health insurance options and also created short-term limited duration health insurance and health reimbursement arrangements. On March 28, 2019, the US District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the AHP. On April 26, 2019, the DOJ appealed that decision.
On June 24, 2019, former President Trump signed an Executive Order on Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Health Care to Put Patients First. The Order was intended to increase the availability of meaningful price and quality information for patients. CMS included in its final rule for Medicare hospital outpatient payment, the requirement that 

hospitals make public their standard charges, along with payer-specific negotiated rates, in a consumer-friendly format. This requirement was to be effective January 1, 2020. In 2019, the AHA and other hospital groups initiated litigation against DHHS/CMS to prevent implementation of this price transparency rule. The AHA was unsuccessful in challenging this rule which became effective January 1, 2021. The public availability of hospital charges may give patients information to select physician office-based care rather than in the hospital. 
We cannot predict the effect of Trump or Biden Executive Orders, the Tax Act’s 2019 repeal of the individual mandate penalty on the Affordable Care Act, or the Texas court’s decision or any appeal thereof, the decision on the AHP rule or any appeal thereof, other state-based litigation, or whether Congress’ attempt to change the law will be successful. Further, we cannot predict how the Affordable Care Act might be amended or modified, either through the legislative or judicial process, and how any such modification might impact our tenants’ operations or the net effect of this law on us. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by any repeal or modification of the law, our revenue and operations may be materially adversely affected as well.
Fraud and Abuse Enforcement

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing health care providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state health care programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of health care items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain health care services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of health care fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state health care programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state, and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws.
Reimbursement

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among other sources, governmental health care programs, such as the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance payors, managed care organizations (MCOs), health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). As federal and state governments focus on health care reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators.
We cannot predict whether future Congressional action will reduce physician reimbursements. Efforts by other payors to reduce health care costs are likely to continue, which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants. Further, revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. For example, payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. The Health Care Reform Laws and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government and private payments to health care providers. In some cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private health care insurance. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their ability to continue participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and other government sponsored payment programs. The financial impact on our tenants’ failure to comply with such laws and regulations could restrict their ability to make rent payments to us.
Health Care Licensure and Certificate of Need

Certain health care facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws, and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies and laboratories, handle radioactive materials, and operate equipment. Many states require certain health care providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion, and closure of certain health care facilities. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses.
COVID-19 Relief
The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the “CAA”) signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020 will expand or extend Medicaid and Medicare payment for health care providers and services beginning in 2021. The CAA extends and supplements certain health care provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), enacted on March 27, 2020. Among other changes, the CAA will moderate reductions in physician payment that were scheduled to start on January 1, 2021, making approximately $3 billion available for physician services. The CAA authorizes $1.4 trillion to fund federal agencies through 2021, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs at the national level. New patient protections will be established that restrict “surprise billing” by out-of-network health care providers and physicians and will restrict billing patients at higher rates than in-network providers.
