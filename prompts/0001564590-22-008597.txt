Benefitfocus solutions are based on a multi-tenant architecture and has a user-friendly interface designed for people to access all of their benefits in one place. Our comprehensive one-to-many model supports a broad line-up of benefits including core medical benefit plans; ancillary benefits, such as, dental, life, disability insurance, mental health and financial wellness; and a full array of voluntary benefits. Our platform includes functionality designed to help consumers identify and evaluate benefit options available to them. As the number of employer benefits plans has increased, with each plan subject to many different business rules and requirements, demand for Benefitfocus solutions is growing.
 Employers use our solutions to streamline benefits processes and control costs, keep up with challenging and ever-changing regulatory requirements, and offer a greater variety of benefit options to attract, retain and motivate employees. The Benefitfocus Platform enables our employer customers to manage complex benefits processes, from enrollment to ongoing administration engagement. It provides their employees with a highly intuitive and personalized user interface for selecting and managing all of their benefits via mobile or desktop device. 
 Health Plans, also known as health insurers, health insurance carriers or medical insurance carriers, use our solutions to more effectively market offerings to benefits-eligible employees, simplify billing, and improve the enrollment process. We also provide a large network of benefit provider data exchange connections, which facilitates the otherwise highly fragmented interaction among employees, employers, brokers and health plans. 
 Brokers use our platform to manage employer portfolios and individual clients. This includes delivering strategic, data-driven insights that improve their employer clients’ benefit experience while demonstrating greater value. In addition, brokers benefit from access to a larger set of relevant products and coverage for employers, which builds client goodwill and can often yield higher broker commissions and profits.
 Since our initial public offering, we have described our target market as comprising two separate but related market segments – employers and health plans. Within the employer market segment, we sell our technology solutions on an annually recurring or multi-year subscription basis to large employers, which we define as those with more than 1,000 employees. Similarly, in our other market segment, we sell our solutions on a subscription basis to health plans, enabling us to expand our overall footprint in the benefits marketplace by aggregating many key constituents, including consumers, employers, and brokers. We believe our presence in both the employer and health plan market segments gives us a strong position at the center of the benefits ecosystem. 
 Our solution offering includes a robust voluntary benefit solution, known as Benefit Catalog . As the popularity of voluntary benefits has increased rapidly in the past few years, we designed a marketplace to provide brokers, carriers and employers with access to a best-in-class portfolio of benefit designs and options. This marketplace is designed to enable greater access to more benefit options so individual employees and consumers can design and select coverages that are most appropriate for their individual needs. Through this voluntary benefits solution, Benefitfocus delivers employee/consumer education and access, data-driven analysis and modeling tools and operational efficiencies. By driving additional value, Benefitfocus is able to collect carrier commissions and/or fees based on the volume of products and coverages purchased on our platform. Carrier agreements have terms of two to four years and are typically cancellable upon breach of contract or insolvency. Supplier contracts have terms of one year or less and are generally cancellable upon breach of contract, failure to cure, bankruptcy and termination for convenience. 
 Our hybrid software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and repeatable transaction-based model provides us visibility into our future operating results, which enhances our ability to manage our business. Our company was founded in 2000, and we currently employ approximately 1,100 associates, or employees.
 Industry Background
 The administration and distribution of benefits to employees is a mainstay of the U.S. economy. Providing these benefits is costly and complex and requires the exchange of data and information, application of rules, and transfer of funds among a wide variety of constituents, including consumers, employers, insurance carriers, suppliers, brokers, benefits outsourcers, payroll processors, and financial institutions. The size of the human resources (“HR”) benefits administration market and the value of benefits transacted are large. According to IBISWorld calculations, the market for HR benefits administration in the United States was $66.0 billion in 2021. Eastbridge Consulting Group estimates the U.S. in-force premiums were $46.3 billion in 2020 for employee-paid life, health and disability products sold at the worksite with premiums paid through payroll.
 The variety and complexity of medical and non-medical benefits plans continues to grow. The Benefitfocus annual market research report, The State of Employee Benefits 2021, our most recent edition, indicates that a higher proportion of benefits offerings are shifting to high-deductible health plans coupled with health savings accounts. This added complexity places greater potential cost burden on employees and consumers and creates a greater need for employers to educate their workforces on becoming more informed health-care consumers. To help employees cover added cost burdens, employers are increasingly offering a wider range of non-medical benefits plans, such as critical illness, supplemental income and financial wellness programs, as well as traditional insurance offerings like dental, life and disability. Current point and legacy systems are inadequate to efficiently manage the complexity, regulation, and involvement of multiple parties. These systems are often incapable or inadequate in enabling the purchase of non-medical benefits. These factors are driving the need for an enterprise benefits management system and a consumer-focused platform to improve operational efficiency along the entire benefits value chain.

Employer Market
 A significant and growing portion of employers’ costs is non-salary benefits, such as health insurance, that they provide to their employees. With healthcare and other premiums increasing, senior executives are prioritizing benefits administration in their organizations and searching for ways to contain costs without sacrificing benefits. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics, healthcare and other employee benefits accounted for 29.2% of all employee labor costs in December 2021. In addition, the expense burden continues to shift to employees. Employees’ contributions to premiums for health insurance have grown from approximately $318 per employee in 1999 to approximately $1,299 per employee in 2021. Employers recognize the importance of offering a greater variety of non-medical benefits as a means to attract, motivate, and retain employees. They must maintain relationships with multiple insurance carriers and many other benefits providers, placing a substantial administrative burden on their organizations.
 Employers’ distribution, management, and administration of employee benefits has historically consisted of error-prone, paper-based processes, and a patchwork of customized software tools, which are costly to maintain, often lack necessary functionality, and fail to address the increasing complexity of the benefits marketplace. As benefits offerings become more complex and employees bear more of the cost of those benefits, HR software solutions that streamline information, simplify choices, and engage employees are increasingly in demand. Employees desire tailored, dynamic, and interactive communication of critical benefits information, with easy access to purchase benefits, as they become accustomed to receiving personalized content through various consumer applications on a range of devices.
 Legacy HR systems were generally designed as extensions of enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), systems, built for back-office responsibilities like finance and accounting. As a result, these systems lack functionality and ease-of-use for employees. Many legacy HR systems were not designed to integrate with the broader benefits ecosystem, including brokers, carriers, and wellness providers, or have the ability to transact non-medical benefits. This results in expensive, error-prone, and incomplete experiences for employers and employees. Benefits outsourcers have attempted to compensate for the shortcomings of legacy HR systems, but they have generally lacked adequate technology solutions necessary to keep up with the rapidly evolving benefits landscape. As a result, employees are often not provided with the appropriate functionality and information required to select and manage their benefits effectively.
 Modern technology, changing communication patterns, and a constantly evolving benefits ecosystem have impacted the employee-employer relationship. HR executives continue to search for effective strategies to increase efficiency and contain costs, while increasing employee engagement and being an employer of choice. Employers are increasingly interested in SaaS solutions that can help capture and analyze benefits data and provide more choice for their employees to improve productivity and satisfaction. In order to manage the distribution and administration of benefits effectively, employers need an integrated platform, capable of handling all benefits in one place and providing a highly personalized experience for employees.
 Health Plan Market
 The employee benefits market consists of a myriad of medical insurance carriers and products. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the single largest benefit provided to employees in the United States is healthcare insurance, often encompassing more than 90% of all insurance benefits spending by employers. 
 Large, national health insurance carriers also offer numerous individual health plans of different types, including health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, point-of-service plans, and high deductible health plans, across the 50 states, as well as life and ancillary benefits plans. Each carrier offers a complex variety of medical insurance and non-medical benefits, encompassing life and ancillary plans, with each plan requiring multiple decisions to address the specific needs of employers and their individual employees. Despite widespread carrier consolidation, numerous disparate systems remain in place, with many large health plans operating on multiple IT systems. Health plans often rely on manual processes and siloed software applications to bridge gaps in legacy administration systems. Even as they attempt to modernize and keep up with evolving industry practices and a changing regulatory landscape, health plans have difficulty connecting with the broader healthcare system.  
 The effective delivery and management of employee benefits depends on the timely, continuous exchange of accurate data among health insurance carriers, their employer customers, broker partners and individual members. Legacy benefits management systems often lack important functionality such as web and mobile self-service capabilities and real-time data exchange. Critical health plan processes, including member enrollment, billing and payments, communications, and retail marketing often have been under-optimized or neglected by legacy systems, and health plans have devoted significant internal resources to cover technology gaps. In addition, healthcare reform mandates and the rise of exchanges have increased focus on carriers’ retail distribution capabilities, which require additional investment.
 Governmental oversight, punctuated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA” or “ACA”), has led to an increasingly dynamic regulatory framework under which health benefits are delivered, accessed and maintained. Despite efforts to repeal and/or reform part or all of PPACA, we expect digital transformation of healthcare benefits to continue in the form of public and private exchanges – online marketplaces that allow insurance carriers to compete directly for new members. We expect private exchanges will be less rigid, promoting both health and non-health benefits, with substantially fewer rules around the types of benefits 
 6


offered. As medical insurance carriers continue to bolster their retail distribution capabilities, we believe they will require consolidation of technology solutions to improve operational efficiency and attract additional members through private exchanges.
 Benefitfocus Solutions 
 We provide a multi-tenant cloud-based benefits enrollment and management platform for employees, employers, health plans, suppliers, and brokers. The Benefitfocus Platform simplifies how organizations and individuals transact benefits. 
 We believe our solutions help employers and clients of brokers in the following important ways:
 Simplify benefits enrollment.    Our solutions are designed to reduce the complexity of benefits enrollment by integrating all plan information in one place and presenting it to employees in an organized and easy-to-understand manner. Employees shop and enroll using a highly intuitive and engaging consumer-oriented interface. 
 Reduce cost and increase return on investment.    Our solutions automate the benefits management process and reduce the cost associated with clerical errors and covering ineligible employees and dependents. Our solutions also include advanced analytics and insights that enable employers and employees to quickly gather, report, and forecast benefit costs.
 Attract, retain, and motivate employees.    Our solutions help employers attract, retain, and motivate top talent by delivering benefits information through a highly intuitive and engaging user interface. We believe that when employees understand the value of their benefits and have easy access to benefits, they are more likely to be satisfied with and engaged in their jobs.
 Streamline HR processes.    Our solutions eliminate the time-consuming and labor-intensive, often paper-based, processes associated with managing employee benefits plans, making HR professionals more efficient. Employers and HR professionals can efficiently enroll users or update information, and communicate or make changes to plans in real-time. 
 Integrate seamlessly with related systems.    Our solutions can be easily and securely integrated with a variety of related systems, including health plan membership and billing, payroll and HR, banking, and other third-party administration. We provide a network of benefit provider data exchange connections through industry standard interfaces that are configurable to accommodate a variety of needs. Our open architecture further extends our functionality by allowing third parties to develop and offer products and services on our platform. Our human capital management application programming interface, or API, replaces traditional file-based systems with an automated, real-time interface.
 Purchase non-medical benefits.    Our platform includes a holistic, multidimensional marketplace whereby carriers and suppliers sell non-medical, voluntary and specialty products to employees.  
We believe our solutions help insurance health plans and suppliers in the following important ways:
 Bolster retail distribution capabilities through marketplaces.    Our solutions help health insurance carriers and suppliers respond to an evolving marketplace in which retail distribution capabilities are increasingly important to attracting and retaining new members. Our platform offers health plans a lower cost direct sales channel to employer groups and individuals. We offer the ability to sell both healthcare and non-healthcare benefit products in an online shopping environment that serves as an alternative to government-sponsored public exchanges.
 Attract and maintain membership.    Our solutions allow carriers to maximize sales capacity and efficiency by communicating directly with their employer customers and individual members. 
 Reduce administrative costs.    The Benefitfocus Platform allows health plans to consolidate IT systems, automate and simplify various aspects of the benefits administration process, such as enrollment, plan changes, eligibility updates, and billing and payments, from one centralized location. 
 Facilitate real-time data exchange.    Our solutions simplify interactions and data exchange, and foster collaboration among carriers, suppliers, brokers, employers, employees and consumers. This allows health plans to rapidly tailor and offer new benefits packages.
 Our Growth Strategy
 We intend to strengthen our position as a leading cloud-based benefits enrollment and management platform for employers and health plans, working closely with brokers as partners in the ecosystem. Key elements of our growth strategy include the following:
 Expand our customer base.    We believe that our current customer base represents a small fraction of targeted users that could benefit from our benefit administration solutions. In order to reach new customers in our existing markets, we are methodically investing in our direct sales and marketing resources. In addition, we are extending our channel partnership strategies, including the development and expansion of existing relationships that foster organic growth opportunities through brokers and carrier partners.
 Further develop our partner ecosystem.    We believe we have a large opportunity to efficiently grow our customer base through our strategic partners. To increase the number of consumers on our platform, we have established strong relationships with key 
 7


participants in the benefits market, including, among others, SAP and SuccessFactors and other human capital management (“HCM”) providers, as well as being added to large broker preferred vendor panels. 
 Deepen our relationships with our existing customer base.    We firmly believe that service excellence is key to creating value for our customers, which allows us to deepen our relationship with customers. We are deepening our employer relationships by continuing to provide a growing list of additional solutions to manage increasingly complex benefits processes. We are expanding our customer relationships through the upsell of additional software products and the delivery of new and innovative solutions like Covid tracking capabilities and Rx Insights.
Extend our suite of applications and continue our technology leadership.    We are extending the number, range, and functionality of our benefits solutions. We have extended the functionality of our products through mobile solutions. We intend to continue our collaboration with customers and partners so we can respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative capabilities that support our leadership position.
 Facilitate the inclusion and integration of voluntary benefits.    We believe we have a significant opportunity to drive higher employer satisfaction via the delivery of Benefit Catalog products. As part of the process, we increase consumer education and engagement and facilitate the purchasing of Benefit Catalog products throughout an entire calendar year. We also believe that our current Benefit Catalog portfolio of products will grow in number as we continue to advance our multidimensional marketplace.
 Target new markets.    We believe substantial demand for our solutions exists in markets and geographies beyond our current focus. We intend to leverage opportunities we believe will arise from the complexities of changing government regulation and increased enrollment impacting both Medicare and Medicaid. 
 Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions and investments.    We might pursue acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses and technologies that align with our overall growth strategy, and disciplined capital allocation process. We believe that a selective acquisition and investment strategy could enable us to gain new customers, accelerate our expansion into new markets, and enhance our product capabilities.

Technology Infrastructure and Operations
As an enterprise cloud software vendor, we have always deployed our solutions using a SaaS model. Our customers access our software via application integrations, web browsers, and/or mobile devices, rather than by installing software on their premises. Through our multi-tenant architecture, our customers access a single software instance with multiple possible configurations enabled by our metadata-driven framework. The multi-tenant approach provides significant operating economies through aligned, shared computational services and processes as it helps us to reduce our fixed cost base and minimize unused capacity on our hardware. In addition, our software architecture gives us an advantage over legacy system vendors, who may be using a less flexible architecture that would require significant time and labor expense to address varied capability needs.
 We host our applications and serve our customers from multiple, co-located, private cloud data centers in separate locations. We rely on third-party vendors to operate these data centers, which are designed to host mission-critical computer systems and have industry-standard measures in place to minimize service interruptions. Our technical operations staff manages the technology stacks supporting the Benefitfocus Platform and uses automated monitoring tools throughout our system to detect unusual events or malfunctions that could interfere with our customers’ or partners’ use of the Benefitfocus Platform. We monitor application health by verifying that all applications, interfaces and supporting middleware are operational. If our monitoring detects anomalous situations, our dedicated network operations staff respond immediately to diagnose the situation, communicate status, and resolve the matter. We take the security of our data, systems and operations very seriously, and minimize risk at every level of technology selection through software architecture, systems administration, and operational controls and procedures.
 Compliance and Certifications 
 We obtain third-party examinations of our controls relating to security. Certain examinations are conducted under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements, or SSAE, No. 18 (Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization). In particular, we obtain Service Organization Controls, or SOC, reports known as SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II audits that test the design and operating effectiveness of controls over a period of time. An independent auditor conducts these examinations annually and addresses, among other areas, our physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability, confidentiality, privacy, change management, and logical security. On an annual basis, a data security and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) compliance risk assessment are also performed.
 On an annual basis, we complete an independent assessment by a qualified security assessor (“QSA”) of compliance against the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS” or “PCI”), applicable to Level 1 service providers. These standards focus on application and network security controls for companies that transmit and store credit card data on behalf of clients. Benefitfocus meets PCI compliance requirements as a Level 1 service provider and submits its Report on Compliance and Attestation of Compliance documenting this assessment to the three major credit card brands annually.
 Competition
 While we do not believe any single competitor offers similarly expansive benefits administration solutions, we face competition from various sources, many of which have greater resources than us. We have historically described our competition in our two market segments, employer and health plan. We believe that sources of competition encompass:

• | ERP software companies offering a cloud-based benefits administration software solution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HR outsourcing companies;
--+--------------------------


• | payroll service providers who expanded their core payroll services to include some form of cloud-based benefits administration services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | insurance carriers that have invested in internally developed benefit management solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | member services companies, including those providing web-based subscriber enrollment and claims adjudication services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | brokers and consultants who have influence over benefits offerings; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | various niche software vendors.
--+--------------------------------

 We believe that competition for benefits administration solutions is based primarily on the following factors:
  
• | capability for customization through configuration, integration, security, scalability, and reliability of applications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | competitive and understandable pricing;
--+----------------------------------------


• | breadth and depth of application functionality;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | access to broad offering of non-medical benefits;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | extensive data exchange network;
--+---------------------------------

 12



 
• | cloud-based delivery model;
--+----------------------------


• | dynamic communication capabilities with contextual media, animation, and acknowledgement tools;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | domain expertise in benefits and healthcare consumerism;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | extensive base of rules and event-driven benefit eligibility and enrollment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | accessible on any browser or mobile device;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | modern and adaptive technology platform;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | clearly defined implementation timeline;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | customer-branding and styling;
--+-------------------------------


• | delivering to customers service excellence;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | data exchange standardization; and
--+-----------------------------------


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer and legislative needs rapidly.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete effectively based upon all of these criteria, and that we are likely to continue to retain a high percentage of our customers from year to year. Nonetheless, we believe that the increasing acceptance of automated solutions in the healthcare marketplace and the adoption of more sophisticated technology and continuing legislative reform will result in increased competition, including potentially from large software companies with greater resources than ours. Other companies might develop superior or more economical service offerings that our customers could find more attractive than our offerings. Moreover, the regulatory landscape might shift in a direction that is more strategically advantageous to competitors.
 Research and Development 
 Our ability to compete depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features, and functionality. We deliver multiple software releases per year, updating the Benefitfocus Platform to leverage advances in cloud computing, mobile applications, and data management. Our research and development team is responsible for the design and development of our applications. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development using modern programming languages, agile development methodologies, data storage systems, and other tools. We use both commercial and open source products, following a “best tool for the job” philosophy in product selection. Our software has a multi-tiered architecture that ensures flexibility to add or modify features quickly in response to changing market dynamics, customer needs, or regulatory requirements.
 Our research and development expenses were $44.7 million, $46.2 million and $54.7 million for the years December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, and technical measures to protect the intellectual property used in our business. We generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our associates, consultants, vendors, and customers. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information.
 We use numerous trademarks for our products and services, and “Benefitfocus”, “Benefitfocus BenefitPlace”, “One Place”, “Benefitfocus For Life”, “BenefitPlace”, “All Your Benefits. One Place.”, and “All Your Benefits. In Your Pocket.” are registered marks of Benefitfocus in the United States. Through claimed common law trademark protection, we also protect other Benefitfocus marks which identify our services, and we have reserved numerous domain names, including “benefitfocus.com”. We also have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications in foreign jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, Ireland, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.
 We have been granted seven U.S. patents and all our patents are for utility patents. Our patents provide protections up to 2034. We also have three Chinese, two Australian, two Japanese, two Taiwanese R.O.C., two Hong Kong, and one Canadian patents. 
 We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties. Although we believe that alternative technologies are generally available to replace such licenses, these third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.
 Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
 13


The steps we have taken to protect our copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and the potential exists that third parties could infringe, misappropriate, or misuse our intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm our reputation and adversely affect our competitive position or operations. In addition, laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same manner as the United States. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as our company expands outside of the United States.
 Government Regulation 
 Introduction
 The employee benefits industry is required to comply with extensive and complex U.S. laws and regulations at the federal and state levels. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws, and we may be impacted by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. For some of these laws, there is little history of regulatory or judicial interpretation upon which to rely.
Changes in Healthcare Regulation and Markets
 Our business could be affected by changes in healthcare spending. PPACA and subsequent laws and regulations regarding the market for healthcare services have changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. PPACA, as enacted, expanded coverage of uninsured individuals by requiring states to expand Medicaid coverage significantly and to establish health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance policies by individuals and small employers. The law also provided subsidies to states to create non-Medicaid plans for certain low-income residents. 
 The requirement for states to expand Medicaid was repealed, and insurers initially experienced mixed results providing services through the exchanges, leading many to exit this market. Increased volatility following the repeal of the individual mandate also created uncertainty in the exchange markets. Notwithstanding, the Biden administration has indicated that it intends to build on PPACA, and has repealed many of the executive orders issued under the Trump administration intended to weaken the law and limit its reach. While many of the provisions of PPACA are not directly applicable to us, the law affects the business of many of our customers. Carriers and large employers might experience changes in the numbers of individuals they insure as a result of Medicaid expansion and volatility within state and national exchanges. 
 A significant goal of PPACA and subsequent reform efforts has been to move away from fee for service payments toward capitated payments to make providers more accountable for the cost and quality of care provided. Following the creation of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, for instance, Medicare and many commercial third party payors began implementing accountable care models in which groups of providers known as Accountable Care Organizations ("ACO") assume some amount of risk for the cost of care provided to certain groups of individuals. Also, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) continues to test demonstration programs to bundle acute care and post–acute care reimbursement to hold providers accountable for costs across a broader continuum of care. These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in public and commercial health plans, and will likely impact the business of our customers.
 Requirements Regarding the Confidentiality, Privacy and Security of Personal Information
 HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. Numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations apply to the privacy and security of personal health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of protected health information. Health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and most healthcare providers are considered "Covered Entities" subject to HIPAA. 
 With respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse, we are directly subject to the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule and the Breach Notification Rule. In addition, our health plan customers, or payors, are considered to be Covered Entities and are required to enter into written agreements with us, known as Business Associate Agreements, under which we are considered to be a Business Associate and that require us to safeguard protected health information and restrict how we may use and disclose such information. The Privacy Rule extensively regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information by Covered Entities and their Business Associates. For example, the Privacy Rule permits Covered Entities and their Business Associates to use and disclose protected health information for treatment and to process claims for payment, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the individual or must meet an exception specified under the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule also provides patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used and disclosed. To the extent permitted by the Privacy Rule and our contracts with our customers, we may use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, such as creating de-identified information. Determining whether data has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the Privacy Rule and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. The Security Rule requires Covered Entities and their Business Associates to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored.
 14


If we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. Further, if we fail to comply with the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, or Breach Notification Rule while acting as a Covered Entity or Business Associate, we could face civil penalties of up to $60,226 per violation ($1,806,757 per violation if not timely corrected) and a maximum civil penalty of $1,806,757 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement, in addition to criminal penalties. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights actively enforces the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule. Additionally, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents. 
 There are additional privacy and data security legal regimes at the federal and state level. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), regularly brings privacy and data enforcement actions under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, alleging that certain activities constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices. The states have similar laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive trade practices. There are also state data security laws and state laws that regulate the use and disclosure of health information, among others. Further, by regulation, the FTC’s Red Flags Rule requires some financial institutions and creditors, which may include some of our customers, to implement identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with customer accounts. We may be required to apply additional resources to our existing processes to assist our affected customers in complying with this rule. 
 We have implemented and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards, including written policies and procedures, intended to protect personal information, including protected health information, and have processes in place to assist us in complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and properly responding to any data breaches or incidents.
 Data Breach Notification Laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that generally require notice to affected individuals, regulators, and sometimes the media or credit reporting agencies in the event of a data breach impacting personal information. For example, at the federal level, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule mandates notification of breaches affecting protected health information to affected individuals and regulators under conditions set forth in the Rule. Covered Entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a Covered Entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Business Associates must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to Covered Entities within 60 days of discovery of the breach by the Business Associate or its agents. All states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted data breach notification laws. While some of these breach notification laws contain an exception for entities subject to HIPAA, other laws do not, and may impose notification obligations in addition to, or inconsistent with, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule when a data breach implicates protected health information.   
HIPAA Administrative Simplification
 HIPAA also mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain healthcare claims and payment transactions. These regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry and apply directly to Covered Entities. Some of our businesses, including our healthcare clearinghouse operations, are considered Covered Entities under HIPAA and its implementing regulations.
 Transaction Standards.    The standard transaction regulations established under HIPAA, or Transaction Standards, mandate certain format and data content standards for the most common electronic healthcare transactions, using technical standards promulgated by recognized standards publishing organizations. These transactions include healthcare claims, enrollment, payment and eligibility. The Transaction Standards are applicable to that portion of our business involving the processing of healthcare transactions among payors, providers, patients and other healthcare industry constituents. Failure to comply with the Transaction Standards may subject us to civil and potentially criminal penalties and breach of contract claims. The CMS is responsible for enforcing the Transaction Standards.
 Payors who are unable to exchange data in the required standard formats can achieve Transaction Standards compliance by contracting with a clearinghouse to translate between standard and non-standard formats. As a result, use of a clearinghouse has allowed numerous payors to establish compliance with the Transaction Standards independently and at different times, reducing transition costs and risks. In addition, the standardization of formats and data standards envisioned by the Transaction Standards has only partially occurred. However, PPACA requires HHS to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. We cannot provide assurance regarding how the CMS will enforce the Transaction Standards. We have modified our systems and processes to implement the Transaction Standards and we continue to work with payors, healthcare information system vendors and other healthcare constituents to maintain our implementation of the Transaction Standards.
 Health Plan and Other Entity Identifiers.    HHS has promulgated regulations implementing the establishment of a unique health plan identifier (“HPID”). Similar to a provider’s national provider identifier, the HPID provides an identification system for health plans to use for electronic transactions. HHS has also promulgated regulations implementing an Other Entity Identifier (“OEID”), that serves as an identifier for entities that are not health plans, healthcare providers or individuals. These other entities, which include third-party administrators, transaction vendors, and clearinghouses, are not required to obtain an OEID, but they could obtain and use one if they 
 15


needed to be identified in standardized transactions. The implementation of the enforcement of the HPID and OEID process has been indefinitely delayed by HHS, and if implemented its impact on our business is unclear at this time.
 Financial Services Related Laws and Rules
 Financial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards, some of which might impact our operations and subject us, our vendors and our customers to liability as a result of the payment distribution and processing solutions we offer. Although we do not act as a bank, we offer solutions that involve banks, or vendors who contract with banks and other regulated providers of financial services. As a result, we might be impacted by banking and financial services industry laws, regulations and industry standards, such as licensing requirements, solvency standards, requirements to maintain the privacy and security of nonpublic personal financial information and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance limits. In addition, our patient billing and payment distribution and processing solutions might be impacted by payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with applicable payment processing rules or requirements, we might be subject to fines and changes in transaction fees and may lose our ability to process credit and debit card transactions or facilitate other types of billing and payment solutions. Moreover, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing House Network (“ACH”), are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association and to various federal laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic funds transfers, and these rules and laws might impact our billing and payment solutions. Further, our solutions might impact the ability of our payor customers to comply with state prompt payment laws. These laws require payors to pay healthcare claims meeting the statutory or regulatory definition of a “clean claim” within a specified time frame.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,100 employees, who we refer to as associates. None of our associates are represented by a labor union or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We are not involved in any material disputes with any of our associates, and we consider our current relations with our associates to be good. All of our associates are located in the United States.  
 We believe our associates are our greatest asset. We are committed to designing a culture and environment that empowers our associates to thrive in their professional and personal lives. Our culture is one in which we want everyone to feel as if they belong and can be successful. We believe our corporate culture provides an advantage in recruiting new employees and retaining our best talent, as well as driving behaviors across our entire organization that help us succeed.
 Our mission is to improve lives with benefits and starts with our associates. We support the total wellbeing of our associates through targeted programs, products and community initiatives. Our associates have access to an innovative total rewards package, to help them to flourish, thrive and prosper.
 We offer a package of benefits to our associates so they can engage with benefits designed to protect and improve their total wellbeing, such as:
  
• | Essential core benefit offering in medical, dental and vision, with an annual contribution to the associate’s health savings account and the opportunity to personalize their benefit options to meet a diverse set of needs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Company-sponsored health and wellness programs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | A wide variety of curated voluntary benefits that help foster peace of mind.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Associates can develop resiliency and find support that fosters work-life balance through programs, adaptive skill-building and positive experiences, including:
  
• | Company-sponsored emotional health programs with caregiving support, employee assistance program and health advocacy services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A paid leave program; and
--+--------------------------


• | Company-sponsored disability benefits;
--+---------------------------------------

 Associates can build future financial security while being equipped for growth and success, including through our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan with Company match, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), and grants of equity awards to every full-time associate.
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our workforce. Most of our associates have worked remotely since March 2020. We responded by establishing a team charged with considering and implementing strategies and policies to support our associates in this new environment. We also communicate frequently with associates to share and reinforce governmental recommendations and guidelines for safely navigating the pandemic.
 16


We have a number of resources to support associates to thrive both professionally and personally including training and development programs, leadership programs, performance management, and regular engagement surveys that encourage open-ended feedback. 
 Benefitfocus is committed to providing a diverse and inclusive workplace in which equality, representation and respect create a culture of belonging. We believe our collective experiences make us stronger. We strive to be a place where everyone respects one another, regardless of national origin, race, color, gender, gender identity or expression, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or disability. As part of this commitment, we have established a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council with a charter and executive sponsorship. We are committed to our mission to improve lives with benefits, and we are equally committed to embrace the diversity and uniqueness of everyone to move this mission forward.
