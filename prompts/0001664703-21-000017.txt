ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
Bloom Energy created the first large-scale, commercially viable solid oxide fuel-cell based power generation platform that provides clean and resilient power to businesses, essential services, and critical infrastructure. Our technology, invented in the United States, is the most advanced thermal electric generation technology on the market today. Our fuel-flexible Bloom Energy Servers can use biogas and hydrogen, in addition to natural gas, to create electricity at significantly higher efficiencies than traditional, combustion-based resources. In addition, our fuel cell technology can be used to create hydrogen, which is increasingly recognized as a critically important tool necessary for the full decarbonization of the energy economy. Our enterprise customers are among the largest multi-national corporations who are leaders in adopting new technologies. We also have strong relationships with some of the largest utility companies in the United States and the Republic of Korea. 
At Bloom, we look forward to a 100% zero-carbon future, and our fuel-flexible technology offers one of the most reliable electricity solutions for a world facing unacceptable levels of power disruptions. Our resilient platform has kept electricity on for our customers through hurricanes, earthquakes, forest fires, extreme heat and grid failures. Unlike traditional combustion power generation, our platform is community-friendly and designed to create little-to-no harmful air pollutants. We have made tremendous progress making renewable fuel production a reality through our biogas, hydrogen and electrolyzer programs, and we believe that we are well-positioned to be a core platform and a fixture in the new energy paradigm.
Our team has decades of experience in the various specialized disciplines and systems engineering concepts embedded in our technology. We have 270 issued patents in the United States and 129 issued patents internationally as of December 31, 2020.
The United States is currently our biggest market and installed base of Bloom Energy Servers. Some of our largest customers in the United States include AT&T, Caltech, Delmarva Power & Light Company, Equinix, The Home Depot, Kaiser Permanente, and The Wonderful Company. We also work with a number of U.S. financing partners, who purchase our systems and deploy the systems at end-customers’ facilities in order to provide the electricity as a service. 
Outside of the United States, the Republic of Korea is a world leader in the deployment of fuel cells for utility-scale electric power generation, with approximately 550 megawatts deployed there. We entered this market with a first deployment of an 8.35 megawatts Bloom Energy Server solution for a Korean utility that began commercial operation in 2018, and Republic of Korea now represents our second-largest market, with more than 200 megawatts of Bloom Energy Servers under contract. SK Engineering and Construction (“SK E&C”), a subsidiary of the SK Group, serves as the distributor of our systems in the Republic of Korea. We are also operating smaller deployments in India and Japan with commercial customers and these markets are still developing. 
Industry Background
There are numerous challenges facing the traditional system for producing and delivering electricity. We believe these challenges will be the foundation of a transformation in how electricity is produced, delivered, and consumed. We believe this transformation will be similar to the seismic shifts seen in the computer and telecommunications industries, where centralized mainframe computing and landline telephone systems' ultimately gave way to the ubiquitous and highly personalized distributed technologies seen today, as well as the reimagining of business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements in the digital age.
Resilience is now a strategic imperative. The rising frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather in recent years underscores a critical need for greater grid resilience. 2020 was a year characterized by unpredictability. In the United States, as hurricanes, winter storms, and fires swept the country, the year saw the single greatest number of billion-dollar natural disasters since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began tallying disaster costs. Natural disasters in 2020 resulted in $95 billion in damages, and resulted in widespread power outages that left individuals and businesses in the dark for days, and even weeks, on end. These climate threats are compounded by an increasing concern over the threat of cyber-attack and physical sabotage to the centralized grid infrastructure. Stakeholders across industries grapple with the question of how to prepare for more intense natural disasters, while still maintaining course toward achieving their climate targets. This has elevated the discussion around the essential role that distributed generation and microgrids can play in improving the resilience of both businesses and the grid. As outages increase, businesses are considering the “cost of not having power” instead of just the “cost of power.” Energy resilience is becoming an issue business leaders can no longer afford to neglect – both from a 
strategic and cost perspective. In a climate change era, power availability and quality concerns are now reaching a company’s executive leadership team and their board of directors, no matter the industry.
Rise in centralized capacity constraints. With millions of people still working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme temperatures on the rise, and growing electric vehicle fleets that are only expected to increase in use over the coming decade, the centralized grid is challenged to meet the energy needs of businesses and customers. It is one of the many reasons why microgrids, localized energy systems that can operate alongside a main grid or disconnect and operate autonomously, are playing an increasingly important role, providing a critical, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week ("24x7"), always-on energy solution, powering critical infrastructure, offsetting demand on the grid, and supplying power to the grid when it is most needed. 
Increasing focus on reducing harmful local emissions. Air pollution is the fifth leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. Indeed, calculations of the economic and health benefits associated with reducing nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions have been found to exceed the economic and health benefits of reducing carbon emissions. And, unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has only further shed light on these detrimental health impacts. Recent studies have linked long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 death rates. They have also found that, nationwide, low-income communities of color are exposed to significantly higher levels of pollution, experiencing higher levels of lung disease and other ailments as a result. Policymakers are rightly increasing the emphasis on reducing such harmful local emissions as they consider the adoption of renewable portfolio standards or mandated targets for low- or zero-carbon power generation.
Hydrogen is key to a zero-carbon future. Hydrogen will be a critical foundation for the energy industry of the future, a truly clean alternative for both natural gas and transportation fuels. Hydrogen’s unique advantages - high energy density, zero greenhouse gas emissions from consumption, and ease of storage and transportation – make it an especially attractive investment opportunity for those interested in a zero-carbon energy mix. Given the well-documented challenges that utilities and grid operators have faced as they integrate increasingly intermittent renewable resources on the grid, predictable round-the-clock hydrogen power will be an invaluable resource as more grids move towards a truly zero-carbon resource mix. The key limiting factor in the use of hydrogen, which does not exist in nature as a separate molecule, is that it cannot be mined, extracted or otherwise produced in its desired state without a manufacturing process. As both transportation and the electricity sector transition to a zero-carbon future, there will thus be increasing demand for both technologies that can efficiently generate power using hydrogen, and for large-scale electrolysis or carbon capture technology that can produce clean hydrogen at scale.
Lack of access to affordable and reliable electricity in developing countries. In developing countries, the lack of adequate capital for upfront investment presents a significant barrier to the development of the type of resilient centralized grid system that modern life demands. However, those parts of the world that currently lack widespread access to electricity are also in a position to develop generation and delivery infrastructure that avoids the weaknesses and deficiencies that centralized systems in the United States and other industrialized countries have begun to show. We believe these countries are likely to develop hybrid solutions, consisting of both centralized and distributed electrical power infrastructure. Emphasizing the role of smaller, distributed resources in these systems can help accelerate the availability of power, and provide greater reliability to consumers.
Our Solution
The Bloom Energy Server delivers reliable, resilient, clean, and affordable energy, particularly in areas of high electricity costs, through its advanced distributed power generation system that is a customizable source of always-on, 24x7 baseload power.
Our fuel-flexible technology, which can use biogas and hydrogen, in addition to natural gas, is one of the most reliable electricity solutions for a world facing rising frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather and unacceptable levels of power disruption. Our resilient platform has kept electricity on for our customers through hurricanes, earthquakes, forest fires, extreme heat and grid failures, while uniquely addressing both the causes and consequences of climate change - optimizing air quality, water, land-use and resilience benefits for you and the communities you serve.
We believe we are uniquely positioned for the hydrogen future of tomorrow. The flexibility of our platform provides the capability to operate on hydrogen and a near-term commitment to scalable and cost-effective hydrogen solutions. Our scalable design is intended to enable both small- and large-scale solutions for both the power generation and transportation industry.
The Bloom Energy Server is based on our proprietary solid oxide fuel cell technology, which converts fuel into electricity through an electrochemical process without combustion. The primary input to the system is standard low-pressure natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen. The high-quality electrical output of our Energy Server can be connected to the customer’s 
main electrical feed, thereby avoiding the transmission and distribution losses associated with a centralized grid system. Each Bloom Energy Server is modular and composed of independent 50 kilowatt power modules. A typical configuration includes multiple power modules in a single Energy Server and can produce up to 300 kilowatts of power in a footprint roughly equivalent to that of half a standard 30-foot shipping container. Any number of these Energy Server systems can be clustered together in various configurations to form solutions from hundreds of kilowatts to many tens of megawatts. The Bloom Energy Server can be easily integrated into community environments due to its aesthetically attractive design, compact space requirement, minimal noise profile, and lack of local air pollutants. 
Our Value Proposition
Our value proposition has four key elements, which allow us to deliver a better electron: resiliency, sustainability, predictability and an energy platform. We seek to provide a complete, integrated “behind-the-meter” solution including installation, equipment, service, maintenance and, in limited cases, bundled fuel. The four elements of our value proposition emphasize those areas where there is a strong customer need and where we believe we can deliver superior performance.
Resiliency. Our Energy Servers avoid the vulnerabilities of conventional transmission and distribution lines by generating power on-site where the electricity is consumed. The system operates at very high availability due to its modular and fault-tolerant design, which includes multiple independent power generation modules that can be hot-swapped. Unlike traditional combustion generation, Bloom Energy Servers can be serviced and maintained without powering down the system. Importantly, our systems utilize the existing natural gas infrastructure, which is a redundant underground mesh network, intended to provide for extremely high fuel availability that is protected from the natural disruptions that affect the power grid.
Sustainability. In operation, our Energy Servers can uniquely address both the causes and consequences of climate change. Our projects lower carbon emissions by displacing less-efficient fossil fuel generation on the grid. We improve air quality, including in vulnerable communities, by generating electricity without combustion, offsetting combustion from grid resources as well as eliminating the need for dirtier diesel backup power solutions. Our microgrid deployments provide customers with critical resilience to grid instability resulting from climate-related extreme weather events. Our products achieve this while consuming no water during operation, with optimized land use as a result of our high power density. 
We are focused on product innovation, including the continued reduction of carbon emissions from our products, and we are engaged in multiple efforts to align our product roadmap with a zero-carbon trajectory. Already we are developing new applications and market opportunities in sectors with dirtier grids and higher marginal emissions displacement. We are focused on scaling use of renewable natural gas (“RNG”) – which is derived from biogas produced from decomposing organic waste from landfills, agricultural waste, and wastewater from treatment facilities – as fuel for our Energy Servers and building capacity within the market to further broader adoption. RNG is a biogas that has been upgraded to a quality similar to fossil natural gas and has a methane concentration of 90% or greater.
Additionally, we are pushing technology and business model boundaries to pioneer carbon capture and utilization & storage potential. Because carbon and nitrogen are not designed to mix in our Energy Servers, it is both feasible and cost-effective to capture carbon-dioxide emissions, which can be stored in underground geologic formations or utilized in new products or processes. Finally, our research and development efforts continue to focus on preparing our Energy Servers to utilize renewable hydrogen fuel, a 100% clean fuel, which is produced by breaking down water into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis. No new greenhouse gases should be produced when Energy Servers run on hydrogen, and using excess renewable capacity to create hydrogen would also help support further renewable adoption, compounding emissions benefits. 
We have announced applications and partnerships that leverage our platform in innovative ways. In 2020, we announced our intention to enter the commercial hydrogen market by introducing hydrogen-powered fuel cells and electrolyzers that produce renewable hydrogen. These products are intended to be first introduced to the South Korean market in 2021 through an expanded partnership with SK E&C. In November 2020, we won a competitive request in the Republic of Korea, with SK E&C, for a proposal under the RE100 global renewable energy initiative to supply 1.8 megawatts of hydrogen-powered fuel cells through a multi-stage deployment from late 2021 into 2022. The fuel cells are intended to be the cornerstone of a microgrid that also includes onsite solar and battery storage to an industrial complex. At the end of 2020, we shipped a 100 kilowatts hydrogen-powered Energy Server to the Republic of Korea as part of a pilot project in 2021.
Also in 2020, we forged a partnership with Samsung Heavy Industries to design and develop fuel cell-powered ships that will help us realize a vision of clean power for ships and a more sustainable marine shipping industry. With our distributed, always-on, non-combustion process of generating clean electricity, we are working every day to reduce emissions, build resilience and promote sustainable communities.
Predictability. In contrast to the rising and unpredictable cost outlook for grid electricity, we offer our customers the ability to lock in cost for electric power over the long-term. Unlike the grid price of electricity, which reflects the cost to maintain and update the entire transmission and distribution system, our price to our customers is based solely on their individual project. In the regions where the majority of our Energy Servers are deployed, our solution typically provides electricity to our customers at a cost that is competitive with traditional grid power prices. In addition, our solution provides greater cost predictability versus rising grid prices. Whereas grid prices are regulated and subject to frequent change based on the utility’s underlying costs, customers can contract with us for a known price in each year of their contract. Moreover, we provide customers with a solution that offers all of the fixed equipment and maintenance costs for the life of the contract.
Our Energy Servers deliver AlwaysOn, 24x7 baseload power with very high availability of power, mission-critical reliability and grid-independent capabilities. The Bloom Energy Server can be configured to eliminate the need for traditional backup power equipment such as diesel generators, batteries and uninterruptible power systems by providing primary power to a facility that seamlessly continues to deliver even when the grid fails. Our Energy Servers are designed to offer consistent power quality supply for mission critical operations that require a high level of electrical reliability and uninterrupted availability, such as data centers, hospital, and biotechnology. This is particularly important as society becomes more reliant on digital systems and sophisticated operational technology. Power quality issues can cause equipment failure, downtime, data corruption, and increased operational costs
Further, our Energy Servers were designed with ‘quick time to power’ as an important value proposition for customers that need to ramp up power quickly, providing peace of mind to businesses and communities that the power they need will be there when they need it most. They are designed to be deployed in a matter of days and are ideal for emergency management scenarios. The modularity, quick deployment, ease of installation, and small footprint of our Energy Servers facilitate ease of accessibility to power.
Energy Platform. Our Energy Servers are designed as a platform that can be customized to the needs of each customer to deliver a superior level of reliability, resiliency, sustainability and predictability. The fuel-flexibility of our platform provides an ability today to run on natural gas, biogas and hydrogen blends, and a near-term commitment to scalable and cost-effective 100% hydrogen solutions and zero emission power generation of the future. Our flexible and modular platform approach allows for personalization at the time of equipment commissioning and a pathway to upgrade existing systems to align with the sustainability goals of our customers over time.
Our Energy Server can be enhanced with AlwaysON Microgrid components to deliver higher levels of reliability and grid-independent operation. Customers can optimize their solution for mission-critical level, power quality solutions, such as in a data center application, to more basic outage protection, such as for a retail store. Customers also have a variety of choices for financing vehicles, contract duration, pricing schedules and fuel procurement.
Technology
The solid-oxide fuel cells in our Energy Servers convert fuel, such as natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen, into electricity through an electrochemical reaction without burning the fuel. Each individual fuel cell is composed of three layers: an electrolyte sandwiched between a cathode and an anode. The electrolyte is a solid ceramic material, and the anode and cathode are made from inks that coat the electrolyte. Unlike other types of fuel cells, no precious metals, corrosive acids or molten materials are required. These fuel cells are the foundational building block of our Energy Server. We combine a number of the fuel cells into a stack, and then combine a number of the stacks to form 50 kW power modules. Any number of these 50 kW power modules can be arranged in various configurations to form solutions that provide hundreds of kilowatts to many tens of megawatts of power. Regardless of the starting size of a solution, further scaling can be accomplished after the initial solution deployment, creating ongoing flexibility and scalability for the customer.
In a primary power configuration, our Energy Server is interconnected to the customer’s electric grid connection. By regulation, our Energy Server must be able to stop exporting power in case of a grid outage. However, Energy Servers can be upgraded to AlwaysON Microgrid solutions as add-on options at any point in time to enable continuous operation in the event of grid interruption. When in an always-on configuration, the Energy Server continually powers critical loads while the grid serves as a backup. Should there be a disruption to grid power, the critical load, which is already receiving primary power from the Energy Server, experiences no disruption. The combination of always-on power from our Energy Server, utilizing the natural gas infrastructure, and secondary feed from the independent electric grid is meant to result in a highly available and reliable solution.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization has addressed complex applied materials, processing and packaging challenges through the invention of many proprietary advanced material science solutions. Over more than a decade, Bloom has built a world-class team of solid oxide fuel cell scientists and technology experts. Our team comprises technologists with degrees in Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering and Nuclear Engineering, and includes 46 PhDs. This team has continued to develop innovative technology improvements for our Energy Servers. Since our first-generation technology, we have reduced the costs and increased the output of our systems through the next generation of our Energy Servers, and increased the life of our fuel cells by over two and half times.
We have invested and will continue to invest a significant amount in research and development. See our discussion of research and development expenses in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Competition
We primarily compete against the utility grid based on superior reliability, resiliency, cost savings, predictability and sustainability, all of which can be customized to the needs of individual customers. Customers do not currently have alternative solutions that provide all of these important attributes in one platform. As we are able to drive our costs down, we expect our economic value proposition to continue to improve relative to grid power in additional markets.
Other sources of competition – and the attributes that differentiate us – include:
•Intermittent solar power. Solar power is intermittent and best suited for addressing day-time peak power requirements, while Bloom provides stable baseload generation. Storage technology is intended to address the intermittency of solar power, but the low power density of the combined technologies makes the solution impractical for most commercial and industrial customers looking to offset a significant amount of power. As a point of comparison, our Energy Servers provide the same power output in 1/125th of the footprint of a solar installation, allowing us to serve far more of a customer’s energy requirements based on a customer’s available and typically limited space.
•Intermittent wind power. Power from wind turbines is intermittent, similar to solar power. Typically wind power is deployed for utility-side, grid-scale applications in remote locations but not as a customer-side, distributed power alternative due to prohibitive space requirements and permitting issues. Remote wind farms feeding into the grid do not help end customers avoid the vulnerabilities and costs of the transmission and distribution system.
•Traditional co-generation systems. These systems deliver a combination of electric power and heat from combustion sources. We believe we compete favorably because of our superior electrical efficiencies, significantly less complex deployment (avoiding heating systems integration), better performance on emissions and noise, superior availability, aesthetic appeal and reliability. Unlike these systems, which depend on the full and concurrent utilization of waste heat to achieve high efficiencies, Bloom can provide highly efficient systems to any customer based solely on their power needs.
•Traditional backup equipment. As our Energy Servers deliver always-on power, they can obviate the need for traditional backup equipment such as diesel generators. By providing combustion-free power 24x7 rather than just as backup, we generally offer a better integrated, more reliable, cleaner and cost-effective solution than these grid-plus-backup systems.
•Other commercially available fuel cells. Basic fuel cell technology is over 100 years old. Our Energy Server uses advanced solid oxide fuel cell technology which produces electricity directly from oxidizing a fuel. The type of solid oxide fuel cell we compete against has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte. The advantages of our technology include higher efficiency, long-term stability, elimination of the need for an external fuel reformer, ability to use biogas, natural gas, or hydrogen as a fuel, low emissions and relatively low cost. There are a variety of fuel cell technologies, characterized by their electrolyte material, including:
◦Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (“PEM”). PEM fuel cells typically are used in onboard transportation applications, such as powering forklifts, because of their compactness and ability for quick starts and stops. However, PEM technology requires an expensive platinum catalyst which is susceptible to poisoning by trace amounts of impurities in the fuel or exhaust products. These fuel cells require hydrogen as an input source of energy or an external fuel reformer, which adds to the cost, complexity and electrical inefficiency of the product. As a result, they are not an economically viable option for stationary baseload power generation.
◦Molten carbonate fuel cells (“MCFC”). MCFCs are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic matrix of beta-alumina solid electrolyte. The primary disadvantages of current MCFC technology are durability and lower electrical efficiency compared to solid oxide fuel cells. Current versions of the product are built for 300 kilowatt systems, and they are monolithic rather than modular. Smaller sizes are not economically viable. In many applications where the heat produced by these fuel cells is not commercially or internally useable continuously, mitigating the heat buildup also becomes a liability.
◦Phosphoric acid fuel cells (“PAFC”). PAFCs are a type of fuel cell that uses liquid phosphoric acid as an electrolyte. Developed in the mid-1960s and field-tested since the 1970s, they were the first fuel cells to be commercialized. PAFCs have been used for stationary power generators with output in the 100 kilowatt to 400 kilowatt range. PAFCs are best suited to combined heat and power output applications which require carefully matching and constant monitoring of power and heat requirements, often making the technology difficult to implement. Further disadvantages include low power density and poor system output stability.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an essential differentiator for our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property whenever possible. We rely upon a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws, along with employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
We have developed a significant patent portfolio to protect elements of our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2020, we had 270 issued patents and 69 patent applications pending in the United States, and we had an international patent portfolio comprising 129 issued patents and 46 patent applications pending. Our U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2023 and 2039. While patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or any single pending patent application. 
We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in some locations abroad. “Bloom Energy” and the “BE” logo are our registered trademarks in certain countries for use with Energy Servers and our other products. We also hold registered trademarks for, among others, “Bloom Box,” “BloomConnect,” “BloomEnergy,” and “Energy Server” in certain countries. In an effort to protect our brand, as of December 31, 2020, we had eight registered trademarks in the United States, 40 registered trademarks in Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and two pending applications in China. 
When appropriate, we enforce our intellectual property rights against other parties. For more information about risks related to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.
Manufacturing Facilities
Our primary manufacturing facilities for the fuel cells and Energy Servers assembly are in Newark, Delaware, and Sunnyvale, California. The 224,409 square-foot manufacturing facility that we own in Newark was our first purpose-built Bloom Energy manufacturing center and was designed specifically for copy-exact duplication as we expand, which we believe will help us scale more efficiently. Our Newark facility includes an additional 50 acres available for factory expansion and/or the co-location of supplier plants. Additionally, we lease various manufacturing facilities in California. Our current lease for our principal Sunnyvale manufacturing facility expires in December 2023, and our current lease for our manufacturing facility in Mountain View expires in April 2021. The facility in Mountain View will be replaced by a new R&D and manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. Both of our two principal manufacturing facilities are powered by Bloom Energy Servers.
In 2020, we established a light-assembly facility in the Republic of Korea and are developing a local supplier ecosystem through a new joint venture with SK E&C. Operations began in early July 2020, and are limited in scope and capacity.
Please see Part I, Item 2, Properties for additional information regarding our facilities.
Corporate Citizenship in 2020
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our Energy Servers have been delivering power to facilities around the globe that are providing essential services. We have deployed more than 20,000 fuel cell modules since our first commercial shipments in 2009, sending power to hospitals, healthcare manufacturing facilities, biotechnology facilities, grocery stores, hardware stores, 
banks, telecom facilities, and other critical infrastructure applications. We have deployed microgrids to pop-up and field hospitals handling COVID-19 patient overflow through contracts with both the State of California and the private sector. 
Early in the pandemic, as the United States faced a critical shortage of ventilators, a medical device used to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, we leveraged our expertise and capabilities in product end-of-life management to refurbish hundreds of out-of-service ventilators across the United States. We worked with state agencies and customers – many of which are hospitals and medical device companies – to identify supplies of unused, out-of-service ventilators for repair. To date, we have refurbished more than 1,300 ventilators across California, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.
In addition, as heat waves and wildfires engulfed California, we launched an initiative to export excess energy from our customers to the grid to provide relief to centralized capacity limitations in California.
Supply Chain
Our supply chain has been developed, since our founding, with a group of high-quality suppliers that support automotive, semiconductor and other traditional manufacturing organizations. The production of fuel cell systems requires rare earth elements, precious metals, scarce alloys and industrial commodities, Our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third-party services that require special manufacturing processes. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services except in cases where we have specialized technology and material property requirements. Our supply base is spread around many geographies in Asia, Europe and India, consisting of suppliers with multiple areas of expertise in compaction, sintering, brazing and dealing with specialty material manufacturing techniques. We responsibly source components like interconnects and balance of system components from various manufacturers on both a contracted and a purchase order basis. We have multi-year supply agreements with some of our supply partners for supply continuity and pricing stability. We are working with our suppliers and partners along all steps of the value chain to reduce costs by improving manufacturing technologies and expanding economies of scale.
Services
We provide operations and maintenance agreements ("O&M Agreements") for all of our Energy Servers, which are renewable at the election of the customer on an annual basis. The customer agrees to pay an ongoing service fee and in return we monitor, maintain and operate the Energy Servers systems on the customer's behalf. We currently service and maintain every installed Bloom Server worldwide.
As of December 31, 2020, our in-house service organization had 68 dedicated field service personnel distributed across multiple locations in both the United States and internationally. Our standard O&M Agreements include full remote monitoring and 24x7 operation of the systems as well as preventative maintenance, in terms of filter and adsorbents replacements and on-site part and periodic fuel cell module replacements.
Our two Remote Monitoring and Control Centers (“RMCC”) provide 24x7 coverage of every installed Bloom Energy Server worldwide. By situating our RMCC centers in the United States and India we are able to provide 24x7 coverage cost effectively and also provide a dual redundant system with either site able to operate continuously should an issue arise. Each Bloom Energy Server we ship includes instrumentation and a secure telemetry connection that enables either RMCC to monitor over 500 system performance parameters real time. This comprehensive monitoring capability enables the RMCC operators to have a detailed understanding of the internal operation of our power modules. Using proprietary, internally developed software, the RMCC operators can detect changes and override the onboard automated control systems to remotely adjust parameters to ensure the optimum system performance is maintained. In addition, we undertake advanced predictive analytics to identify potential issues before they arise and undertake adjustments prior to a failure occurring.
Our services organization also has a dedicated Repair & Overhaul ("R&O") facility, based in Delaware, in close proximity to our product manufacturing facility. This R&O facility undertakes full refurbishment of returned fuel cell modules with the capability to restore it to full power, efficiency and life with a less than three weeks turnaround.
Customer Financing
We assist our customers by providing innovative financing options that, in addition to aiding in customer purchases of our Energy Servers, provides us an expanded addressable customer base. We have developed multiple options for our customers who cannot purchase our Energy Servers on a direct purchase basis. 
Under the ‘Traditional Lease’ option, a customer may lease one or more Energy Servers from a financial institution that purchases such Energy Servers. In most cases, the financial institution completes its purchase from us immediately after 
commissioning. We both facilitate this financing arrangement between the financial institution and the customer and provide ongoing operations and maintenance services for the Energy Servers (such arrangement, a “Traditional Lease”). 
Alternatively, a customer may enter into one of two major types of service contracts with us for the purchase of electricity generated by the Energy Servers. The first type of services contract has a fixed monthly payment component that is required regardless of the Energy Servers’ performance, and in some cases includes a variable payment based on the Energy Servers’ performance (a “Managed Services Agreement”). Managed Services Agreements are then financed pursuant to a sale-leaseback with a financial institution (a “Managed Services Financing”). The second type of services contract requires the customer to pay for each kilowatt-hour produced by the Energy Servers (a “PPA”). PPAs have been financed through tax equity partnerships, acquisition financings, and direct sales to investors (each, a “Portfolio Financing”). 
For additional information about our different financing options, please see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Purchase and Lease Options.
Sales, Marketing and Partnerships
We market our Energy Servers primarily through a single direct sales organization supported by project finance, business development, government affairs, legal and regulatory, and marketing teams. In addition to our direct sales team, we work with multiple partners to generate customer leads and develop projects.
We sell our Energy Server platform through a combination of direct and indirect sales channels. At present, most of our sales are through our direct sales force, which is segmented by vertical and type of account. A large part of our direct sales force is now focused on our expansion efforts in the United States and creating new opportunities internationally. We are also expanding our relationship with utilities. We have developed a network of transactional energy advisors that bring new opportunities and referrals to Bloom, which has been a valuable source of high quality leads.
We pursue relationships with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce product advancement and acceleration of entry into new markets. The objectives and goals of these relationships can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, joint sales and marketing, or access to new geographic markets. SK E&C in the Republic of Korea is an example of a distribution partner and we are seeking additional strategic partners to fuel our international expansion.
Sustainability
Bloom Energy Servers produce clean, reliable energy without combustion that provide greenhouse gas, air quality, water, land-use and resilience benefits for its customers and the communities it serves. The innovative solid oxide fuel cell platform technology offers modular and flexible solutions configurable to address both the causes and consequences of climate change.
We are driven by the promise of our contribution to the transformation and decarbonization of energy and transportation sectors globally. We are working to make our technology available across a growing list of applications including biogas, carbon capture, hydrogen, marine and microgrid projects critical to aligning with a two degree warming trajectory. 
As a manufacturer, our commitment to sustainability is reflected not only through the impacts of our products in operation but also through our internal commitment to resource efficiency, responsible design, materials management and recycling. We endeavor to consistently increase our supply chain responsibility and approach to human capital management in ways that help us to continue to deliver products that add long-term societal value.
Permits and Approvals
Each Bloom Energy Server installation must be designed, constructed and operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, international and local regulations, codes, standards, guidelines, policies and laws. To operate our systems, we, our customers and our partners are required to obtain applicable permits and approvals from local authorities for the installation of Bloom Energy Servers and for the interconnection systems with the local electrical utility.
Government Policies and Incentives
There are varying policy frameworks across the United States and abroad designed to support and accelerate the adoption of clean and/or reliable distributed power generation technologies such as Bloom Energy Servers. These policy initiatives come in the form of tax incentives, cash grants, performance incentives, and/or specific gas or electric tariffs.
The U.S. federal government provides businesses with an Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, available to the owner of our Energy Server for systems purchased and placed into service. The credit is equal to 26% of expenditures for capital equipment and installation, and the credit for fuel cells is capped at $1,500 per 0.5 kilowatt of capacity. The credit will remain at 26% through 2022 and then step down to 22% in 2023. Under current law the credit is set to expire in 2024. 
Our Energy Servers are currently installed at customer sites in ten states in the United States, each of which has its own enabling policy framework. Some states have utility procurement programs and/or renewable portfolio standards for which our technology is eligible. Our Energy Servers currently qualify for tax exemptions, incentives or other customer incentives in many states including California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland and New York. These policy provisions are subject to change.
Although we generally are not regulated as a utility, existing and future federal, state, international and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. Federal, state, international and local governments continuously modify these statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. These changes can have a positive or negative impact on our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of electricity.
To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection agreements from the applicable local primary electricity and gas utilities. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are typically required once interconnection agreements are signed.
Product safety standards for stationary fuel cell generators have been established by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”). These standards are known as ANSI/CSA FC-1. Our products are designed to meet these standards. Further, we utilize the Underwriters' Laboratory, or UL, to certify compliance with these standards. Energy Server installation guidance is provided by NFPA 853: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Fuel Cell Power Systems. Installations at sites are carried out to meet the requirements of these standards.
Government Regulations
Our business is subject to a changing patchwork of environmental laws and regulations that prevail at the federal, state, regional, and local level as well as in those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Most existing environmental laws and regulations preceded the introduction of our innovative fuel cell technology and were adopted to apply to technologies existing at the time, namely large coal, oil, or gas-fired power plants. Currently, there is generally little guidance from these agencies on how certain environmental laws and regulations may or may not be applied to our technology. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury, fines, and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties or third-party damages. In addition, maintaining compliance with applicable environmental laws, such as the comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act in the United States, requires significant time and management resources.
At the federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has authority to regulate, under various federal energy regulatory laws, wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services, and the delivery of natural gas in interstate commerce. Some of our tax equity partnerships in which we participate are subject to regulation under FERC with respect to market-based sales of electricity, which requires us to file notices and make other periodic filings with FERC, which increases our costs and subjects us to additional regulatory oversight.
Several states in which we currently operate, including California, require permits for emissions of hazardous air pollutants based on the quantity of emissions, most of which require permits only for quantities of emissions that are higher than those observed from our Energy Servers. Other states in which we operate, including New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina, have specific exemptions for fuel cells. In addition, our project with Delmarva Power & Light Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to electricity generation, transmission, and sale in Delaware and at the federal level. 
Although we generally are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, and the rules surrounding the interconnection of customer-owned 
electricity generation for specific technologies. In the United States, governments frequently modify these statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different requirements for utilities and rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. 
For more information about the regulations to which we are subject and the risks to our operations related thereto, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Legal Matters and Regulations.
Backlog
The timing of delivery and installations of our products has a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of product and installation revenue. Many factors can cause a lag between the time a customer signs a purchase order and our recognition of product revenue. These factors include the number of Energy Servers installed per site, local permitting and utility requirements, environmental, health and safety requirements, weather, and customer facility construction schedules. Many of these factors are unpredictable and their resolution is often outside of our or our customers’ control. Customers may also ask us to delay an installation for reasons unrelated to the foregoing, including delays in their obtaining financing. Further, due to unexpected delays, deployments may require unanticipated expenses to expedite delivery of materials or labor to ensure the installation meets the timing objectives. These unexpected delays and expenses can be exacerbated in periods in which we deliver and install a larger number of smaller projects. In addition, if even relatively short delays occur, there may be a significant shortfall between the revenue we expect to generate in a particular period and the revenue that we are able to recognize. For our installations, revenue and cost of revenue can fluctuate significantly on a periodic basis depending on the timing of acceptance and the type of financing used by the customer.
See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Purchase and Lease Options – Delivery and Installation, for additional information on backlog.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,711 employees and contractors. We had approximately 1,316 full-time employees worldwide, of which 1,047 were located in the United States, 250 were located in India and 19 were located in other countries. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe our relations with our employees to be good.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off.
Our mission is to make clean, reliable energy affordable, globally, and we are also committed to creating a world-class workforce. We are committed to full-spectrum diversity inclusive of gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, age, ability, veteran status, religion, culture, background, and experiences. We strive to promote a culture of inclusion and diversity at all levels throughout Bloom.
In addition, we maintain an affirmative action program in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, executive orders, and government directives. We are committed to being a military-friendly employer, and we were recognized in 2018 with the Pro Patria Award by the Employer Support of the Guarded and Reserve (“ESGR”). This award recognizes employers who have demonstrated the greatest support to Guard and Reserve employees through their leadership and practices, and is the highest-level award that may be bestowed by an ESGR State Committee.
During the prior year, we successfully recruited and assimilated four additional key executives to the leadership team. This included a new Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Executive Vice President of Policy and Government Affairs, and Executive Vice President of International Business Development. 
With the onset of COVID-19, safety of our essential workers was our top priority followed by significantly increasing efforts to maintain and increase employee engagement. Our employee communication cadence increased exponentially including customized events and messaging designed to touch a diverse population.
We will continue to monitor and adjust as appropriate our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a technology company that supplies resilient, reliable and clean energy, we have been able to conduct the majority of operations as an “essential business” in California and Delaware, where we manufacture and perform many of our R&D activities, as well as in other states and countries where we are installing or maintaining our Energy Servers, notwithstanding government “shelter in place” orders. For the safety of our employees and others, many of our employees are still working from home unless they 
are directly supporting essential manufacturing production operations, installation work, service and maintenance activities and R&D. We have established protocols to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our facilities, including enhanced cleaning, and temperature screenings upon entry, as well as monthly testing at our manufacturing sites. In addition, all individuals entering our facilities are required to wear company-approved face coverings and are directed not to enter if they have COVID-19-like symptoms. Our policy is to follow CDC and local guidelines when notified of possible exposures. For more information regarding the risks posed to our company by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Products and Manufacturing – Our business has been and will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
