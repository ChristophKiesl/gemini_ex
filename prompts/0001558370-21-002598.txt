ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel medicines for patients affected by central nervous system, or CNS, disorders.
Our lead product, OLINVYK™ (oliceridine) injection, or OLINVYK, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in August 2020. We initiated commercial launch of OLINVYK in the first quarter of 2021. OLINVYK is an opioid agonist for use in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate. OLINVYK is the first new chemical entity, or NCE, in this intravenous, or IV-, drug class in decades and it offers a differentiated profile that addresses significant unmet needs in the acute pain management landscape. OLINVYK delivers IV opioid efficacy with a rapid 2-5 minute onset of action. In addition, OLINVYK requires no dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment, a large patient population with significant medical complications. In October 2020, we announced that OLINVYK received scheduling from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and oliceridine was classified as a Schedule II controlled substance.
Using our proprietary product platform, we also have identified and are developing the following product candidates: 

● | TRV027: We are developing TRV027, a novel angiotensin II type 1, or AT1, receptor selective agonist, for the treatment of acute lung injury contributing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, and abnormal blood clotting in patients with COVID-19. In a COVID-19 infection, the SARS-coronavirus-2 causes overactivation of the AT1 receptor resulting in downstream acute lung injury, which can lead to ARDS, and abnormal blood clotting, which can lead to pulmonary embolisms and strokes. TRV027 competitively binds to and rebalances AT1 receptor activation and also preferentially engages the beta-arrestin signaling pathway to promote reparative effects on lung tissue.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June 2020, we announced a collaboration with Imperial College London, or ICL, to study TRV027 in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of approximately 60 COVID-19 patients. ICL is sponsoring and funding this study, with additional support from the British Heart Foundation Centre for Research Excellence Award, and expects the primary completion date to be in the first half of 2021. TRV027 previously demonstrated efficacy, potency, and selectivity at the AT1 receptor in nonclinical studies related to acute heart failure, and it has a well-characterized pharmacokinetic profile.

● | TRV250: We are developing TRV250, a G-protein biased delta-opioid receptor, or DOR, agonist as a compound with a potential first-in-class novel mechanism for the treatment of acute migraine. TRV250 also may have utility in a range of other CNS indications. Because TRV250 selectively targets the DOR, we believe it will not have the addiction liability of conventional opioids or have other mu-opioid related adverse effects like respiratory depression and constipation. In June 2018, we announced the completion of our first-in-human Phase 1 study of TRV250. Data from this healthy volunteer study showed a favorable tolerability profile and pharmacokinetics supporting the advancement of TRV250 to proof-of-concept evaluation in patients. The proof-of-concept study protocol required subjects to be monitored in an in-patient setting for 24 hours, and due to the global COVID-19 pandemic we terminated the study in August 2020. In March 2021, we announced that we identified a novel oral dose formulation for TRV250. The process development work for the oral form has the potential to extend the patent for TRV250 by an additional five years to 2041. We have initiated IND-enabling activities with the oral dosage form to support future clinical development.

● | TRV734: We also have identified and have completed the initial Phase 1 studies for TRV734, an NCE targeting the same novel mechanism of action at the MOR as OLINVYK. TRV734 was designed to be

orally available, and its mechanism of action suggests it may offer valuable benefits for two distinct areas of important unmet medical need: acute and chronic pain, and maintenance-assisted therapy for patients with opioid use disorder, or OUD. We are collaborating with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, to further evaluate TRV734 for the management of OUD, and NIDA initiated a proof-of-concept study for this indication in December 2019. In March 2020, we announced that due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment was paused in this trial. We intend to continue to focus our efforts for TRV734 on securing a development and commercialization partner for this asset.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | TRV045: We are evaluating a set of novel S1P modulators that may offer a new, non-opioid approach to managing chronic pain. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we identified a new product candidate, TRV045, a novel S1P modulator that we believe may offer a new, non-opioid approach to managing chronic pain. In the second quarter of 2019, we initiated investigational new drug, or IND, enabling work, and we will continue to evaluate the progression of this asset, either by ourselves or with a partner. In March 2020, we announced we entered into a collaboration with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to evaluate the potential of TRV045 as a treatment for epilepsy. In May 2020, we announced we entered into a collaboration with the NIH to evaluate the potential of TRV045 as a treatment for pain. NIH is assessing TRV045 within its Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program, or ETSP, and in its Preclinical Screening Platform for Pain, or PSPP. We expect to file an IND application with the FDA for TRV045 in the first half of 2021.

Our Product and Pipeline

OLINVYK ™ (oliceridine) injection
OLINVYK is a G-protein biased MOR ligand that we are commercializing in hospitals or other controlled clinical settings for acute pain in adults that is severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate. It is an NCE with a novel mechanism of action.

Pain treatment options
Approximately 45 million hospital patients in the United States were treated with an IV opioid for acute pain, according to 2017 IQVIA data. Conventional IV opioid analgesics, such as morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone, have been core components of pain management protocols in the immediate postoperative period. The effectiveness of conventional opioids agonists is limited by severe dose dependent side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, which can be exacerbated by accumulation of active metabolites and by reduced renal clearance in patients with impaired kidney function. These shortcomings of conventional IV opioids create substantial challenges for healthcare providers in certain clinical practice situations.
Injectable non-opioid analgesics are often used together with IV opioids in multimodal protocols for post-surgical pain management. However, these drugs, such as IV non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, IV acetaminophen, or local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, have their own potential for cardiovascular, hepatic and gastrointestinal side effects. In addition, none of these non-opioid analgesics offers sufficient efficacy to manage severe acute pain as a monotherapy in many patients.
We believe that OLINVYK addresses a significant unmet need for a highly effective IV opioid analgesic agent with a differentiated safety, tolerability, and PK/PD profile. OLINVYK delivers IV opioid efficacy with a rapid 2-5 minute onset of action and requires no dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment, a large patient population with significant medical complications. Data from an exploratory analysis was recently published that highlights the low incidence of opioid-induced respiratory depression in patients treated with OLINYK, regardless of age or body mass index.
OLINVYK was approved by the FDA in August 2020 for both bolus and patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA, delivery and we initiated commercial launch of OLINVYK in the first quarter of 2021. The DEA has classified oliceridine as a Schedule II controlled substance. Like other opioids, the label for OLINVYK contains a “boxed” warning and important safety information. Please consult www.olinvyk.com to view the prescribing information together with important safety information and boxed warning.
OLINVYK clinical data
APOLLO 1 and APOLLO 2 Phase 3 Studies
We conducted two pivotal efficacy trials evaluating OLINVYK in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain: the APOLLO 1 study, which evaluated pain for 48 hours following bunionectomy, and the APOLLO 2 study, which evaluated pain for 24 hours following abdominoplasty. In both studies, all dose regimens achieved the primary endpoint of statistically greater analgesic efficacy than placebo, as measured by responder rate. On the secondary endpoint of summary of pain intensity difference (SPID) assessed by numerical rating scale, in the APOLLO 1 study, all dose regimens achieved statistically greater pain relief compared to placebo, while in the APOLLO 2 study, the 0.35mg and 0.5mg dose regimens achieved statistically greater pain relief compared to placebo.
The APOLLO 1 and APOLLO 2 studies were both Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled studies of OLINVYK. During the study period, a loading dose of placebo, morphine (4 mg), or OLINVYK (1.5 mg) was administered first, and then patients used a PCA button to dose themselves as often as every 6 minutes with the same study drug: placebo, 1 mg morphine, or 0.1 mg, 0.35 mg, or 0.5 mg OLINVYK. If PCA dosing was inadequate to control pain, patients could request supplemental study medication (2 mg morphine or 0.75 mg OLINVYK, no more than once an hour). If the study medication regimen did not adequately manage pain, patients could opt for an NSAID rescue analgesic. Loading, demand, and supplemental doses were volume-matched for all treatment regimens.
All endpoints were the same in both studies, except that dosing and pain assessment were for 48 hours in APOLLO 1 and 24 hours in APOLLO 2. The primary efficacy outcome was measured using a categorical responder analysis, which defined a responder as a patient who experienced at least a 30% reduction in their sum of pain intensity difference at the end of the treatment period without either early discontinuation (for lack of efficacy or 

7



safety/tolerability) or use of rescue medication. The summary of pain intensity difference (SPID), which the FDA used as the basis of approval, was a secondary endpoint in both studies and was assessed by numerical rating scale through the randomized treatment period (48 hours in APOLLO 1 and 24 hours in APOLLO 2) and compared to placebo. Non-inferior efficacy compared to morphine and superior efficacy compared to morphine were key secondary endpoints. Respiratory safety events were defined as clinically relevant worsening of respiratory status, including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, or sedation. The product of the frequency and conditional duration of these events was reported as respiratory safety burden, a key secondary endpoint. Additional measures of respiratory safety included incidence of oxygen saturation less than 90% and incidence of supplemental oxygen use. Measures of gastrointestinal tolerability included use of rescue antiemetics, vomiting, and spontaneously reported nausea.
APOLLO 1 (bunionectomy)

● | All three OLINVYK regimens (0.1 mg, 0.35 mg, and 0.5 mg on-demand doses) achieved the primary endpoint with statistically superior responder rates compared to placebo at 48 hours (p<0.0001, adjusted for multiplicity).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following the 1.5 mg initial loading dose, all OLINVYK regimens demonstrated rapid onset with statistically significant efficacy within 5 minutes (p<0.05).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APOLLO 2 (abdominoplasty)

● | All three OLINVYK dose regimens achieved the primary endpoint with statistically superior responder rates compared to placebo at 24 hours (adjusted p<0.05 for the 0.1 mg regimen; adjusted p<0.001 for the 0.35 mg and 0.5 mg regimens).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following the 1.5 mg initial loading dose, all OLINVYK regimens demonstrated rapid onset with statistically significant efficacy within 5 to 15 minutes (p<0.05).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In both studies, OLINVYK was generally well-tolerated. The most common drug related adverse events (incidence ≥10%) were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, constipation, pruritus and hypoxia.
ATHENA Phase 3 Open Label Safety Study
We conducted a Phase 3, open label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of OLINVYK in patients with moderate-to-severe pain caused by surgery or medical conditions. The trial was designed to model real-world use, including the use of multi-modal analgesia. Patients were treated with OLINVYK on an as-needed basis via IV bolus, patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA, or both, as determined by the investigator. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of OLINVYK. Pain intensity was measured as a secondary endpoint.
In the ATHENA study, 768 patients were treated with OLINVYK. The most common procedures were orthopedic, gynecologic, colorectal, and general surgeries. Patients at elevated risk of opioid-related adverse events were well represented; more than 30% of patients were 65 years or older, and approximately 50% of patients were obese, with body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2. Only 2% of patients discontinued for adverse events, and 4% of patients discontinued for lack of efficacy. The most common adverse events were nausea, constipation, and vomiting. Adverse event rates associated with OLINVYK administered by PCA and as-needed bolus dosing were similar, supporting the potential use of OLINVYK in both administration paradigms.
OLINVYK Commercialization
We initiated commercial launch of OLINVYK in the first quarter of 2021 with a customer-facing team of approximately 40 individuals across a range of roles including Key Account Managers, Institutional Account Managers and other professionals. Our commercial focus is on hospitals as well as outpatient surgical departments and ambulatory 

8



surgical centers and we will target a range of specialties including surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and other healthcare providers with acute post-surgical or medical pain management responsibility.
Approximately 45 million hospital patients in the United States were treated with an IV opioid for acute pain, with the majority of doses in the inpatient setting. We estimate that 9 million of these patients are at increased risk of opioid-related adverse events such as respiratory depression or post-operative nausea and vomiting. Many of these patients are elderly and have comorbid conditions, driving surgical complexity and a potential for an increased length of stay. This growing patient population results in a significant cost burden to the hospital system, and we have completed health economic analyses framing significant cost savings due to OLINVYK relative to conventional IV opioids in these patients. We intend to publish these data in the peer-reviewed medical literature.
We believe the greatest opportunity for OLINVYK will be in the inpatient setting where patients are treated with multiple doses for an average of one to two days. Due to its quick onset and duration of analgesia, OLINVYK is also well suited for use in the growing hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgical center settings. Because many surgeons and anesthesiologists manage both inpatient and outpatient cases, we believe that early physician experiences with OLINVYK in outpatient surgery may support subsequent expansion of use to the inpatient setting.
Approximately 1,200 US hospitals are responsible for 70% of the annual volume of conventional IV opioid drugs prescribed, according to 2017 data from Symphony Health Solutions. We have identified a subset of approximately 550 high volume hospitals that have rapidly adopted new branded analgesic agents in the past as the initial account targets.
We are committed to the ethical promotion of OLINVYK. The Company’s goal is not to increase opioid usage; rather, the Company and its representative are asking healthcare professionals to consider OLINVYK as a differentiated alternative versus conventional IV opioids when an IV opioid is necessary to manage the patient’s acute pain.
Manufacturing
We have completed process development of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in OLINVYK and have manufactured multiple commercial-scale batches under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. We also have completed drug product process development and have manufactured multiple commercial-scale batches of drug product under cGMP conditions.
For OLINVYK, we have established commercial supply agreements for the manufacture of the API and finished (compounded, filled and packaged) drug product. Sterling Pharma Solutions (formerly Alcami Corporation), or Sterling, is contracted to supply 100% of our commercial API from its Germantown, WI manufacturing facility. We have existing commercial supply agreements with two separate companies for the supply of drug product. Alcami Corporation, or Alcami, is contracted to supply commercial drug product from its facilities in Charleston, SC and Wilmington, NC and was included as part of our NDA submission. Pfizer CentreOne (formerly Hospira) is also contracted to supply commercial drug product in the future from its facility in Rocky Mount, NC, but was not included in our NDA submission. 
In October 2020, we announced that the DEA has classified OLINVYK as a Schedule II controlled substance. All third-party facilities throughout the supply chain have the appropriate licenses from the DEA for handling Schedule II controlled substances according to each of their respective contractual roles (manufacturing, testing, distribution, etc.).
Competition
OLINVYK is approved for use in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are not adequate. We expect OLINVYK to compete with generic IV opioid analgesics, such as morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl. The analgesic effectiveness of these agents is limited by well-known adverse side effects, such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and post-operative ileus, which can be exacerbated by the way these molecules are metabolized or cleared. OLINVYK will also compete against, or be used in combination with, OFIRMEV® (IV acetaminophen), marketed by Mallinckrodt plc; 

9



EXPAREL® (liposomal bupivacaine), marketed by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; CALDOLOR® (IV ibuprofen), marketed by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals; DSUVIA™ (sublingual sufentanil) marketed by AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and ANJESO™ (IV meloxicam), marketed by Baudax Bio, Inc.; XARACOLL™ (bupivacaine HCL) implant, marketed by Innocoll Holdings plc; and POSIMIR® (bupivacaine solution) marketed by DURECT Corporation. Together with generic versions of IV NSAIDs such as ketorolac and acetaminophen, and generic versions of local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, these non-opioid analgesics are currently used in combination with opioids in the multimodal management of moderate-to-severe acute pain.
We also are aware of a number of products in mid- and late-stage clinical development that are aimed at improving the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain and may compete with OLINVYK. AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing ZALVISO™, a non-invasive PCA device containing sublingual sufentanil, which has received approval in the European Union. Heron Therapeutics Inc. has a proprietary long acting reformulation of bupivacaine in development. Cara Therapeutics Inc. is developing IV and oral dose forms of a peripherally restricted Κ opioid receptor agonist, which has been administered in combination with mu opioids in clinical trials. Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. is developing an IV version of generic opioid tramadol for moderate-to-severe acute pain.

Intellectual property
We wholly own the OLINVYK patent portfolio, including four issued U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,835,488, 9,309,234, 9,642,842, and 9,849,119), which claim, among other things, OLINVYK, compositions comprising OLINVYK, and methods of using OLINVYK. The issued patents are expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions, and any U.S. patent to issue in the future is also expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We also have issued patents in Australia, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, India, South Korea, and New Zealand, which claim among other things, OLINVYK, compositions comprising OLINVYK and methods of making or using OLINVYK. The foreign portfolio also includes an application that has been allowed by the European Patent Office, which claim among other things, OLINVYK, compositions comprising OLINVYK and methods of using OLINVYK. We have patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, Japan, Israel, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, and India. The issued patents and patents that could issue in the future from these allowed or pending applications outside the United States are expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. Following the FDA approval of OLINVYK, the FDA has added three issued U.S. patents to the Orange Book of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,835,488, 9,309,234, 9,642,842). In addition, the Company has filed Patent Term Extension applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office that could extend the life of one of the patents until 2034. Finally, the FDA has designated OLINVYK as a new chemical entity, or NCE, in the Orange Book and it will therefore receive the exclusivity and protections afforded to NCE’s.
TRV027
TRV027 is a novel beta-arrestin biased ligand that targets the AT1 receptor, inhibiting angiotensin II mediated G protein signaling and activating beta-arrestin signaling. We are developing TRV027 for the treatment of acute lung injury contributing to ARDS and abnormal blood clotting in patients with COVID-19. In a COVID-19 infection, the SARS-coronavirus-2 binds to and removes the ACE2 protein in the lungs and other tissues in the body, causing elevated levels of angiotensin II. This drives overactivation of the AT1 receptor resulting in downstream acute lung injury, which can lead to ARDS, and abnormal blood clotting, which can further lead to pulmonary embolisms and strokes. We believe that TRV027 has the potential to counteract the disproportionate levels of angiotensin II, by competitively binding to and rebalancing AT1 receptor activation. Additionally, we believe its unique mechanism of action preferentially engages the beta-arrestin signaling pathway to promote reparative effects on lung tissue.
Clinical Development
In June 2020, we announced a collaboration with ICL to study TRV027 in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in approximately 60 COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint of this proof-of-concept study is a coagulation cascade biomarker, which serves as a surrogate for measuring the effect of TRV027 on adverse health outcomes associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 infections. ICL is sponsoring and funding this study, with additional 

10



support from the British Heart Foundation Centre for Research Excellence Award and expects the primary completion date to be in the first half of 2021.
Intellectual property
We wholly own the TRV027 patent portfolio, including four issued U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,486,885; 8,796,204; 8,809,260; and 8,993,511) that claim, among other things, TRV027, compositions comprising TRV027, and methods of using TRV027. We also have issued patents in Europe, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, China, and Hong Kong. The issued U.S. patents covering the composition of matter and methods of using TRV027 are expected to expire no earlier than 2031 (U.S. Patent No. 8,486,885) and 2029 (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,796,204; 8,809,260; and 8,993,511), subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The issued European Patent is expected to provide coverage for TRV027 throughout most of European Union until at least 2029, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The portfolio also includes issued U.S. Patent No. 9,518,086 that claims, among other things, crystalline forms of TRV027 and methods of using crystalline forms of TRV027 and the issued U.S. Patent No. 9,611,293 that claims, among other things, methods of synthesizing TRV027. The issued U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,518,086 and U.S. 9,611,293) covering crystalline forms of TRV027 and methods of synthesizing TRV027, which are expected to expire no earlier than 2035, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. Additionally, our TRV027 patent portfolio includes two pending provisional applications that are, among other things, directed to methods of treating ARDS, such as ARDS caused by COVID-19, and/or preventing and treating thrombosis using TRV027 and compounds related thereto.
TRV250
TRV250 is a G-protein biased ligand targeting the DOR agonist as a compound with potential first-in-class, novel mechanism for the treatment of acute migraine. TRV250 also may have utility in a range of other CNS indications. We have completed a first-in-human Phase 1 trial of TRV250, which showed a favorable tolerability profile and pharmacokinetics. In November 2019, we initiated a proof-of-concept evaluation in patients, which required subjects to be monitored in an in-patient setting for 24 hours. Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we terminated the study in August 2020. In March 2021, we announced that we identified a novel oral dose formulation for TRV250. The process development work for the oral form has the potential to extend the patent for TRV250 by an additional five years to 2041. We have initiated IND-enabling activities with the oral dosage form to support future clinical development.
Clinical development
We believe our preclinical data support targeting the DOR for the treatment of CNS disorders. Prior approaches to modulate this receptor have been limited by a significant risk of seizure associated with this target. Preclinical studies in beta-arrestin knockout mice suggest that beta-arrestin plays a role in seizures. TRV250 is a potent delta receptor ligand that selectively activates G-protein coupling without engaging beta arrestin, leading to strong efficacy in animal models of migraine and other CNS disorders with reduced seizure liability. In the future, we may decide to seek a collaborator for TRV250 with CNS development and commercialization expertise outside the United States.
In June 2018, we announced the completion of our first-in-human Phase 1 study of TRV250. Data from this healthy volunteer study showed a favorable tolerability profile and pharmacokinetics. The Phase 1 study was a two part, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous and oral TRV250 in healthy adults. Part A assessed single subcutaneous doses in 38 subjects. Four cohorts of nine or ten subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of up to 30mg TRV250 or placebo. Part B consisted of a single cohort of nine subjects administered either TRV250 as a single 6 mg oral dose (either as a capsule in the fed state or a capsule in the fasted state, n=7) or placebo (as a capsule in the fed or fasted state, n=2).
Key findings of the study included:

● | Dose-related increases in plasma concentrations following subcutaneous administration of doses up to 30 mg, with rapid absorption in the first hour and duration of exposure appropriate for treating acute migraine;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | Subcutaneous doses at and above 9 mg achieved plasma concentrations that were active in preclinical models of migraine;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Oral bioavailability similar to existing migraine medications, supporting continued development of TRV250 in oral and/or subcutaneous formulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No observed drug-associated electroencephalography changes, consistent with preclinical studies in which TRV250 avoided the seizure liability associated with previous CNS-active delta receptor agonists; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No clinically significant changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or ECG parameters, and no severe or serious adverse events reported.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the profile of TRV250, we believe it has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment option for treatment of migraine. According to Decision Resources, a healthcare consulting company, the acute migraine treatment market encompassed approximately 12 million drug-treated patients in 2017 in the United States, representing approximately $1.5 billion of sales. We estimate that approximately 20% to 30% of these patients either do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, the market-leading triptan drug class, and an additional 30% would benefit from improved efficacy compared to these drugs.
Competition
Triptans, a generic family of 5-HT1B agonists, are the current standard treatment for acute treatment of migraine in the United States, and account for 70% of sales for this indication. Other less commonly prescribed acute treatments include ergot alkaloids, and analgesics such as opioids and NSAIDs. Various branded reformulations of triptan molecules have been launched, and we are aware of others in development. In May 2016, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. launched a dry powder nasal delivery formulation of sumatriptan, called ONZETRA™ Xsail™. RedHill Biopharma, Ltd. and IntelGenx Corp. resubmitted the 505(b)(2) NDA for RIZAPORT®, an oral thin film rizatriptan formulation, to the FDA in November 2018. Eli Lilly acquired Lasmiditan (REYVOW®), a selective 5-HT1F agonist, from Colucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and received FDA approval in October 2019. BioHaven launched Rimegepant (NURTEC) in 2020 and they have a second CGRP receptor antagonist candidate (vazegepant) in early development for acute treatment of migraine. In 2019, Allergan launched Ubrelvy™ (ubrogepant) an oral, small molecule anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, for treatment of acute migraine.
Patients suffering from frequent or chronic migraine headaches may also use preventative agents to decrease the frequency and severity of migraines. Botox® is the historical gold standard migraine prophylactic, but certain anticonvulsants, such as topiramate, and beta-blockers, such as propranolol, have also been used. However, a new class of anti-CGRP antibody products are being marketed for preventative treatment of migraine: In 2018, Amgen and Novartis launched Aimovig® (erenumab), Eli Lilly and Company launched Emgality® (galcanezumab), and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited launched Ajovy® (fremanezumab). In 2020, Alder BioPharmaceuticals Inc. launched VyeptiTM (eptinezumab-jjmr) and AbbVie announced positive phase 3 data for atogepant, an oral small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist. Allergan also has late stage migraine prevention trials underway for atogepant, an oral small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist. Biohaven is conducting clinical trials of zavegepant (also a CGRP receptor antagonist) for the prevention of migraine.
Intellectual property
We wholly own the TRV250 patent portfolio, including one issued patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,246,436) in the United States directed to compounds that modulate the delta receptor, claiming, among other things, TRV250, compositions comprising TRV250, and methods of using TRV250. The patent is expected to expire no earlier than 2036, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We also have patent applications pending in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. Any patents that may issue from these applications are expected to expire no earlier than 2036, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We also have one pending provisional patent application that is, among other things, directed to crystalline forms of TRV250, compositions comprising crystalline forms of TRV250, and methods of using crystalline forms of TRV250.

that may issue based on this provisional application would be expected to expire no earlier than 2041, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.
TRV734
TRV734 is a small molecule G-protein biased ligand of the MOR that we discovered and have developed through Phase 1 as a first-line, orally administered compound for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute and chronic pain. Like OLINVYK, TRV734 utilizes a well-established mechanism of pain relief by targeting the MOR. Also like OLINVYK, it does so with enhanced selectivity for the G-protein signaling pathway, which in preclinical studies was linked to analgesia, as opposed to the beta-arrestin signaling pathway, which in preclinical studies was associated with side effects. Subject to successful preclinical and clinical development and regulatory approval, we believe TRV734 may have an improved efficacy and side effect profile as compared to current commonly prescribed oral analgesics, such as oxycodone. In addition, TRV734’s mechanism of action suggests it may offer valuable benefits for another unmet medical need: the management of opioid dependence associated with OUD. We intend to continue to focus our efforts for TRV734 on securing a development and commercialization partner for this asset.
Clinical development
We have completed three Phase 1 trials of TRV734 in healthy volunteers, including a single ascending dose study, a multiple ascending dose study, and a pharmacokinetic study. In these studies, a total of 127 healthy volunteers were exposed to TRV734 at doses between 2 mg and 250 mg. We incorporated measures to assess the potential for analgesic efficacy and tolerability advantages in these studies. Based on these data and data for OLINVYK, we believe that TRV734 may offer an improved efficacy profile as compared to current opioid therapies or equivalent efficacy with an improved gastrointestinal tolerability and respiratory safety profile.
In collaboration with NIDA, we intend to pursue a clinical study to determine whether TRV734 decreases symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients with OUD. We expect to initiate a randomized, double-blind, four-period, placebo- and positive-controlled study that will enroll approximately 50 opioid-dependent patients undergoing stable methadone maintenance therapy. The primary objective of the study is to assess the ability of TRV734 to reduce acute opioid craving symptoms, as measured by the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale. The study will also evaluate whether TRV734 suppresses withdrawal signs using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale. Secondary outcomes will include assessments of safety and measures of neurocognitive changes. In March 2020, we announced that due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment has been paused in this trial.
NIDA has previously generated preclinical data in a rodent model of maintenance treatment showing that chronic administration of TRV734 reduced oxycodone-seeking in rats. TRV734 may provide an alternative to existing therapies such as methadone and buprenorphine. Successful therapy with methadone is limited by side effects that include sedation and constipation, while use of buprenorphine is limited by lower maximal efficacy and challenges with initial induction of therapy. It is hypothesized that a MOR-biased agonist may provide high efficacy for preventing symptoms of opioid withdrawal while offering a more benign side-effect profile.
Intellectual property
We wholly own the TRV734 patent portfolio, including two issued U.S. patents (U.S. Patent No, 9,044,469 and 10,588,898) claiming TRV734, other compounds and/or methods of making or using the same. This patent is expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We also have issued patents in Australia, China, Europe, Eurasia, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, India, South Korea, and New Zealand claiming TRV734, other compounds and/or methods of making or using the same. We also have patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, Israel, India, and Hong Kong. The issued patents and patents that could issue in the future from these allowed or pending applications outside the United States are expected to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions.

TRV045 (S1P Modulators)
We are evaluating a set of novel S1P modulators that may offer a new, non-opioid approach to managing chronic pain. The compounds we are evaluating are all NCEs, are expected to be non-addictive, and use a new mechanism of action that in preclinical models avoids the lymphocyte trafficking effects and immune suppression associated with approved and investigational S1P receptor targeted drugs. These molecules have demonstrated activity in preclinical models of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain, and inflammatory pain. 
Our first product candidate under this program is TRV045, a novel S1P modulator. In the second quarter of 2019, we initiated IND-enabling work for this product candidate, and we intend to continue to progress this asset to an IND, either independently or with a partner. We expect to file an IND application with the FDA for TRV045 in the first half of 2021.
We have entered into collaborations with the NIH to evaluate the potential of TRV045 as a treatment for chronic pain and epilepsy. NIH is assessing TRV045 within its Preclinical Screening Platform for Pain and its Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program.
Intellectual Property
We wholly own the S1P patent portfolio, including one provisional application, two Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications, and applications filed in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. The applications are directed to, amongst other things, compounds that modulate the S1P receptor and methods of using these compounds, including for methods of treating pain, epilepsy, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and trauma-and stressor-related disorders. Patents that could issue in the future from the national phase applications would be expected to expire no earlier than 2038, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We are aware of a certain U.S. patent owned by a third party with claims that are broadly directed to a method of treating chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain with an S1P receptor agonist or an S1P receptor antagonist. Although we do not believe that this is a valid patent, this patent could be construed to cover our S1P compounds.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of modulating G-protein coupled receptors with biased ligands.
One or more third parties may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that is important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. If we were not able to obtain a license or were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment for our product candidates. We anticipate seeking patent protection in the United States and 

14



internationally for compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the patent’s scope can be modified after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Because many patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain patent protection for the inventions disclosed and/or claimed in our pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, inter partes review, post grant review or a derivation proceeding, that challenge our entitlement to an invention or the patentability of one or more claims in our patent applications or issued patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a PCT application or a non-provisional patent application, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted and extended due to the failure of the United States Patent and Trademark Office following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for issuing a patent.
In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug also may be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during clinical development and the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under clinical development and regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our additional pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products much in the same manner as we did for OLINVYK. Although, we intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.

Manufacturing
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture. See “—OLINVYK (oliceridine) injection—Manufacturing.”
The use of contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and reliance on collaboration partners is cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. We believe available CMOs are capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands.
Commercialization
We are launching the customer-facing elements of our commercial team in the first quarter of 2021. We have partnered with Syneos Health in the sourcing, training and deployment of a range of customer-facing roles including Key Account Managers, sales representatives and other professionals. Syneos Health is a well-known contract sales organization with broad experience in providing the services and support for which we have engaged them. We believe this engagement will allow us to effectively and efficiently address the community of physicians who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product is indicated. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other commercial arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval. In parallel with building our commercial organization, we plan to develop educational initiatives with respect to approved products and relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. OLINVYK and any further product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Products in development by other companies may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for OLINVYK and any of our additional product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
Some of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong 

16



market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Regulation 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, covering each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of an NDA to the FDA;
--+---------------------------------


● | completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine GCP compliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of an NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------

17




● | in certain cases, DEA review and scheduling activities prior to launch.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Manufacture of drug substance, drug product and the labeling and distribution of clinical supplies must all comply with cGMP standards. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the data submitted in the IND or the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB covering each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of a marketing application.

18



In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. We expect that any oral mu-opioid agonist products may be subject to a REMS, since currently marketed oral opioid products are subject to this requirement. OLINVYK is an IV opioid and is not subject to a REMS.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA typically refers a question regarding a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection, or PAI. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. The FDA reviews NDA resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial distribution and marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, 

19



require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months.
Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval, which is described in Subpart H of 21 Code of Federal Regulations, or 21 CFR Part 314, provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a clinical measurement or other biomarker used as an indirect or substitute measurement to predict a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
A Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and FDA review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions or where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to an IND.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including clinical trials in pediatric patients or other Phase 4 trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. 

20



Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-marketing studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies generally are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
DEA Regulation
OLINVYK has been classified as a Schedule II controlled substance under the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA. The CSA establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Because it is a Schedule II controlled substance, the manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of OLINVYK is subject to a high degree of regulation.

21



Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, exports, or conducts research with any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, or impact the ability to fill orders of approved products such as OLINVYK.
To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation with respect to the distribution of these products.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, as well as transparency and data privacy and security laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and others on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
The reach of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined 

22



to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. PPACA also created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs of payments and other transfers of value to, as well as ownership interests held by, physicians and teaching hospitals.
The federal criminal and civil false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, also known as Open Payments program, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposed specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on "covered entities," including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing 

23



requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals, and data privacy requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these antibribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a payor-by-payor basis. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. In addition, for hospital products, a private health insurer or Medicare will typically reimburse a fixed fee for certain procedures, including in-patient surgeries. Pharmaceutical products such as OLINVYK that may be used in connection with the surgery generally will not be separately reimbursed and, therefore, a hospital would have to assess the cost of OLINVYK relative to its benefits. Current or future efforts to limit the level of reimbursement for in-patient hospital 

24



procedures could cause a hospital to decide not to use OLINVYK. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenue from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
PPACA became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the PPACA established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increased the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued judicial, executive branch, and legislative activity around, attempts to repeal or repeal and replace the PPACA. For example, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Additionally, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate,” the tax-based shared responsibility payment on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health 

25



coverage for all or part of a year, was repealed by Congress as part of legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. On November 10, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the case. A ruling is expected in 2021. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our product candidates, once approved, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates once they are approved.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, was signed into law. Among other things, this law created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 became law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, a “Blueprint” was released to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. While some of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, the federal and state governments have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. We cannot anticipate what impact these or other future healthcare reform initiatives will have on coverage and reimbursement of our products or our business more generally, including the impact of the new presidential administration.
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited 

26



by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro and/or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage, dosage form, or indication.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a patent of a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
Hatch-Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. OLINVYK has been designated as a new chemical entity in the FDA’s Orange Book. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving 

27



ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any of our products is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate.
Foreign Regulation
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Investing in, developing, and maintaining human capital is critical to our success. As of December 31, 2020, we had 25 employees, all of whom are located in the United States. We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development, and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. Accordingly, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so 

28



they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the community in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations, including working from home where appropriate.
Corporate Compliance Program
Our business is subject to extensive regulations. Management has designed and implemented a comprehensive corporate compliance program as part of our commitment to comply fully with applicable criminal, civil and administrative laws, rules and regulations and to maintain the high standards of conduct we expect from all of our employees. We continuously review this compliance program and work to enhance it as and when appropriate. The primary purposes of the compliance program include, among other things:

● | Assessing and identifying risks affecting our Company and its products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | training and educating employees and certain outside professionals who provide services to our Company to promote awareness of legal and regulatory requirements, a culture of compliance, and the necessity of complying with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing and implementing compliance policies and procedures and creating controls to support compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and requirements and our policies and procedures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | auditing and monitoring the activities of our operations and business support functions to identify and mitigate risks and potential instances of noncompliance in a timely manner; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ensuring that we promptly take steps to resolve any instances of noncompliance and address areas of weakness or potential noncompliance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have a Code of Conduct that guides and binds each of our employees, officers and directors.  We use an anonymous compliance hotline for employees and outside parties to report potential instances of noncompliance. Our Chief Legal and Compliance Officer administers the compliance program and chairs the Company’s Compliance Committee. The Chief Legal and Compliance Officer reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and meets regularly with the Chair of the Audit Committee.
