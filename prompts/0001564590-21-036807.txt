ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 As used in this document, the terms “Culp,” the “company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Culp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless the context indicates another meaning). The term “common stock” means the common stock of Culp, Inc., par value $.05 per share. The terms “Read Window Products” and “Read” refer to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Read Window Products, LLC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the company sold its majority ownership interest in eLuxury, LLC (“eLuxury”), resulting in the elimination of the company’s home accessory segment at the time of such sale. Accordingly, the results of operations for this segment are excluded from the company’s continuing operations for the fiscal 2020 year and all prior periods of comparison, and the financial results are presented as a discontinued operation in the company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Overview
 Culp manufactures, sources, and markets mattress fabrics and sewn covers used for covering mattresses and foundations and other bedding products; and upholstery fabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily used in the production of upholstered furniture. The company competes in a fashion-driven business, and we strive to differentiate ourselves by placing a sustained focus on product innovation and creativity. In addition, we place great emphasis on providing excellent and dependable service to our customers. Our focused efforts to protect our financial strength have allowed us to maintain our position as a financially stable and trusted supplier of innovative fabrics to bedding and furniture manufacturers.
 We believe Culp is the largest producer of mattress fabrics in North America and one of the largest marketers of upholstery fabrics for furniture in North America, measured by total sales. Our continuing operations are classified into two operating segments — mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics. The mattress fabrics business markets primarily knitted and woven fabrics, as well as sewn covers made from those fabrics, which are used in the production of bedding products, including mattresses, foundations, and mattress sets. The upholstery fabrics business markets a variety of fabric products that are used principally in the production of residential and commercial upholstered furniture, including sofas, recliners, chairs, loveseats, sectionals, sofa-beds, and office seating, as well as window treatment products and installation services for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries. 
 Culp markets a variety of fabrics and other products in different categories to a global customer base, including fabrics produced at our manufacturing facilities and fabrics produced by other suppliers. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had active production facilities located in North Carolina; Tennessee; Quebec, Canada; Shanghai, China; and, following our recent acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest in our existing unconsolidated joint venture, a wholly-owned mattress cover operation located in Ouanaminthe, Haiti. We also source fabrics and cut and sewn kits from other manufacturers, located primarily in China, Vietnam, and Turkey, with substantially all of these products made specifically for Culp and created by Culp designers. We also operate distribution centers in North Carolina, Canada, China, and Haiti to facilitate distribution of our fabric products, with additional distribution capabilities through strategic relationships in Vietnam.
 Over the past decade, the portion of total company sales represented by fabrics produced outside of the U.S. and Canada has increased, while sales of goods produced in the U.S. have decreased. This trend is related primarily to the upholstery fabrics segment, where, following the closure of our manufacturing facility in Anderson, South Carolina, during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, substantially all of our sales now consist of fabrics produced in Asia. The mattress fabrics business remains primarily based in North America. 
 Total net sales in fiscal 2021 were $299.7 million. The mattress fabrics segment had net sales of $157.7 million (53% of total net sales), and the upholstery fabrics segment had net sales of $142.0 million (47% of total net sales). 
 Sales increased significantly in our mattress fabrics business and our residential upholstery fabrics business during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year, which was materially affected by disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. This growth was driven primarily by the increased consumer focus on the at-home experience and overall comfort due to the pandemic, combined with our ability to meet this surge in demand and respond quickly to meet the needs of new and existing customers through our flexible, global platform. 
 Overall, Culp faced a difficult business environment during fiscal 2021, particularly with the ongoing disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter, as well as additional headwinds throughout the year relating to customer capacity limitations, primarily due to supply chain disruption for non-fabric components and labor shortages, as well as ongoing foreign currency fluctuations in China. Despite these challenges, both the mattress fabrics segment and upholstery fabrics segment have continued to execute our product-driven strategy and focus on innovation and design creativity. Our company’s diversified manufacturing and sourcing capabilities, stable supply chain, and focus on innovation have helped us successfully weather the initial pandemic-related downturn in our business, as well as the ongoing headwinds throughout fiscal 2021, to finish the year as a stronger company both operationally and financially. We have also continued building upon strategic initiatives and structural changes that were implemented over the last 
 2


several years to consolidate and streamline operations, while adding capacity where necessary, including our investment in additional knit machines for our mattress fabrics business, our fourth-quarter acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest in our Haiti cut and sew operation, and our recently-commenced expansion of our Haiti operations to add a new facility dedicated to production of cut and sewn upholstery kits. 
 Additional information about trends and developments in each of our business segments is provided in the “Segments” discussion below, as well as in our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in Part II, Section 7 of this report.
 
COVID-19 Impact and Business Response
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. This declaration, along with the continued spread of the disease to other countries, including the United States and other countries in which we operate, prompted federal, state, and local governments throughout the world to take a variety of actions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders, temporary quarantines, restrictions on public gatherings, social distancing measures, mandated closures of non-essential businesses, occupancy limits, and other safety measures. Due to government-mandated closure requirements near the end of March 2020, we shut down our facilities in Canada and Haiti for several weeks, and most of our customers, as well as retail stores in the United States and around the globe, were similarly shut down or operating at significantly reduced capacity.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took steps to help safeguard the health of our employees, customers, and the communities we serve, including implementing detailed cleaning and disinfecting processes at our facilities, instituting temperature checks, adhering to social distancing and mask protocols, suspending non-essential travel, restricting visitors, providing remote work opportunities where possible, and offering on-site vaccination clinics to our employees, their families, and the general public. We have continued to monitor and update these procedures, in accordance with CDC recommendations and other local laws and regulatory authorities, throughout the pandemic.  
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we also implemented several measures to preserve liquidity and reduce costs in response to the significant disruption and economic uncertainty, including: 
  
• | Selling our majority ownership interest in eLuxury to increase liquidity and focus on our core mattress and upholstery fabrics business segments, while also maintaining a strong working relationship with eLuxury going forward through supply and royalty arrangements designed to preserve an additional sales channel for our core products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Repurposing some of our operations to manufacture critical products for healthcare and other essential industries;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amending our existing domestic revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing limit to $30 million, decrease the minimum liquidity level, and extend the expiration date to August 15, 2022;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proactively drawing down a total of $31 million under our domestic and China credit facilities as a precautionary measure to increase financial flexibility;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing operating costs by implementing temporary salary reductions, making workforce adjustments to align with demand, suspending merit pay increases, and eliminating cash compensation paid to our board of directors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Postponing non-essential capital expenditures and aggressively reducing expenses and discretionary spending;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Working with our vendors and landlords to negotiate temporary terms; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Temporarily suspending our share repurchase program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, following a better-than-expected increase in demand as customers and retail stores began to reopen, we returned substantially all of our previously furloughed workers to meet this surge in demand. We also repaid all outstanding borrowings we had previously drawn down under our credit facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and we ended temporary salary reductions by reinstating full base salaries for all employees and restoring the cash compensation paid to our board of directors. We also announced a $4 million investment in additional knit machines to increase capacity for our mattress fabrics segment. During the first quarter, our board of directors maintained our regular quarterly dividend by declaring a quarterly cash dividend of 10.5 cents per share. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expanded the capacity of our Haiti mattress cover operation with the completion of construction on a second building. In addition, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 11 cents per share, an increase of five percent, and this quarterly dividend rate was continued during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest in our Haiti sewn mattress cover platform from our joint venture partner, allowing us to gain sole control of this near-shore operation and increase our flexibility and capacity to meet customer demand. We also announced an additional expansion of our Haiti facilities to include a third building, expected to be available in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, that will be dedicated to producing cut and sewn upholstery kits primarily to support demand for an existing customer of the upholstery fabrics division.

Together, the actions taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and beyond helped us mitigate the financial impact of lower industry demand and shutdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that we were well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers as retail stores reopened and consumer demand for residential home furnishings surged during fiscal 2021. We continue to monitor and actively manage the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our operations, including pandemic-related constraints on customer capacity due to supply chain disruption for non-fabric components and labor shortages, as well as the availability and pricing of freight containers and raw material costs. The ongoing duration of the disruption and the affect it will have on our financial operations in the near and long term remain unknown and depend on factors beyond our knowledge or control. The need for any future actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic largely depends on the spread of the virus, including new variants, in the jurisdictions in which our business, our suppliers, and our customers operate, along with the adoption, effectiveness, and availability of vaccines; the status of government restrictions, directives and guidelines; the availability of workers and conditions for maintaining employee safety; global supply chain conditions; overall economic conditions and consumer confidence; the financial health of our customers, suppliers, and distribution channels; and consumer demand for our products, all of which are highly uncertain. As a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.

Additional financial information about our operating segments can be found in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 Mattress Fabrics. The mattress fabrics segment, also known as Culp Home Fashions, manufactures and markets mattress fabrics and sewn mattress covers to bedding manufacturers. These products include woven jacquard fabrics, knitted fabrics, and some converted fabrics. Culp Home Fashions has manufacturing facilities located in Stokesdale and High Point, North Carolina, and St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada. The division also sources products internally from Culp China, which is operated by our upholstery fabrics division, as well as from a supplier in Turkey, based on our own designs and production schedule. Additionally, Culp Home Fashions has a mattress cover facility in Haiti (which is now a wholly-owned operation following the fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest from its former joint venture partner), and also utilizes our Culp China platform for the production of sewn mattress covers. Knitted fabrics are produced at both the Stokesdale and St. Jerome facilities, while jacquard (damask) fabric is produced solely at the St. Jerome facility following consolidation of our weaving operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The majority of our finishing and inspection processes for mattress fabrics are conducted at the Stokesdale plant, while the St. Jerome plant provides 
 4


additional capacity and a second location for these processes. Both of these facilities offer finished goods distribution capabilities, and the Stokesdale plant houses the division offices.
 Culp Home Fashions had capital expenditures totaling $71 million during the past ten years, with especially high spending levels during fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2018.  These expenditures provided for increased knit machine capacity, faster and more efficient weaving machines, and the initial capital required for our sewn cover business, while also allowing us to maintain our leading-edge technology through modernization and expansion projects. These capital expenditures also provided high technology finishing equipment for woven and knitted fabric and a much-improved U.S. platform for warehousing and distribution, along with a new distribution facility in Canada.
 Our sewn mattress cover operation, established during fiscal 2013, has a manufacturing plant in High Point, North Carolina. This facility is leased by the company, and its operation involves a limited capital investment in equipment. In fiscal 2017, in response to continued growth in mattress cover demand, we entered into a joint venture with a third party mattress cover provider to construct a second leased location for our mattress cover operations in Haiti, and that joint-venture facility began production of mattress covers for our business during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We completed a 40,000-square foot expansion of this Haiti facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 to increase capacity, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired the remaining fifty percent ownership interest in this Haiti mattress cover business from our previous joint venture partner, giving us full control over the operation. We expect this strategic acquisition will enhance our ability to effectively manage our global cut and sew platform by further expanding our capacity and improving our flexibility to meet customer demand from this near-shore operation. As noted above, we also utilize our Culp China platform, operated by our upholstery fabrics division, to manufacture sewn mattress covers and to source additional sewn covers from third-party suppliers in Asia. These three manufacturing locations in North Carolina, Haiti, and China give us an on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore supply chain strategy that allows us greater agility in meeting demand for mattress covers from bedding producers. 
 Fiscal 2018 marked the completion of several multi-year capital projects for the mattress fabrics business, including consolidating certain operations, expanding capacity, improving efficiency and customer service, and maintaining our flexible approach to fabric sourcing. In fiscal 2019, we continued these initiatives by consolidating our weaving operations to one facility, our plant in Quebec, Canada, and expanding production of our sewn mattress covers in Haiti and China to meet customer demand in the growing boxed bedding market. Additionally, we continued to expand our design capabilities in fiscal 2019, launching new software and a library system for cataloguing our products to drive marketing and enhance innovation. In fiscal 2020, we further enhanced our design and innovation platform by establishing a dedicated innovation team to develop and offer the latest technologies and forward-looking products, expanding our creative team to complement our innovation strategy, and releasing a new digital library, design simulations, and 3D image rendering capabilities to showcase our designs and marketing tools. We were able to leverage these new technologies during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021, in the face of COVID-19-related travel restrictions and cancelled tradeshows, to continue showcasing our products and support our customers through virtual design collaboration. In fiscal 2021, we invested in additional knit machines and other equipment to expand fabric capacity in North America. We also enhanced our digital project management platform, which allows us to work with customers from concept ideation and 3D mapping to product life cycle management and final merchandising.    
 After eight consecutive years of growth, sales declined in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. The decline in fiscal 2019 was mainly attributable to the acceleration of low-priced mattress imports from China towards the end of fiscal 2018 and through the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, together with the increased acceptance by consumers of roll-packed/boxed bedding delivered through major online e-commerce channels. This disrupted the U.S. bedding industry and resulted in a decline in sales for domestic bedding manufacturers, which affected our business as a supplier to those manufacturers. Fiscal 2019 was also affected by major customer and retail disruption for certain of our core customers. The decline in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic during the fourth quarter, which has traditionally experienced higher sales for the mattress fabrics segment due to early spring seasonality trends. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our results for fiscal 2020 were also affected by continued disruption in the domestic mattress industry relating to low-priced mattress imports that moved from China to other countries.
 Sales increased significantly in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, which was materially affected by the COVID-19 disruption. This increase in sales was driven by the consumer focus on the home environment and overall comfort, combined with our ability to service this demand through our global platform. We also benefitted from market share gains across a diversified group of new and existing customers, including further growth in our sewn mattress cover business. Our fabric-to-cover model, as well as our on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore supply chain strategy, provided a preferred platform for our mattress cover customers. 
 Throughout fiscal 2021, the strength and flexibility of our global manufacturing and sourcing operations in the U.S., Canada, Haiti, Asia, and Turkey enabled us to support current demand and serve the needs of our fabric and cover customers. In addition, beginning in the third quarter, we believe the domestic mattress industry and, in turn, our business, began to realize some benefits from the preliminary antidumping duties imposed in October 2020 by the U.S. Department of Commerce on mattress imports from seven countries, and we are cautiously optimistic that this tailwind will continue in fiscal 2022.

Despite the challenging market conditions during fiscal 2019 and 2020, as well as the ongoing impact of COVID-19 during fiscal 2021, we believe our success over the longer term is due to our focus on product innovation and creative designs, service and delivery performance, and our flexible, global platform and long-term supplier relationships that allow us to meet changing customer demands. 
 Upholstery Fabrics. The upholstery fabrics segment markets fabrics for residential and commercial furniture, including jacquard woven fabrics, velvets, micro denier suedes, woven dobbies, knitted fabrics, piece-dyed woven products, and polyurethane “leather look” fabrics. With the acquisition of Read Window Products at the end of fiscal 2018, this segment also markets window treatment products and installation services, including roller shades, drapery, hardware, and top-of-mattress soft goods, for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries.
 Following the closure of our manufacturing facility in Anderson, South Carolina, during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, this segment currently operates two manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China. We market cut and sewn fabric kits produced in these locations, as well as a variety of upholstery fabrics and cut and sewn kits sourced from third party producers, mostly in China and Vietnam. Following the closure of our South Carolina facility, sales of non-U.S. produced upholstery accounted for substantially all of our upholstery fabric sales. Our China facilities in Shanghai include production of cut and sewn kits made to specifications of furniture manufacturing customers using sourced fabrics, as well as design, finishing, warehousing, quality control, and inspection operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we also commenced construction of a new facility in Haiti that will be dedicated to the production of cut and sewn fabric kits. This new facility is expected to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and will primarily support demand for an existing upholstery fabrics customer. We continue to expand our marketing efforts to sell our upholstery fabrics products in countries other than the U.S., including the Chinese local market. Additionally, we fabricate a variety of window treatments, using mostly customer-supplied fabrics and materials, at our facility in Knoxville, Tennessee.  
 Our upholstery fabrics business has moved from one that relied on a large fixed capital base that is difficult to adjust to a more flexible and scalable marketer of upholstery fabrics that meets changing levels of customer demand and tastes. At the same time, we have maintained control of the most important “value added” aspects of our business, such as design, finishing, quality control, and logistics. This strategic approach has allowed us to limit our investment of capital in fixed assets and control the costs of our products, while continuing to leverage our design and finishing expertise, industry knowledge, and important relationships.
 After six consecutive years of sales growth, sales declined in fiscal 2016 and 2017, mainly as a result of a weaker demand environment for upholstered furniture, before increasing by 10% in fiscal 2018 and 3.5% in fiscal 2019. However, sales declined in fiscal 2020 due to the severe disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic during the fourth quarter. Prior to this disruption, we were experiencing a solid year of annual sales, despite the soft retail environment for residential furniture and ongoing issues surrounding international trade agreements and associated tariffs during the first half of the year. In fiscal 2021, our sales recovered from the COVID-19 disruption with strong growth, driven by increased industry demand in our residential business, as well as the benefits of product innovation and opportunities with new and existing customers.  This growth was partially offset by lower sales for our hospitality business, which remained under pressure due to pandemic-related disruptions affecting the travel and leisure industries.  
 With the strong demand in our residential business, driven by an increased consumer focus on the home environment, our highly durable, stain resistant LiveSmart® performance fabrics, as well as our LiveSmart Evolve™ performance plus sustainability fabrics, remained popular with both existing and new residential furniture customers. These product lines continued to experience growth amidst consumer desire for cleanability, ease of maintenance, and environmentally-conscious products. We believe our success over the longer term is due largely to a business strategy that has included: 1) innovation in a low-cost environment, 2) speed-to-market execution, 3) consistent quality, 4) reliable service and lead times, and 5) increased recognition of and reliance on the Culp brand.
 Our progress has been achieved through a unique business model that has enabled the upholstery fabrics segment to execute a strategy that we believe is clearly differentiated from our competitors. In this way, we have maintained our ability to provide furniture manufacturers with products from every category of fabric for upholstered furniture and meet continually changing demand levels and consumer preferences. In recent years, we have implemented additional steps to grow net sales, including an emphasis on markets beyond residential furniture, such as the hospitality market. One result of these efforts was the acquisition of Read Window Products at the end of fiscal 2018, representing a significant expansion of our production capabilities in the hospitality market, along with the addition of window treatment installation services.
 Overview of Industry and Markets
 Culp markets products primarily to manufacturers and hospitality customers in three principal markets. The mattress fabrics segment supplies the bedding industry, which produces mattress sets (mattresses, box springs, foundations and top of bed components) and bedding accessory products. The upholstery fabrics segment primarily supplies the residential furniture industry and, to a lesser extent, the commercial furniture industry. The residential furniture market includes upholstered furniture sold to consumers for household use, including sofas, sofa-beds, chairs, recliners, and sectionals. The commercial furniture, fabrics, and window treatments market includes fabrics and window treatment products used in the hospitality industry (primarily hotels and motels); fabrics used for upholstered office 
 6


seating and modular office systems sold primarily for use in offices and other institutional settings, as well as commercial textile wall coverings; and window treatments for commercial application. The principal industries into which the company sells products – the bedding industry and residential and commercial furniture industry – are described in more detail below. Currently, a great majority of our products are sold to manufacturers for end use in the U.S., and thus the discussions below are focused on that market.
 Overview of Bedding Industry
 The bedding industry has contracted and expanded in recent years in accordance with the general economy, although traditionally the industry has been relatively mature and stable. This is due in part to the fact that a majority of bedding industry sales are replacement purchases, which are less volatile than sales based on economic growth and new household formations. Until recently, the U.S. bedding industry has largely remained a North American-based business, with limited competition from imports. This dynamic has mainly been due to short lead times demanded by mattress manufacturers and retailers, the customized nature of product lines, the relatively low direct labor content in mattresses, and strong brand recognition. Imports of bedding into the U.S. had been increasing gradually in recent years, but this trend significantly accelerated in fiscal 2018 and 2019, especially for lower-priced bedding. China accounted for the largest share of the imported units during these years, but the level of mattress imports entering the U.S. from China began to substantially decline beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 in connection with punitive anti-dumping duties imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, the level of mattress imports from other countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey, among others, significantly increased during fiscal 2020 as imports from China declined. The result of the increase in imports during this period, and continuing into fiscal 2021, has been a decline in sales for the major U.S. bedding manufacturers, which has affected major suppliers to those manufacturers, including Culp.
 As a result of the continued significant influx of low-priced imports that moved from China to other countries, anti-dumping duty petitions were filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) and U.S. Department of Commerce in March of 2020 against seven countries, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam, for engaging in unfair trade practices relating to low-priced mattress imports. A countervailing duty petition was also filed against mattresses imported from China. In May of 2020, the ITC issued a preliminary determination finding a reasonable indication that the U.S. mattress industry had been materially injured by unfairly traded mattress imports from these countries, and in October of 2020, the U.S. Department of commerce imposed preliminary antidumping duties on mattress imports from these countries. We believe the domestic mattress industry and, in turn, our business, began to realize some benefits from these duties during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, and we are cautiously optimistic that this tailwind will continue during fiscal 2022. 
 A key trend driving the bedding industry is the increased demand for roll-packed/compressed mattresses in both online and traditional sales channels, as consumer acceptance of boxed beds as a delivery mechanism continues to drive growth and increase market share for this product, increasing potential demand for sewn mattress covers. Another important trend is the increased awareness among consumers about the health benefits of better sleep, with an increased focus on the quality of bedding products and an apparent willingness on the part of consumers to upgrade their bedding. A further trend is the strong and growing emphasis on the design knitted or woven into mattress fabrics to appeal to the customer’s visual attraction and perceived value of the mattress on the retail floor, as well as in online sales channels and advertisements. Mattress fabric design efforts are based on current trends in home decor and fashion. Additionally, the growth in non-traditional sources for retail mattress sales, such as online e-commerce channels and wholesale warehouse clubs, has the potential to increase overall consumption of goods due to convenience and high traffic volume, which in turn results in higher turnover of product. Among fabric types, knitted fabrics have continued to increase in popularity. Knitted fabric was initially used primarily on premium mattresses, but these products are now being placed increasingly on mattresses at mid-range to lower retail price points.
 Overview of Residential and Commercial Furniture Industry
 Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding products, which is subject to variations in the general economy, including the current and evolving negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because purchases of furniture and bedding products are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products may be more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about future health and economic prospects can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decline in our sales and earnings. 
 Sales of residential and commercial furniture are affected by variations in the global economy, including economic downturns, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about future health and economic prospects. These market conditions, as well as the pace of recovery from these conditions, have been uneven in recent years. In general, sales of residential furniture are influenced significantly by the housing industry and by trends in home sales and household formations, while demand for commercial furniture generally reflects economic trends affecting businesses. During fiscal 2021, disruption relating to the COVID-19 pandemic also affected sales trends, with the increased consumer focus on the home and travel restrictions shifting discretionary spending away from travel and leisure activities towards home furnishings and enhancing comfort within the home environment.

The sourcing of components and fully assembled furniture from overseas continues to play a major role in the furniture industry. By far, the largest source for these imports continues to be China. Imports of upholstery fabric, both in roll and in “kit” form, have also had a significant impact on the market for upholstery fabrics in recent years. Fabrics entering the U.S. from China and other low labor cost countries have resulted in increased price competition in the upholstery fabric and upholstered furniture markets.
 In general, the residential furniture industry has been consolidating for several years. The result of this trend is fewer, but larger, customers for marketers of upholstery fabrics. Intense price competition continues to be an important consideration for both residential and commercial furniture.
 Additionally, with the ongoing global trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs during fiscal 2019 and the possibility for additional tariffs on China imports, some of our customers began altering their supply chains away from China in late fiscal 2019. While this trend continued in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, we believe Asia remains a preferred location for sourcing of components, including fabric.
 Products
 As described above, our products include mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics, which are our two identified operating segments. These fabrics are sold in roll form and as sewn mattress covers by the mattress fabrics segment, and in roll form and as cut and sewn kits by the upholstery fabrics segment.  Our upholstery segment products also include window treatments and related products.  
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Mattress fabrics segment sales constituted 53% of our total net sales for fiscal 2021, compared with 51% for fiscal 2020.  The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at prices generally ranging from $1.50 to more than $10.00 per yard. 
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 Upholstery fabrics segment sales totaled 47% of our sales for fiscal 2021, compared with 49% of for fiscal 2020. The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at “good” and “better” prices, generally ranging from $3.00 to $12.00 per yard. 
Culp Product Categories by Segment
 We market products in most categories of fabric that manufacturers currently use for bedding and furniture. We also market window treatment products to customers in the hospitality and commercial industries.

With the acquisition of Read Window Products at the end of fiscal 2018, the upholstery fabrics business also markets a variety of window treatment products and installation services for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries.  These products include roller & solar shades, drapery, roman shades and top treatments, hardware products, and soft goods such as duvet covers, bed skirts, bolsters and pillows.
 Manufacturing and Sourcing
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Our mattress fabrics segment operates four manufacturing plants, with two located in North Carolina (Stokesdale and High Point), one in St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada and one in Ouanaminthe, Haiti.  Over the past ten fiscal years, we made capital expenditures of approximately $71 million to consolidate our production facilities and to modernize both knit and weaving equipment, enhance and provide knit and woven finishing capabilities, and expand capacity. The result has been an increase in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating costs, as well as expanded product offerings and capacity.
 Knitted fabrics are produced at both our Stokesdale facility and our St. Jerome plant, while production of jacquard mattress fabrics was consolidated into the St. Jerome facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The majority of our finishing and inspection processes for mattress fabrics are conducted at the Stokesdale plant, with the St. Jerome plant providing additional capacity and a second location for these processes, along with distribution capabilities. We produce sewn mattress covers at our manufacturing facility in High Point, North Carolina, at our facility in Haiti, and at the manufacturing facilities of our Culp China platform in China. Our High Point facility is a leased space with limited capital investment in equipment. In fiscal 2017, we entered into a 50/50 joint venture with a third party mattress cover provider to construct a second leased location for our mattress cover operations in Haiti, and this joint venture facility began production of mattress covers for our business during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We completed a 40,000-square foot expansion of this Haiti facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 to increase capacity, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired the remaining fifty percent ownership interest in this Haiti mattress cover business from our previous joint venture partner, giving us full control of the operation. We expect this strategic acquisition will enhance our ability to effectively manage our global cut and sew platform by expanding our capacity and improving our flexibility to meet customer demand from this near-shore operation. Additionally, we utilize the company’s Culp China platform, operated by our upholstery fabrics division, to manufacture sewn mattress covers. These three manufacturing locations give us an on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore supply chain strategy that allows us greater agility in meeting demand for mattress covers from bedding producers. 
 In addition to the mattress fabrics and sewn covers manufactured by Culp, we have important supply arrangements in place that allow us to source mattress fabric and sewn covers from strategic suppliers. We source some Culp-designed knitted fabrics, certain converted fabric products, and sewn mattress covers using our Culp China platform. We also source Culp-designed sewn mattress covers from a strategic supply relationship in Vietnam. Additionally, we source a portion of our woven jacquard fabric and knitted fabric, which is obtained from a supplier located in Turkey, based on designs and a production schedule created by Culp. 
 Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 The upholstery fabrics segment currently operates two manufacturing facilities in China.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we closed our U.S. plant located in Anderson, South Carolina, which mainly produced velvet upholstery fabrics with some production of certain decorative fabrics. Additionally, we fabricate a variety of window treatments, using mostly customer-supplied fabrics and materials, at our Read Window Products facility in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Our upholstery fabrics facilities in China are located within the same industrial area in Shanghai. At these facilities, we apply value-added finishing processes to fabrics sourced from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we inspect sourced fabric there as well. In addition, the Shanghai operations include facilities where sourced fabric is cut and sewn to provide kits that are designed to be placed on specific furniture frames designated by our customers.
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we also commenced construction of a new facility in Haiti that will be dedicated to the production of cut and sewn upholstery fabric kits. This new facility is expected to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and will primarily support demand for an existing upholstery fabrics customer.
 A large portion of our upholstery fabric products, as well as certain elements of our production processes, are being sourced from outside suppliers. Our facilities in China provide a base from which to access a variety of products, including certain fabrics (such as micro denier suedes and polyurethane fabrics) that are not produced anywhere within the U.S. We have found opportunities to develop significant relationships with key overseas suppliers in China that allow us to source products on a cost-effective basis, while limiting our investment of capital in manufacturing assets. We source unfinished and finished fabrics, as well as a portion of our cut and sewn kits, from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China who are willing to commit significant capacity to meet our needs while working with our product development team located in China to meet the demands of our customers.  Beginning in late fiscal 2019, we also developed strategic supplier relationships in Vietnam for additional sourcing of our cut and sewn kits, which has allowed us to begin adjusting our supply chains to meet customer demands in conjunction with ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China. The majority of upholstery fabrics and materials used by our Read Window Products business to fabricate window treatments are customer-supplied. These materials are generally sourced by customers, and we also source a portion of other window treatment products such as hardware and roller shades, from outside suppliers in the U.S., Turkey, and China.
 Product Design and Innovation
 Consumer tastes and preferences related to bedding, upholstered furniture, and window treatment products change over time. The use of new fabrics, creative designs, and special production finishes and technologies remains an important consideration for manufacturers and marketers to distinguish their products at retail and to capitalize on changes in preferred colors, patterns, textures, and performance properties. Culp’s success is largely dependent on our ability to market fabrics and products with appealing designs and patterns, as well as performance properties such as cleanability, stain-resistance, cooling, and sustainability. The process of developing new designs and innovative finishes involves maintaining an awareness of broad fashion and color trends, as well as wellness and other consumer trends, both in the United States and internationally.
 In order to enhance our design and innovation creativity, we are launching a new innovation campus in downtown High Point, North Carolina, during fiscal 2022 that will advance the synergies between our mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics segments. This space will combine our design, innovation, and sales teams for both businesses into a shared location to support collaboration across divisions and pull our top creative talent together to develop new products and technologies based on the latest consumer trends.  
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Design innovation is a very important element of producing mattress fabrics. We invest significant resources to stay ahead of current design trends, including maintaining a trained and active design and innovation staff, investing in research and development activities such as participation in international design shows, and implementing systems for creating, cataloguing, and simulating new designs. Price point delineation for our fabrics and our customers’ finished mattress products is accomplished through fabric quality as well as variation in design. Consumers are drawn to the mattress that is the most visually appealing when walking into a retail showroom or viewing mattress products online, so this design variation, together with price point delineation, helps our customers merchandise different looks at various price points. Fiber differentiation also plays an important part in design. For example, rayon, organic cotton, and other special fibers, including recycled fibers promoting sustainability and fibers with cooling properties, are incorporated into the design process to allow the retailer to offer consumers additional benefits related to their sleeping experience. Similarly, many fabrics contain special production finishes that enhance fabric performance.
 Mattress fabric designs are not routinely introduced on a scheduled season. Designs are typically introduced upon the request of the customer as they plan introductions of new products. Additionally, we work closely with our customers on new design offerings around the major furniture markets such as Las Vegas, Nevada, and High Point, North Carolina.
 Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 The company has developed an upholstery fabrics design and product development team (with staff located in the U.S. and in China) with a primary focus on value in designing body cloths, while promoting style leadership with pillow fabrics and color. Our design staff travels regularly to international trade and design shows to maintain familiarity with current design and fashion trends. The team searches continually for new ideas and for the best sources of raw materials, yarns, and fabrics, utilizing a supply network located mostly 
 10


in China. Using these design elements, they develop product offerings using ideas and materials that take both fashion trends and cost considerations into account to offer products designed to meet the needs of furniture manufacturers and ultimately the desires of consumers.
 Upholstery fabric designs are introduced at major fabric trade conferences that occur twice a year in the United States (June and December). In recent years we have become more aggressive in registering copyrights for popular fabric patterns and taking steps to discourage the illegal copying of our proprietary designs.
 Distribution
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Most of our mattress fabrics shipments originate from our facilities in Stokesdale, North Carolina, and we have additional distribution capabilities in Canada, China, and Haiti. Through arrangements with major customers and in accordance with industry practice, we maintain a significant inventory of mattress fabrics at our distribution facility in Stokesdale (“make to stock”), so that products may be shipped to customers with short lead times and on a “just in time” basis.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 Most of our upholstery fabrics are marketed on a “make to order” basis and are shipped directly from our distribution facilities in Burlington, North Carolina, and Shanghai, China, and we have additional distribution capabilities in Vietnam. In addition to “make to order” distribution, an inventory of a limited number of fabric patterns is held at our distribution facilities in Burlington and Shanghai from which our customers can obtain quick delivery of sourced fabrics through a program known as “Culp Express.” We also have distribution capabilities for our “Culp Express” program to local customers in Canada through our mattress fabrics distribution facility in Quebec, Canada. Window treatment products sold through our Read Window Products business are done on a “job order” basis, with manufactured products shipped directly from our manufacturing facility in Knoxville, Tennessee to the job installation site.  
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of mattress fabric production costs. The mattress fabrics segment purchases primarily synthetic yarns (polyester, polypropylene, and rayon), certain greige (unfinished) goods, latex adhesives, laminates, dyes, and other chemicals. Most of these materials are available from several suppliers, and prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, the general rate of inflation, and particularly on the price of petrochemical products. The mattress fabrics segment has generally not had significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of upholstery fabric manufacturing costs for products the company manufactures. Prior to closure of the Anderson, South Carolina, facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, this segment purchased synthetic yarns (polyester, acrylic, rayon, and polypropylene), latex adhesives, dyes, and other chemicals from various suppliers. Following the closure, we ceased purchases of synthetic yarns and dyes, although these raw materials remain important to our suppliers of finished and unfinished fabrics.
 Increased reliance by both our U.S. and China upholstery operations on outside suppliers for basic production needs such as base fabrics, yarns, and finishing services has caused the upholstery fabrics segment to become more vulnerable to price increases, delays, or production interruptions caused by problems within businesses that we do not control.
 Both Segments
 Many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our raw material costs can be sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. From fiscal 2015 and continuing into fiscal 2018, our profitability was aided by lower raw material prices due to lower oil prices, among other factors. Later in fiscal 2018, we began to experience higher raw material prices. We had a significant escalation of polyester prices due to a global shortage of certain components during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2019, after which these prices stabilized and returned to pre-escalation levels. Our raw material costs were lower in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2021, our raw material costs were mostly flat or slightly down during the first three quarters, as compared to the prior year, but began to escalate during the fourth quarter primarily due to rising oil prices, a higher demand environment, and labor shortages.  We expect these pressures will continue in the short term, resulting in higher raw material prices during fiscal 2022, but prices may gradually flatten as market conditions normalize. 
 11


Seasonality
 Overall, demand for our products generally depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding products, which reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence, unemployment rates, and housing market conditions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the bedding and furniture industries, including manufacturers and retail stores, were adversely affected by closures/restricted operations, supply chain disruption, and economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Additionally, disruption relating to the COVID-19 pandemic also affected sales trends in fiscal 2021, with the increased consumer focus on the home and travel restrictions shifting discretionary spending away from travel and leisure activities towards home furnishings and enhancing overall comfort within the home environment. These impacts are not reflective of any seasonal trends in the bedding or furniture industries and are not an indicator that seasonal trends are changing for our business segments.
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 The mattress fabrics business and the bedding industry in general are slightly seasonal, with sales being the highest in early spring and late summer, with another peak in mid-winter.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 The upholstery fabrics business today is less seasonal than it once was. In the past, seasonality resulted from one-week closings of our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of most of our customers in the U.S. during our first and third fiscal quarters for the holiday weeks of July 4th and Christmas. This effect has become much less pronounced as the majority of our fabrics are produced or sold in locations outside of the U.S. The timing of the Chinese National Holiday in October and, to a larger extent, the Chinese New Year (which occurs in January or February each year), now have a more significant impact on upholstery sales than the U.S. holiday periods, often causing sales to be higher in advance of these Chinese holiday periods and sometimes lower during or immediately following the same periods.
Competition
 Competition for our products is high and is based primarily on price, design, quality, timing of delivery, and service.
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 The mattress fabrics market is concentrated in a few relatively large suppliers, as well as some niche producers focusing mainly on knitted products. We believe our principal mattress fabric and mattress cover competitors are BekaertDeslee Textiles (fabric and mattress cover producer), Global Textile Alliance (fabric and mattress cover producer), and several smaller companies producing knitted fabrics, sewn covers, and other fabric. In addition, our bedding customers continue to face increasing competition from imports of finished beds, which indirectly compete with our mattress fabrics by replacing potential sales of our products to those customers. 
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 In the upholstery fabrics market, we compete against a large number of companies, ranging from a few large manufacturers comparable in size to the company to small producers and converters (companies who buy and re-sell fabrics, but have no manufacturing). We believe our principal upholstery fabric competitors are Dorell Fabrics Co., Morgan Fabrics, Richloom Fabrics, Specialty Textile, Inc. (or STI), and ZhongWang Fabrics, plus a large number of smaller competitors (both manufacturers and converters).
 The trend in the upholstery fabrics industry to greater overseas competition and the entry of more converters has caused the upholstery fabrics industry to become substantially more fragmented in recent years, with lower barriers to entry. This has resulted in a larger number of competitors selling upholstery fabrics, with an increase in competition based on price.
 Environmental and Other Regulations
 We are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and federal and state environmental laws, as well as similar laws governing our manufacturing facilities in China and Canada. We periodically review our compliance with these laws and regulations in an attempt to minimize the risk of violations.
 Our operations involve a variety of materials and processes that are subject to environmental regulation. Under current law, environmental liability can arise from previously owned properties, leased properties, and properties owned by third parties, as well as from properties currently owned and leased by the company. Environmental liabilities can also be asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation.
 12


In addition, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and analogous state statutes, liability can be imposed for the disposal of waste at sites targeted for cleanup by federal and state regulatory authorities. Liability under CERCLA is strict as well as joint and several.
 The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to address climate change that is intended to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a determination that greenhouse gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment. International agreements may also result in new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. It is uncertain if, when, and in what form, a mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or regulation. However, if enacted, this type of program could materially increase our operating costs, including costs of raw materials, transportation, and electricity. It is difficult to predict the extent to which any new rules or regulations would affect our business, but we would expect the effect on our operations to be similar to that for other manufacturers, particularly those in our industry.
 We are periodically involved in environmental claims or litigation and requests for information from environmental regulators. Each of these matters is carefully evaluated, and the company provides for environmental matters based on information presently available. Based on this information, we do not currently believe that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on either the company’s financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the costs associated with environmental matters will not increase in the future.
 Human Capital
 Our Employees
As of the end of fiscal 2021, we employed 1,430 people, an increase of 33 employees as compared to the end of the prior fiscal year.  The mattress fabrics segments employed 993 people at fiscal year-end, an increase of 46 employees, while the upholstery segment employed 401 people, a decrease of 18 employees from the prior year.  The decrease in the number of employees in the upholstery fabrics segment in fiscal 2021, as compared to the prior year, was associated with the continued transition of some of our China cut and sew production to our strategic supplier in Vietnam.  The remaining employees comprise the company’s shared services functions.  Approximately 573 employees work in the United States, and 857 are employed in international locations. We employ the vast majority of our employees on a full-time basis.
 The hourly employees at our manufacturing facility in Canada (approximately 12% of our workforce) are represented by a local, unaffiliated union.  The collective bargaining agreement for these employees expires on February 1, 2023. We are not aware of any efforts to organize any more of our employees, and we believe our employee relations are very good with both our unionized and non-unionized workforce.  Our companywide annual employee turnover rate was approximately 18% during the past fiscal year. 
 Mission Statement and Values
 Our human resources department has adopted a mission statement that embodies our values and goals in the company’s relationships with our employees. The mission statement is as follows:
 Culp HR Services is committed to providing outstanding employee support in a mutually respectful, safe, diverse, and collaborative environment through innovative programming that engages our associates and promotes the success of Culp, Inc.
 
We strive to maintain a welcoming and inclusive workplace. Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, age, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, genetic information, disability, veteran status, or other status protected by law, as well as sexual harassment or harassment of any kind, are not tolerated in our workplaces. Employees have multiple avenues available to report inappropriate behavior, including a dedicated “HR Connection” phone line. All reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated and appropriate action is taken to prevent their recurrence. We also prohibit retaliation against individuals who, in good faith, report any violation of company policies, including unlawful discrimination or harassment.
 Along with our mission statement and values, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”), which sets forth expectations and guidance for employees to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as conflicts of interest, fair dealing, protecting confidential information, appropriate use of company assets, compliance with laws (including, without limitation, anti-corruption and anti-trust laws), workplace safety and environmental stewardship, and reporting Code of Conduct violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, ethical, and responsible manner, and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies. Our executive officers and supervisors maintain “open door” policies and any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited. 
 13


Employee Recruitment, Development, Engagement, and Wellness
 We strive to attract, recruit, and retain employees through competitive compensation and benefit programs that are aligned with those of comparable industries and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located, and in compliance with local regulatory requirements. We also provide development opportunities that support career growth and maintain a wide variety of programs to engage with our employees and promote overall wellness. We believe these efforts support all of our personnel in the workplace and elsewhere in their lives, which in turn aids in our employee satisfaction and retention. Examples include:

• | The Culp-grow program, providing employees with skills assessment and education assistance, such as GED, ESOL, and computer literacy programs
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employee participation in community outreach programs, such as a recent lunch delivery program to healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic and a clothing drive and collection of other critical supplies for our neighbors in Haiti
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monthly wellness sessions on various health-related topics
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Meetings and video chats with senior management
--+------------------------------------------------


• | The CulpVets program, which provides special recognition to military veterans
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employee awards and recognition programs
--+-----------------------------------------

 These engagement efforts and programs are continually refined and updated to meet the evolving needs of our workforce. 
 Safety and Health
 The safety and health of our employees is a fundamental priority at Culp. We maintain comprehensive safety monitoring and training programs, with regular reports to senior management on these topics. Our Behavior Based Safety initiative combines awareness programs, observation, and training to enhance continued compliance with safe and healthy practices in our facilities.
 Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, comprehensive protocols were developed and followed to allow our manufacturing plants to reopen safely after mandatory shutdowns. Part of our manufacturing capacity was retooled and adapted to produce personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks and other medical supplies. When Covid-19 vaccines became available, we hosted vaccination clinics at several of our manufacturing facilities, providing access to vaccines not only for our employees, but also for their families and members of the local communities.
 
Customers and Sales
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Major customers for our mattress fabrics include the leading bedding manufacturers: Serta-Simmons Bedding (SSB), Tempur + Sealy International (TSI), Nectar, Casper, and Corsicana. Our largest customer in the mattress fabrics segment is Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC, accounting for approximately 10% of the company’s overall sales in fiscal 2021. These sales include sales to customers who are also subcontractors for Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC. Our mattress fabrics customers also include many small and medium-size bedding manufacturers. 
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 Our major customers for upholstery fabrics are leading manufacturers of upholstered furniture, including Ashley, Flexsteel, Franklin, Fusion, Kuka, La-Z-Boy (La-Z-Boy Residential and England), and Southern Motion.  Major customers for the company’s fabrics for commercial furniture include HNI Corporation and Wyndham Destinations. Our largest customer in the upholstery fabrics segment is La-Z-Boy Incorporated, which accounted for approximately 13% of the company’s consolidated sales in fiscal 2021.

 For additional segment information, including the geographic location of long-lived assets, see Note 18 in the consolidated financial statements.
 Backlog
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 The backlog for the mattress fabric segment is not a reliable predictor of future shipments because the majority of sales for the mattress fabrics segment are on a just-in-time basis.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 Although it is difficult to predict the amount of backlog that is “firm,” we have reported the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog from customers with confirmed shipping dates within five weeks of the end of the fiscal year. On May 2, 2021, the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog with confirmed shipping dates prior to June 7, 2021 was $17.2 million, compared with $10.6 million as of the end of fiscal 2020 (for confirmed shipping dates prior to June 8, 2020). Due to the disruption relating to the COVID-19 pandemic during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, many customers delayed shipments that were included in the backlog for the fiscal 2020 year, but there were only minimal cancellations of orders. 
Intellectual Property
 We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks and copyrights for various product and trade names, logos, and fabric designs in the United States and certain foreign countries. We view such intellectual property, along with any unregistered copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies, as an important part of our business, and we seek to diligently protect, monitor, and defend, through appropriate action, against their unauthorized use.
