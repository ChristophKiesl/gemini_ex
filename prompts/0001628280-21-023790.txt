Item 1. Business
General
We are a leading operator of government health and human services programs worldwide. We are a responsible and reliable contracting partner to governments under our mission of Helping Government Serve the People®. Governments rely on our financial stability and proven expertise in helping people connect and use critical government programs. We use our experience, business process management expertise, innovation, and technology solutions to help government agencies run effective, efficient, and accountable programs.
Our primary portfolio of work is tied to business process services ("BPS") in the health services and human services markets. Our growth over the last decade was driven by new work, such as that from unemployment insurance and the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") in the United States ("U.S."), an evolving digital transformation to meet the modernization needs of our clients, and a growing footprint in clinical services including assessments, appeals, and independent medical reviews in multiple geographies. Our growth has been supplemented by strategic acquisitions.
Most recently, we experienced both favorable and unfavorable impacts as a result of the Coronavirus ("COVID-19") global pandemic. Underscoring the importance of the services we provide, many of our U.S. contracts were designated as "essential" by government agencies in the midst of the pandemic. Keeping these programs open assists vulnerable individuals and families to access vital healthcare and safety-net services during these uncertain times. While some of the programs we support have experienced reduced volumes due to the pandemic, we have also been successful in winning new contracts tied to public health initiatives such as vaccine information hotlines and unemployment insurance programs to help governments respond to the COVID-19 crisis. The individuals and families served under these programs are those considered some of the most vulnerable to COVID-19. As a result, we believe our operations support programs that are vital for their safety and wellbeing.
We continue to execute upon our three-fold strategy to accelerate our progress and drive the next phase of our growth through:
•Digital transformation. We are using digital technologies to transform the experience of our customers and our employees. We believe that these technologies can help our government clients run their programs in a more streamlined manner and make it easier for individuals to interact with these programs.
•Clinical evolution. We are expanding our clinical-related services and are experienced at delivering clinical BPS at scale. We have established an extensive set of services that frequently requires a network of healthcare professionals who can complete clinical assessments, provide occupational health and independent medical review services, and adjudicate complicated benefits appeals. With the formation of Maximus Public Health ("MPH"), we are able to serve as a resource to governments as they respond to public health threats. These efforts include providing health information and COVID-19 test results and vaccination information through our citizen engagement centers in key states and counties across the nation.
•Market expansion. We continue with our existing strategy to expand our markets by bringing our core capabilities to new programs and clients, adding new capabilities to access adjacent markets, and through geographic expansion. In fiscal year 2021, we expanded our clinical assessments and public health work, and completed two acquisitions in the United States to increase our digital and clinical capabilities, as well as create stronger relationships in key U.S. federal government agencies.
The macro-trends for our business remain unchanged. As the pandemic has underscored, governments around the world need better solutions to deliver on policy priorities that can change rapidly. Social welfare programs that reflect long-term societal commitments and priorities increasingly face rising demand, shifting demographics, and unsustainable program costs. Maximus is well positioned to address these challenges and be a transformative partner through our scalable, cost-effective, and operationally efficient services for a wide range of government programs.
To supplement our core business, we have an active program to identify potential strategic acquisitions to enable long-term, sustainable, organic growth by continuing to build scale, enhance our clinical and digital capabilities, and extend into new market areas. As we evaluate potential acquisitions to move forward in a strategic and thoughtful way, we are mindful that acquisitions must create long-term shareholder value. Our recent acquisitions further our progress on our long-term strategy.
•In March 2021, we acquired the Federal business of Attain, LLC ("Attain"). The additional capabilities from Attain meaningfully expand our technology consulting and growing systems integration skills, increasing our ability to address the most pressing information technology ("IT") needs of our Federal clients while providing internal opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of our business process services operations. Attain is delivering on complex program challenges for critical clients, while gaining the ability to bid on larger opportunities through newly available contract vehicles.
•In May 2021, we acquired Veterans Evaluation Services Group, Inc. ("VES"), a leading provider of Medical Disability Examinations ("MDEs") for the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"). This acquisition accelerates our clinical evolution to meet long-term demand for BPS with a clinical dimension. Prior to VES, approximately 15% of our work was clinical in nature whereas it now accounts for approximately 25% of our portfolio.
•In November 2018, we acquired the citizen engagement centers business previously operated by General Dynamics Information Technology.
These acquisitions, coupled with our 2015 acquisition of Acentia, LLC, provide increased scale, customer base, and competitive advantages in our business with the U.S. Federal Government. Our primary clients are national, state, and provincial government agencies.
For the year ended September 30, 2021, approximately 39% of our total revenue was derived from U.S. state government agencies, 42% from U.S. Federal Government agencies, 16% from foreign government agencies and the balance from other sources, including local municipalities and commercial customers.
Our Business Segments
We operate our business through three segments: U.S. Services, U.S. Federal Services, and Outside the U.S. We operate in the U.S., Australia, United Kingdom ("U.K."), Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Italy, Sweden, and South Korea.
For more information on our segment presentation and geographic distribution of our business, including comparative revenue, gross profit, operating income, identifiable assets, and related financial information for the 2021, 2020, and 2019 fiscal years, see "Note 3. Business Segments" within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
U.S. Services Segment
Our U.S. Services Segment generated 39% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021.
Our U.S. Services Segment provides a variety of BPS such as program administration, appeals and assessments, and related consulting work for U.S. state and local government programs. These services support a variety of programs, including ACA, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP"), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ("TANF"), and child support programs. Addressing societal macro trends such as aging populations and rising costs, the segment continues to execute on its clinical evolution strategy by expanding its clinical offerings in public health with new work in contact tracing, disease investigation, and vaccine distribution support services as part of the governments' COVID-19 response efforts. The segment also successfully expanded into the unemployment insurance market, supporting more than 15 states in their unemployment insurance programs.
Approximately 69% of our revenue for this segment comes from our comprehensive program administration services for government health benefit programs. The services we provide vary from program to program but may include:
•Program eligibility support and enrollment services to help beneficiaries make the best choice for their health insurance coverage to improve their access to healthcare.
•Centralized multilingual customer contact centers and multichannel, digital self-service options for simplified enrollment to better serve citizens' needs.
•Application assistance and independent health plan choice counseling to beneficiaries.
•Beneficiary outreach, education, eligibility, enrollment, and redeterminations services.
As a leading player in many of the health program administration markets that we serve, we believe:
•We are one of the largest providers of Medicaid enrollment services in the U.S.
•We are a leading provider of CHIP services and state-based health insurance exchange operations.
•We have established a sizeable presence in the public health market with vaccine distribution work and other COVID-19 response work.
Approximately 8% of the segment's revenue is from our independent appeals and person-centered assessments services primarily under Medicaid Long-Term Care. These services help governments engage with program recipients while at the same time helping them improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, quality, and accountability of their health and disability benefits programs. These include person-centered independent disability, long-term sick, and other health assessments, including those related to long-term services and supports such as Preadmission Screening and Resident Reviews ("PASRR") and Independent Developmental Disability ("IDD") assessments. We are a leading provider of such services in the United States.
Approximately 19% of the segment's fiscal year revenue is from employment and children services programs. Employment services cover a number of attributes, including eligibility determination, case management, job-readiness preparation, job search and employer outreach, job retention and career advancement, and selected educational and training services. Maximus supports more than 15 states and their efforts with unemployment insurance as a result of COVID-19. Children services include full and specialized child support case management services, customer contact center operations, and program and systems consulting services.
The rest of the segment's fiscal year revenue is from specialized consulting services.
Payment for our services varies from contract to contract based upon factors such as the priorities of the customer and the willingness to share risks and rewards. Some contracts are performed on a cost-plus basis, where we receive revenue based upon the hours and costs incurred and typically operate at lower margins. Most contracts include a level of performance-based compensation, a fixed fee, or a mixture of both, with fees being based upon call volumes, populations served, or appeals processed. Our workforce services contracts typically have outcome-based payments in an effort to incentivize providers to ensure that we help job seekers find long-term sustained employment and achieve economic independence.
The segment may experience seasonality due to transaction-based work, such as program open enrollment periods. Other fluctuations may arise from changes in programs directed by our clients and activity related to contract life cycles.
During fiscal year 2021, we earned 22% of our segment revenues from the State of New York. A small number of large states comprise a significant share of this segment's revenue. In addition, even though the majority of our direct clients are state governments, a significant amount of our revenue is ultimately funded via the U.S. Federal Government in the form of cost-sharing arrangements with the states, as is the case with Medicaid.
U.S. Services Market Environment
We believe that effectively managing healthcare costs, as well as improving quality and access to healthcare, is a major policy priority for governments. Further, President Biden has indicated that his healthcare platform will use the foundation of the ACA to expand access, lower costs, and simplify the process for individuals and families. Governments seek efficient and cost-effective solutions to manage their public health benefits programs. This includes programs meant to support individuals with disabilities and long-term medical conditions, as well as individuals with shorter-term health conditions.
In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, Maximus established itself in the public health market through our contact tracing, disease investigation, and pandemic response work. We believe there will be continued demand for a variety of services as states grapple with improving their long-term public health infrastructure in the wake of the global pandemic.
We believe the current market environment for our services positions us to benefit from continued demand across all of our geographies from service areas such as operations program management and independent health and benefit assessments. Overall, we still expect the underlying demand for our services to increase over the next several years, particularly as economies emerge from this global health crisis.
Our primary competitors are government in-sourced operations. External competitors include Conduent, Automated Health Systems, Faneuil, KePro, MTX Group, and Deloitte. In some services, we compete against specialized private companies and nonprofit organizations such as The Salvation Army and Goodwill Industries. We consider ourselves to be a significant competitor in the markets in which we operate as we are one of the largest provider of Medicaid and CHIP administrative programs and operate many of the state-based health insurance exchanges.
U.S. Federal Services Segment
Our U.S. Federal Services Segment generated 45% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021.
From technology solutions to program administration and operations, our U.S. Federal Services Segment delivers end-to-end solutions that help various U.S. Federal Government Agencies better deliver on their mission. This also includes appeals and assessments services, system and application development, IT modernization, and maintenance services. The segment also contains certain state-based assessments and appeals work that is part of the segment's heritage within the Medicare Appeals portfolio which continues to be managed within this segment. Benefiting from the Attain platform, the segment executes on its digital strategy to deliver technology solutions that advance agency missions, including the challenge to modernize, provide better customer experience, and drive process efficiencies. The segment continues to expand its clinical solutions with the acquisition of VES which manages the clinical evaluation process for U.S. veterans and service members on behalf of the VA. 
The segment further supports clinical offerings in public health with new work supporting the Federal Government's COVID-19 response efforts. This included:
•Expanded work with the Centers for CDC for their helpline;
•An outbound customer support center for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health to notify individuals throughout the U.S. of their COVID-19 test result; and
•IRS Wage and Investment Division response efforts to general inquiries regarding the CARES Act and Economic Impact Payment Service Plan.
Following the Attain and VES acquisitions during fiscal year 2021, we believe this segment is in a solid position to execute on our long-term organic growth goals as we are already seeing the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions to the combined companies and to our clients.
Serving as the platform upon which we will grow our IT services, Attain brings needed skills and experience and enables us to systematize how we conduct digital projects. Attain is comprised of the experts who helped successfully pioneer the first large-scale implementation of a cloud-computing solution for a federal department. They are a great team of problem solvers with inventive ideas, deep industry knowledge, and the proven capabilities of experienced leaders with track records of success.
Attain's core capabilities build further upon our cloud-based solutions and include:
•Application development & modernization: Modernize, develop, and deliver solutions utilizing automation, agile, and DevSecOps practices.
•Enterprise Business Solutions: Integrate and manage disparate business processes and systems.
•Advanced Analytics & Emerging Technologies: Provide technology services to leverage and integrate latest technologies for AI and machine learning, automation, and high-performance computing.
•Cybersecurity: Deliver full spectrum cybersecurity services including cyber engineering and operations, digital forensics, and incident response.
•Infrastructure and Engineering: Deploy solutions that leverage cloud-hosted and on-premise designs to optimize costs.
Attain has also built digital qualifications in the market. For example:
•Utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning to build bespoke data models, providing predictive analytics to maximize process efficiency, as well as identify systemic process issues that can be isolated and prioritized for troubleshooting.
•End-to-end automation of software development and business processes achieve speed, efficiency, and error reduction as well as advanced tool capabilities resulting in greater operational efficiency, enhanced customer experiences, and increased ROI.
•High performance computing clusters support mission requirements for data mining, scientific modeling, advanced analytics, research, and machine learning.
A leading provider of Medical Disability Examinations, VES brings a deep and longstanding relationship with the VA, as well as a team of experienced clinicians focused on serving veterans. VES physicians must pass rigorous credentialing and are trained on VA claims processing and veteran sensitivity before being approved to perform examinations. Clinic intake specialists, many of whom are veterans or family members of veterans, are onsite at nearly all examinations to provide a welcoming atmosphere. While domestically, our independent clinical assessments business has been growing at the state level (through our previous acquisition of Ascend and subsequent organic growth), VES' expertise will create a platform of scale for the first time at the Federal level. As a result, the independent health and disability assessments and appeals portion of our business will comprise a larger share of our overall portfolio, lending further credibility to our organic growth efforts with other Federal departments and in non-Federal markets. VES and Maximus will continue to support our nation's heroes through programs and services targeted at addressing the personal, health, and employment needs of veterans and their families.
Previous growth in this segment came from our acquisition of the citizen engagement centers business at the beginning of fiscal year 2019. Within the portfolio, three significant contracts were acquired.
•The contract to support the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ("CMS") Contact Center Operations ("CCO") was the largest contract acquired. We had served as a subcontractor on this contract since 2014. The end of period of performance for this contract is May 31, 2022. The new contract customer award timeline is anticipated for June 2022. This contract supports the federal exchange under the ACA and serves as the primary support engagement center for Medicare, also known as 1-800-MEDICARE. The contract serves the U.S. population through eleven customer contact centers handling general inquiries for the federal exchange and general and claims-based Medicare inquiries.
•The U.S. Census ("CQA") contract provided operations support and citizen engagement services to provide questionnaire assistance on the 2020 United States Census form. This contract ended in June 2021 following the completion of the Census.
•The CDC Information contact center provides assistance to individuals seeking the latest, reliable, and science-based health information on more than 750 health topics. Our relationship with the CDC was expanded in support of COVID-19 and vaccine information hotline needs.
Program administration business provides the majority of the segment's revenue. This includes:
•Centralized citizen engagement centers and support services;
•Document and record management; and
•Case management, citizen support, and consumer education.
Approximately 15% of the segment's fiscal year 2021 revenue is from our technology solutions. These include:
•Modernization of systems and IT infrastructure;
•Infrastructure operations and support;
•Software development, operations and management; and
•Data analytics.
Approximately 18% of the segment's fiscal year 2021 revenue is from our independent assessments and appeals services. These include:
•Independent medical reviews and workers' compensation benefit appeals;
•Medicare and Medicaid appeals;
•Medical disability exams; and
•Federal Marketplace eligibility appeals.
In October 2021, we acquired the Navient student loan contract, rebranded as Aidvantage, for which we will focus on the end-to-end borrower experience. We are an independent and conflict-free provider as we will not provide loan origination, consolidation, or collection services. We view student loan servicing as an opportunity to apply our insights, expertise, and quality-driven approach through support for Federal Student Aid ("FSA"), and student borrowers. Aidvantage is an extension of long-standing partnership to support FSA and is in line with our core business. Our focus is solely on supporting the student borrowers on behalf of FSA. 
Many contracts in this segment earn most of their revenue on a cost-plus or time-and-materials basis, which typically carry lower levels of risk and lower levels of profit margin as compared to performance-based contracts. The segment also contains performance-based contracts where revenue is earned based upon participant numbers or other transaction-based measures, such as the number and type of assessments or appeals processed. The segment may experience fluctuations as a result of volume variations or program maturity, with contracts recording lower revenue and profitability during program startup.
We have the scale, capability, and experience to offer our customer services in a wide range of areas. We have access to a number of significant contract vehicles across several agencies of the U.S. Federal Government.
The U.S. Federal Services Segment may experience some seasonality largely tied to our CCO contract that operates open enrollment for the Federal Marketplace and Medicare, which begins in November and ends in January.
U.S. Federal Services Market Environment
While federal agency budgets still face fiscal pressures and the administration is looking for improved efficiencies, we continue to see opportunities to apply our cost-effective and efficient solutions to serve citizens in the federal market. Federal agencies are tasked with cost-effectively managing programs at a time when changing demographics are leading to rising caseloads in many federal programs.
Many federal agencies must also address the maintenance of legacy IT systems and the pressing need for IT infrastructure modernization continues to grow. Legacy processes and systems are fundamental to government operations, yet they are expensive to operate in an environment that requires online agility and rapid response to new demands, requirements, and global challenges. We believe we are well-positioned to help agencies modernize and operate their mission-critical systems.
Key factors that will likely impact the U.S. federal services market include a variety of political, economic, social, and technological issues:
•President Biden's ability to implement his stated health platform that will leverage and build upon the ACA;
•A focus on the citizen experience, citizen services, omnichannel engagement, and digital services;
•Agencies moving from transformation initiatives to operations and maintenance;
•Agencies seeking consolidation and shared services to achieve cost efficiencies; and
•Changes in the acquisition and contracting environment, including consolidation of contract vehicles, such as Alliant 2 Government-wide Acquisition Contract.
Our primary competitors in the U.S. Federal Services Segment are Serco, General Dynamics Information Technology, PAE, Cognosante, and Conduent. Within the technology sector, our primary competitors are IBM, Oracle, Leidos, Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton, and other federal contractors.
Outside the U.S. Segment
Our Outside the U.S. Segment generated 16% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021.
Our Outside the U.S. Segment provides BPS for international governments and commercial clients, transforming the lives of people around the world. Helping people find employment, access vital support, and remain healthy, these services include health and disability assessments, program administration for employment services, wellbeing solutions, and other job seeker related services. We support programs and deliver services in the U.K., including the Health Assessment Advisory Service ("HAAS"), the Work & Health Programme, Fair Start, and Restart; Australia, including jobactive and the Disability Employment Service; Canada, including Health Insurance British Columbia and the Employment Program of British Columbia; in addition to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, and Sweden, where we predominantly provide employment support and job seeker services.
Approximately 51% of the segment's fiscal year 2021 revenue is from comprehensive employment services that help vulnerable individuals transition from government assistance programs to sustainable employment and economic independence. These services cover a number of attributes, including eligibility determination, case management, job-readiness preparation, job search and employer outreach, job retention and career advancement, and selected educational and training services. Payment terms are typically focused on achieving employment outcomes.
Appeals and assessments work constitutes 32% of this segment's revenue. On these contracts, we are typically reimbursed for each transaction. The HAAS contract is a hybrid contract with cost-plus elements coupled with a number of incentives and penalties to achieve the programmatic outcomes defined by the government in order to ensure quality and timeliness of service to the customers we serve. Maximus carries out these assessments on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions ("DWP"), and the DWP makes the final decision on the level of benefit. In fiscal year 2021, face-to-face assessments under the HAAS program were paused due to the global pandemic. We have resumed limited telephone assessment and paper-based assessment, but we do not know for certain when face-to-face assessments will resume. The HAAS program serves some of the country's most vulnerable citizens, and ensuring a safe return to face-to-face assessments is a top priority for DWP and Maximus.
The balance of the segment provides program administration and some specialized services.
Our competitive position within each national market is different. Within the United Kingdom and Australia, we consider ourselves to be leading providers of services in those markets.
Seasonality is not significant to this segment.
Outside the U.S. Market Environment
We believe our established presence, healthy financial condition, strong brand recognition, and ability to achieve the requisite performance requirements and outcomes make us well-positioned to compete for opportunities outside the U.S.
We offer clients demonstrated results and decades of proven experience in administering workforce services programs in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, and Sweden. In Australia, we are one of the largest workforce services providers, and in the U.K., we have an established presence and exceptional reputation in the workforce services market. This segment's significant employment services contracts continue to operate at reduced levels as these economies wrestle to emerge from the global pandemic.
As different geographies emerge from the pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic that new procurements for expanded employment services programs will materialize. Given our deep experience, strong financial condition, and trusted brand reputation, we believe we are well-positioned with unique competitive advantages to meet an anticipated expanded need for our services and pent-up demand to help governments provide their citizens employment opportunities. Furthermore, this segment has historically benefited from increased caseloads in employment services programs during past economic downturns.
Over the last five years, many governments shifted their focus to employment programs that serve individuals with disabilities or health conditions. We increased our presence in the U.K. disability employment services market, where we help people with disabilities and health conditions obtain employment. We do similar work in Australia under the Disability Employment Services program that aims to provide individuals with disabilities a supported path towards long-term employment. We are a recognized leader in the U.K. and Australia for providing disability employment support services, having achieved accreditation in the U.K. as a Disability Confident Leader and in Australia as a Disability Confident Recruiter. We believe these services are transferable to our other geographies and position us well for emerging trends in the disability services market.
We believe ongoing initiatives and our ability to achieve the outcomes that matter, reduce costs, and improve efficiencies, combined with our outstanding performance, expertise, and proven solutions, will continue to drive demand for our core human services offerings across multiple geographies. Our ability to provide value-for-money is important in a market that is price competitive.
Our primary competitors in this segment include Atos, Capita, Interserve, Virgin Care, Optum, Serco, Staffline, Shaw Trust, Ingeus, Sarina Russo, Advanced Personnel Management, IBM, Telus-Health, NTT Data, Pacific Blue Cross, and other specialized private companies and nonprofit organizations. Although the basis for competition varies from contract to contract, we believe that typical contracts are awarded based upon a mix of comprehensive solution and price. In some cases, clients award points for past performance tied to program outcomes.
Our Growth Strategy and Competitive Advantages
In all the markets and locations in which we operate, we are seeing consistent themes that drive our long-term strategy.
Demographics
•We are seeing increased longevity, driving more complex healthcare needs.
•Individuals are experiencing financial hardships and other barriers that require a combination of social safety-net programs and support into work.
We believe that programs that focus on measurable outcomes can cost-effectively address this need.
Decentralization
•Within the U.S., the U.S. Federal Government is exploring per capita funding and recently clarified federal regulations that now allow states the flexibility to use contractors to help agencies provide services. We anticipate future changes to this operating model as states evaluate options such as replacing staff, retaining contractors, and implementing technology. This operating model will be an important consideration as President Biden has made healthcare a major priority and is expected to build upon the ACA.
We believe that these changes to funding and government mechanics allows state and local authorities enhanced flexibility to shape their benefit programs.
Economic Environment
•As a result of the global health crisis, unemployment levels have drastically increased in markets around the globe. As a leading provider of employment services, we have historically experienced increased caseload volumes and an increased need for our services as we help governments tackle unemployment in order to support individuals back into sustained, meaningful employment.
We believe this will provide favorable tailwinds in our employment services portfolio as governments turn to companies like Maximus to help them manage the unemployment crisis as geographies emerge from the global pandemic.
Some of the competitive advantages that allow us to capitalize on various market opportunities are as follows:
Subject matter, clinical and digital expertise. Our workforce includes many individuals who possess substantial subject matter expertise in areas critical to the successful design, implementation, administration, and operation of government health and human services programs. We also employ a diverse set of experts, including a wide network of clinicians and an experienced team of digital champions. Many of our employees worked for governments in management positions and can offer insights into how we can best provide valuable, practical, and effective services to our clients.
Digital engagement, analytics and automation solutions to enhance government programs. Participants in government programs expect the same types of digital engagement they rely upon when interacting with consumer-oriented businesses. We believe our clients value our ability to infuse digital, such as mobile applications, omnichannel solutions, and digital media, into our BPS solutions to make it easier for beneficiaries to engage with government programs. Analytics enable us to optimize our operations and provide our clients with improved outcomes through greater insight into the populations we serve. Process automation incorporated into our BPS solutions increases the efficiency and quality of the programs we operate.
Flexibility and scalability. We are experienced in launching large-scale operations under compressed time frames. We offer clients the flexibility and scalability to deliver the people, processes, and technology to complete short- and long-term contractual assignments in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
Financial strength. Our business provides us with robust cash flows from operations as a result of our profitability and our management of customer receivables. In the event that we have significant cash outlays at the commencement of projects or where delays in payments result in short-term working capital needs, we may borrow up to $600 million through our corporate credit facility, subject to standard covenants. We have the ability to borrow under our corporate credit facility in all of the principal currencies in which we operate. We believe we have strong, constructive relationships with the lenders on our corporate credit facility. We believe our financial strength provides reassurance to government agencies that we will be able to establish and maintain the services they need to operate high-profile public health and human services programs.
Focused portfolio of services. We are one of the largest publicly traded companies that provide a portfolio of BPS almost exclusively to government customers. Our government program expertise and proven ability to deliver defined, measurable outcomes differentiate us from other firms and nonprofit organizations, including large consulting firms that serve multiple industries and lack the focus necessary to manage the complexities of serving government efficiently.
Established presence outside the United States. Governments outside the U.S. are seeking to improve government-sponsored health and human services programs, manage increasing caseloads, and contain costs. We have an established presence in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Italy, Sweden, and South Korea. Our international efforts are focused on delivering cost-effective welfare-to-work and health benefits services to program participants on behalf of governments.
Expertise in competitive bidding. Government agencies typically award contracts through a comprehensive, complex, and competitive request for proposals ("RFP") and bidding process. Although the bidding criteria varies from contract to contract, typical contracts are awarded based upon a mix of technical solution and price. In some cases, governments award points for past performance tied to program outcomes. With more than 40 years of experience in responding to RFPs, we believe we have the necessary experience to navigate government procurement processes and to assess and allocate the appropriate resources necessary for successful project completion in accordance with contractual terms.
Barriers to entry. The market for providing our services to government agencies is competitive and subject to rapid change. However, given the specialized nature of our services, market entry can be difficult for new or inexperienced firms. The complex nature of competitive bidding, qualifying criteria related to past performance, the required investment in subject-matter expertise, repeatable processes and support infrastructure, and the need to achieve specific program outcomes creates barriers to entry for potential new competitors unfamiliar with the nature of government procurement. In some areas of our business, notably contracts with the U.S. Federal Government, there are requirements for bidders seeking contracts to be pre-approved on registered contract vehicles, further limiting the pool of competitors.
Human Resources
As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 35,800 employees and 14,000 contingent workers, consisting of 9,600 employees in the U.S. Services Segment, 17,100 employees in our U.S. Federal Services Segment, 8,000 employees in the Outside the U.S. Services Segment and 1,100 corporate administrative employees.
Talent Acquisition
Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract talent globally in order to meet the needs of our customers and comply with our contracts. This makes our hiring efforts significant and extensive, and as a result, our talent acquisition team focuses on finding top, diverse talent quickly. We believe our culture values individual skills, experiences, and differences that allow Maximus to deliver robust and innovative approaches to solving some of our communities' most challenging needs. Our recruiting programs focus on identifying and evaluating talent through practices that welcome a diverse workforce, including people with disabilities, language barriers, and those from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.
In conjunction with the Biden Administration and Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") vaccine mandates, we are planning for implementation which includes extensive employee education and resources, paid time off and monetary incentives to receive a vaccination, and frequent reminders. Implementation of this mandate may result in workforce attrition and difficulty meeting our existing or future hiring needs.
Demand for talent is highly competitive with additional pressures influenced by the pandemic. We continue to invest in our employees through a variety of benefits and overall program enhancements. Our teams continue to adapt to the recruiting, hiring, and training needs of our customers in both remote and onsite settings to ensure continuity of vital services.
Talent Development
We value ongoing development and continuous learning, and we strive to support and provide learning opportunities to all Maximus employees. Maximus supports enterprise-wide professional development by offering a variety of instructor-led and self-paced learning programs for diverse audiences ranging from individual contributors to frontline supervisors and executive leadership. Additionally, our project training teams manage customized programs supporting contract requirements, customer service, local leadership development, and employee engagement. We also provide online learning tools that have role-based and skill-based paths to many of our employees.
Total Rewards
As part of our compensation philosophy, we must offer and maintain market-competitive total rewards programs for our employees to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include incentive bonus opportunities, restricted-stock units, company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and supplemental programs to support our employees' physical, mental, and financial well-being.
Diversity and Inclusion
Our mission of Helping Government Serve the People® has guided our business for decades. We assist some of the most vulnerable individuals and families each day. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to our company identity. We are proud to contribute to and positively impact our communities by treating every person we serve - and each other - with dignity and respect. We assert that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces creative solutions, innovative products and services, and attracts and retains key talent. We are focused on building an inclusive culture through a variety of diversity and inclusion initiatives, including internal development, promotions, and hiring practices. In 2021, we successfully sourced and employed more than 2,000 persons with disabilities in the U.S., and over 78% of our total U.S. hires were female. We continue to refine our focus on recruiting employees from under-represented groups, People of Color, and military veterans at all levels of the organization to better reflect the populations we serve.
COVID-19 Essential Services
Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we remained committed to supporting the health and safety of our workers, as many of our operations have been deemed "essential" by U.S. and international government.
Our main objective amidst this pandemic has always been and remains focused on protecting our employees, while ensuring global business continuity of our essential services to help vulnerable individuals. In addition to the health and safety protocols put in place in 2020, we have added a focus on encouraging vaccination as that has become much more widely available to our staff. While the tracking and employer approach to vaccinations varies widely across the globe, our U.S. operations put in place mechanisms to track vaccination status, offering paid time off to schedule an appointment and receive the vaccination, and provided financial incentives to staff who become fully vaccinated. Company-wide, we continue to see a much larger portion of our workforce working from home, when possible, in partnership with government clients for whom this has been a new model. We have also continued offering written education and live webinar opportunities for staff to learn more about the COVID-19 virus, the current safety protocols recommended by the CDC, and clinical information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Staff also have access to an Employee Assistance Program ("EAP") for mental health support throughout the pandemic.
Freedom of Association
As of September 30, 2021, 740 of our employees in Canada were covered under one collective bargaining agreement. The collective bargaining agreement is with the British Columbia General Employees' Union. This collective bargaining agreement expires in March 2022.
As of September 30, 2021, 1,523 of our employees in Australia were covered under a Collective Agreement, which is similar in form to a collective bargaining agreement. The Collective Agreement is renewed every four years.
As of September 30, 2021, 1,700 of our employees in the U.K. were covered under three collective bargaining agreements with GMB Trade Union and Unite Amicus Trade Union, Public and Commercial Services Union, and Prospect Trade Union. These collective bargaining agreements do not have expiration dates.
No other employees are covered under any similar agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Running our Business Ethically and with Integrity
Our commitment to conduct our business ethically and with integrity extends to our responsibility to respect human rights as guided by international human rights principles. It is our duty to conduct our business through responsible workplace practices as described in the Maximus Human Rights Principles, available at www.maximus.com.
We strive to be champions for an inclusive and collaborative culture that is free from discrimination and harassment, where everyone is treated with respect and dignity. Our expectation is that Maximus and its employees always conduct business according to the highest standards of ethics and performance and in compliance with all applicable laws.
Maximus has a confidential, third-party operated, 24/7 reporting ethics hotline. Violations of our ethics standards and policies are taken seriously and include remediation processes and disciplinary action, as applicable. Any director, officer, and employee may anonymously report suspected violations of the Maximus Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics, Company policies, or applicable laws and regulations.
The ethics hotline is a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool to assist management and employees in working together to address any type of misconduct in the workplace. Maximus is committed to an environment where open, honest communications are the expectation, not the exception. We want employees to feel comfortable in approaching a supervisor or anyone in management in instances where they believe violations of policies or standards have occurred. By creating open channels of communication, we aim to promote a positive work environment.
Employees understand our commitment to act with integrity, which is summarized in our Standards for Business Conduct and Ethics, which includes the confidential ethics hotline contact information and is available at www.maximus.com.
Government Regulations
Our business is heavily regulated. In the U.S., we must adhere to local, state, and federal laws and regulations. Within the U.S. Federal Services Segment, we must also comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"), which regulates the procurement, award, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. Outside the U.S., we must also comply with local laws and regulations as determined by geography, as well as U.S. government laws. Adherence includes human rights protections, environmental regulation, and contract specifications. Our government clients have strict policies, procedures, and requirements in the procurement process, as well as regulations governing contract pricing and reimbursable costs.
Our government clients maintain the role as data owners and regulate access to and use of this data through extensive federal, state, and international privacy and data security laws requiring certain privacy protections and security safeguards. The Company's Information Security Office is led by the Chief Information Security Officer to provide oversight over the Company's security obligations, as well as a Privacy Office under the Privacy Official to provide oversight over the Company's privacy obligations within these contracts. The Board of Directors Technology Committee provides oversight with respect to the Company's global IT, including, but not limited to, IT infrastructure, product development, digital services portfolio, cybersecurity, IT aspects of mergers and acquisitions, and intellectual property protection. Maximus uses various technological and procedural security measures in order to protect the personal information we collect from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. We have documented Information Security & Privacy policies to address data protection. We regularly provide information security and privacy awareness training to our employees.
Environment
Our operations may be subject to various local, state, federal, and international environmental laws and regulations. Given the nature of our business, we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with, or the liabilities associated with, environmental laws will materially affect us. However, we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future. The Board of Director's Nominating and Governance Committee has oversight responsibility for Environment, Social, and Governance ("ESG"), which includes climate-related risks and opportunities.
Legislative Initiatives
We actively monitor legislative initiatives and respond to opportunities as they develop. Much of our work depends upon us reacting quickly to dynamic changes in the legislative landscape to assist with implementation of new legislation. Over the past several years, legislative initiatives created new growth opportunities and potential markets for us. Legislation passed in all the geographies in which we operate can have significant public policy implications for all levels of government and presents viable business opportunities in the health and human services arena. Some legislative initiatives that created new growth opportunities for Maximus are as follows:
In 2020, four pandemic response bills, including the CARES Act, and new Medicaid waiver flexibility, were enacted to provide additional federal support to state Medicaid programs and prohibit states from tightening eligibility, thus helping to preserve Maximus' existing Medicaid and CHIP business. Most notably, for the first time, the CARES Act allowed states to hire contractors to support unemployment insurance call centers, eligibility determinations and verification of identities, and other data to reduce benefits paid to ineligible claimants. Maximus has won business with many states, as at least 41 states, according to the association of state workforce directors, took advantage of the new flexibility to address the surge of unemployment insurance ("UI") and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance ("PUA") applications. New state and local budgetary resources enacted in the American Recovery Plan Act ("ARPA") have created the need to work closely with clients to identify new opportunities to adjust the scope of work on certain contracts.
Enacted in 2010 and upheld through subsequent Supreme Court decisions, the ACA introduced comprehensive healthcare reform in the U.S. In our U.S. Services Segment, we help states with the operation of their health insurance exchanges, the expansion of their Medicaid programs to include new insured populations and the integration of state eligibility processing across multiple entitlement programs. In our U.S. Federal Services Segment, we also assist the federal government with the operations of customer engagement centers for the Federal Marketplace (including eligibility determination for Medicaid and CHIP for several states) and independent eligibility appeals services for individuals enrolled through the federal exchange.
A healthcare plan strategy continues to be a priority of the Biden Administration. We remain well-positioned to assist the federal government and individual states with future modifications to the ACA, including those made through a pending federalized Medicaid program in the Build Back Better legislation for the potential Medicaid beneficiaries in states that have declined to expand their Medicaid programs.
Section 1115 Waiver Programs. Section 1115 of the Affordable Care Act allows states to apply for waivers of certain requirements provided that the program changes are budget neutral and advance the goals of the Medicaid program. All fifty states currently operate at least part of their Medicaid programs under one or more section 1115 demonstrations. We support states' new long-term services and supports ("LTSS") initiatives that introduced more flexibility for Medicaid to cover long-term care and home and community-based services.
A minor negative factor for Maximus' state Medicaid business has been the Biden Administration's withdrawal of already-approved waiver and/or expenditure authorities – principally the community engagement or work requirements in the few states that had not had their programs terminated by the federal courts. It is likely that the Biden Administration will cancel all remaining Medicaid 1115 waivers that curb benefits or include work requirements, which would affect several states but is more than offset by the growth of the Medicaid and CHIP programs under the CAREs Act and the new business Maximus expects in early 2022 to help states handle millions of redeterminations of Medicaid and CHIP eligibility once states are allowed to remove beneficiaries who have ceased to qualify from the programs.
Work Innovation and Opportunity Act ("WIOA"). Signed into law in July 2014, WIOA replaced the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and took effect on July 1, 2015. The law coordinates several core federal employment, training, education, and literacy programs. It also requires states to strategically align their workforce development programs, with the option to include TANF, to help job seekers access the necessary support services and to match employers with skilled workers they need to compete in the global economy. WIOA represents potential new opportunities for us to complement our existing TANF welfare-to-work operations in the U.S. The Biden Administration has requested that Congress increase funding for these programs in the fiscal year 2022 president's budget request.
Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") Notice. In April 2019, OPM published a notice in the federal register encouraging states to exercise new flexibility to choose private contractors to support states' operation of federally funded, state-administered means-tested programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ("SNAP") and Medicaid. This additional flexibility allowed states to use companies like Maximus for rapid and scalable support of COVID-19 relief efforts such as unemployment insurance programs. The notice states that federal statutes and regulations "do not prescribe the use of a particular staffing method such as utilizing state employees or contract employees." We are exploring new businesses with several states and executed a contract vehicle with one. The new democratic administration of the U.S. Federal Government could reverse this notice, although a Republican Senate members and governors would likely challenge the administration.
United Kingdom Cabinet Office Procurement Policy Changes. In response to COVID-19, the U.K. Government released a series of Procurement Policy Notes (PPN 02/20: Supplier Relief due to COVID-19) to amend payment terms for major suppliers to ensure service continuity and put in place appropriate measures to support supplier cash flow. This meant that several payment-by-results contracts delivered by Maximus, particularly in our employment services division, moved to temporary alternative payment models, and contractual requirements were amended.
Community Involvement
We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We offer employees the opportunity to give back through the Maximus Foundation. The Foundation focuses our grant giving to carefully selected partners who have the expertise and capability to enhance our communities and the quality of life of the people we serve. We provide financial support for nonprofit organizations and charities that share our commitment in helping disadvantaged populations and underserved communities.
