Overview
Rogers Corporation (NYSE: ROG) designs, develops, manufactures and sells high-quality and high-reliability engineered materials and components for mission critical applications. We operate principally three strategic business segments - Advanced Connectivity Solutions (ACS), Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS) and Power Electronics Solutions (PES). We have a history of innovation and established the Rogers Innovation Centers for our leading research and development activities. Rogers was founded in 1832 and incorporated in Massachusetts in 1927. In August 2016, we announced plans to relocate our global headquarters from Rogers, Connecticut to Chandler, Arizona. The move will build upon our presence in Arizona, where we have significant business and manufacturing operations.

Our growth strategy is based upon the following principles: (1) market-driven organization, (2) innovation leadership, (3) synergistic mergers and acquisitions, and (4) operational excellence. As a market-driven organization, we are focused on growth drivers, including connectivity, clean energy and safety and protection. 
In November 2016, we acquired DeWAL Industries (DeWAL) for an aggregate purchase price of $135.5 million. DeWAL is a leading manufacturer of polytetrafluoroethylene and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene films, pressure sensitive tapes and specialty products for the industrial, aerospace, automotive, and electronics markets. We believe DeWAL’s business is highly complementary to our EMS segment, and we expect the acquisition to result in an expansion of our product portfolio and technology capabilities in the aerospace and electronics markets and other attractive industry verticals. 
In January 2017, we acquired the principal operating assets of Diversified Silicone Products, Inc. (DSP), a custom silicone product development and manufacturing business, serving a wide range of high reliability applications. We expect the acquisition to expand EMS’ portfolio of cellular sponge and specialty extruded silicone profile technologies and to strengthen our existing expertise in precision-calendered silicone and silicone formulating and compounding.
Our Business Segments 
We operate our business in three strategic business segments: ACS, EMS, and PES. The following table reflects the net sales of the reportable segments of the Company for the last three fiscal years:

Additional financial information regarding each of our reportable segments, along with information regarding our revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, is available in Note 16, “Business Segment and Geographic Information,” in “Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
Advanced Connectivity Solutions
Our ACS segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells circuit materials and solutions enabling high-performance and high-reliability connectivity for applications in wireless communications infrastructure (e.g., power amplifiers, antennas, small cells and distributed antenna systems), automotive (e.g., active safety, advanced driver assistance systems, telematics and thermal management), connected devices, (e.g., mobile internet devices and Internet of Things), wired infrastructure (e.g., computing, servers and storage), consumer electronics and aerospace/defense. We sell our circuit materials under various trade names, including RO3000®, RO4000®, RT/duroid®, AD SeriesTM and CLTE SeriesTM.
Our ACS segment has manufacturing and administrative facilities in Chandler, Arizona; Rogers, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Evergem, Belgium; and Suzhou, China.
Elastomeric Material Solutions
Our EMS segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells elastomeric material solutions for critical cushioning, sealing, impact protection and vibration management applications including general industrial, portable electronics (e.g., mobile internet devices), consumer goods (e.g., protective sports equipment), automotive, mass transportation, construction and printing applications. We sell our elastomeric materials under various trade names, including DeWAL™, ARLON®, PORON®, XRD®, BISCO® and eSORBA®. As noted above, we acquired DeWAL and DSP in November 2016 and January 2017, respectively. We are in the process of integrating these businesses into our EMS segment.
Our EMS segment has manufacturing and administrative facilities in Woodstock, Connecticut; Rogers, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Carol Stream, Illinois; Narragansett, Rhode Island; Santa Fe Springs, California; Suzhou, China; and Ansan, Korea. We also own 50% of: (1) Rogers Inoac Corporation (RIC), a joint venture established in Japan to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON products predominantly for the Japanese market and (2) Rogers INOAC Suzhou Corporation (RIS), a joint venture established in China to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON products primarily for RIC customers in various Asian countries. INOAC Corporation owns the remaining 50% of both RIC and RIS. RIC has manufacturing facilities at the INOAC facilities in Nagoya and Mie, Japan, and RIS has manufacturing facilities at Rogers’ facilities in Suzhou, China.

Power Electronics Solutions
Our PES segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells ceramic substrate materials for power module applications (e.g., variable frequency drives, vehicle electrification and renewable energy), laminated bus bars for power inverter and high power interconnect applications (e.g., mass transit, hybrid-electric and electric vehicles, renewable energy and variable frequency drives), and micro-channel coolers (e.g., laser cutting equipment). We sell our ceramic substrate materials and micro channel coolers under the curamik® tradename, and our bus bars under the ROLINX® tradename.
Our PES segment has manufacturing and administrative facilities in Ghent, Belgium; Eschenbach, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; and Suzhou, China.
Other
Our Other businesses consist of elastomeric components for applications in ground transportation, office equipment, consumer and other markets; elastomeric floats for level sensing in fuel tanks, motors, and storage tanks; and inverters for portable communications and automotive markets. In 2015, the Other businesses included the Arlon polyimide and thermoset laminate operations, which was the non-core divestiture in December 2015.
Sales and Competition
We sell our materials and components primarily through direct sales channels positioned near major concentrations of our customers in North America, Europe and Asia. We sold to over 3,000 customers worldwide in 2016, primarily original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and component suppliers. No individual customer represented more than 4.1% of our total net sales for 2016; however, there are concentrations of OEM customers in our ACS (Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturers) and PES (semiconductor and automotive manufacturers) segments. Although the loss of all of the sales made to any one of our larger customers would require a period of adjustment during which the results of a particular operating segment would be adversely impacted, we believe that such events could be successfully mitigated over a period of time due to the diversity of our customer base.
We employ a technical sales and marketing approach pursuant to which we work collaboratively to provide design engineering, testing, product development and other technical support services to OEMs that incorporate our engineered materials and components in their products. Particularly in our ACS and EMS business segments, component suppliers convert, modify or otherwise incorporate our engineered materials and components into their components for these OEMs in accordance with their specifications. Accordingly, we provide similar technical support services to component suppliers.
We compete primarily with manufacturers of high-end materials, some of which are large, multi-national companies, principally on the basis of innovation, customer relationships, product quality and performance, technical service, breadth of product line, and manufacturing capabilities. We also compete with manufacturers of commodity materials, including smaller regional producers with lower overhead costs and profit requirements located in Asia that attempt to upsell their products based principally upon price, particularly for products that have matured in their life cycle. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because of our reputation for innovation, the quality and reliability of our materials and components and our demonstrated commitment to technical support and customer service.
Research and Development
We have a history of innovation, and innovation leadership is a key component of our overall business strategy. The markets we serve are typically characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. Accordingly, the success of our strategy is in part dependent on our ability to develop market-leading products, which is primarily driven by efforts in research and development. We are focused on identifying technologies and innovations related to both our current product portfolio as well as other long term initiatives targeted at further diversifying and growing our business. As part of this technology commitment, we established the Rogers Innovation Center at Northeastern University in Burlington, Massachusetts, and, in 2015, opened an innovation center at our facility in Suzhou, China. Our innovation centers focus on the earliest stages of technical and commercial development of new high-tech materials solutions in close alignment with market direction and needs.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We have many domestic and foreign patents, licenses and have additional patent applications pending related to each of our business segments. These patents and licenses vary in duration and provide some protection from competition.
We also own a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and have acquired and developed certain confidential and proprietary technology, including trade secrets that we believe to be of some importance to our business.
6

While we believe our patents and other intellectual property provide a competitive advantage to our business segments, we believe that a significant part of our competitive position and future success will be determined by factors such as the innovative skills, systems and process knowledge, and technological expertise of our personnel; the range and success of new products we develop; and our customer service and support.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
The key raw materials used in our business are as follows: for our ACS segment, copper and polymer materials; for our EMS segment, polyurethane, polytetraflouroethylene, polyethylene and silicone materials; and for our PES segment, copper and ceramic materials.
Some of the raw materials used in our business are available through single or limited-source suppliers. We have expanded our supplier base for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency, cost reduction and quality and have sought to limit the number of suppliers who act as the single-source supplier for a particular raw material. We seek to mitigate the impact of raw material supply disruptions by purchasing sufficient quantities of the particular raw material in advance to sustain production until alternative materials and production processes can be qualified with customers. However, this strategy may not be effective in all cases, and disruptions in our supply of raw materials could negatively impact our production and have a material adverse impact on our business.
Seasonality
Except for some minor seasonality for consumer products, which often aligns with year-end holidays and product launch cycles, the operations of our segments have not been seasonal.
Our Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,100 people, including DeWAL employees.
Backlog 
Our backlog of firm orders was $106.5 million as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $63.3 million as of December 31, 2015. ACS, EMS, PES, and Other operating segments experienced year over year increases in backlog of $13.2 million, $15.8 million, $13.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Contributing to the year over year change in backlog was an improvement in general market conditions. Additionally, the 2016 backlog contains $7.2 million related to the DeWAL business. The backlog of firm orders is expected to be filled within the next 12 months.
