ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company 
 When used in this report, the terms Cott, the Company, our Company, Cott Corporation, we, us, or our mean Cott Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. 
 We incorporated in 1955 and are governed by the Canada Business Corporations Act. Our registered Canadian office is located at 333 Avro Avenue, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada H9R 5W3 and our principal executive offices are located at 5519 W. Idlewild Avenue, Tampa, Florida, United States 33634 and 6525 Viscount Road, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L4V 1H6. 
 Cott is a diversified beverage company with a leading volume-based national presence in the North America and European home and office delivery (HOD) industry for bottled water, a leader in custom coffee roasting and blending of iced tea for the U.S. foodservice industry, and a leader in the production of beverages on behalf of retailers, brand owners and distributors. Our platform reaches over 2.3 million customers or delivery points across North America and Europe supported by strategically located sales and distribution facilities and fleets, as well as wholesalers and distributors. This enables us to efficiently service residences, businesses, restaurant chains, hotels and motels, small and large retailers, and healthcare facilities. 
 We completed several material acquisitions in 2016: 
 

 | On January 4, 2016, we acquired Aquaterra Corporation (Aquaterra) pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated December 7, 2015 (the Aquaterra Acquisition). Aquaterra operates a Canadian direct-to-consumer HOD bottled water and office coffee services (OCS) business. The aggregate purchase price of C$61.2 million (U.S. $44.0 million) was paid in cash on hand.

 | On August 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Eden Springs Europe B.V. (Eden), a leading provider of water and coffee solutions in Europe (the Eden Acquisition). The purchase price paid was 515.9 million (U.S. $576.3 million). The Eden Acquisition was funded through a combination of proceeds from the issuance of 450 million of 5.50% senior notes due July 1, 2024 (the 2024 Notes) and cash on hand.

 | On August 11, 2016, we completed the acquisition of S. & D. Coffee, Inc. (S&D), a premium coffee roaster and provider of customized coffee, tea, and extract solutions to the foodservice, convenience, gas, hospitality and office segments in the United States (the S&D Acquisition). The purchase price paid was $353.6 million. The S&D Acquisition was funded through a combination of incremental borrowings under our asset-based lending facility (the ABL facility) and proceeds from our June 2016 public offering of common shares.

Our Operations 
 At the beginning of 2016, our business operated through four reporting segments: DSS, Cott North America, Cott United Kingdom (Cott U.K.) and All Other (which includes our Mexico and Royal Crown International (RCI) operating segments). Aquaterra was added to the DSS reporting segment upon its acquisition; following the completion of the Eden Acquisition and the S&D Acquisition, these businesses were added to our DSS reporting segment, which was then renamed Water & Coffee Solutions to reflect the increased scope of our offering. Other than the change in name, there was no impact on prior period results for this reporting segment. 
 We refer to our Cott North America, Cott U.K. and All Other reporting segments together as our traditional business. Our corporate oversight function is not treated as a segment; it includes certain general and administrative costs that are not allocated to any of the reporting segments. 
 Water & Coffee Solutions
Our Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment provides bottled water, coffee and water filtration services to customers in North America, Europe, and Israel. Water & Coffee Solutions products include bottled water, coffee, brewed tea, water dispensers, coffee and tea brewers and filtration equipment. Water & Coffee Solutions net revenue was 
 
1 
 
 $1,452.3 million, $1,021.1 million and $28.7 million, and represented 44.9%, 34.7% and 1.4% of our total net revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015 reflects two weeks of Water & Coffee Solutions operations following the closing of the acquisition of DS Services of America, Inc. (DSS) in December 2014 (the DSS Acquisition)). 
 Traditional Business
Our traditional business consists of our Cott North America, Cott U.K. and All Other reporting segments. 
 Our traditional business produces, either directly or through third-party manufacturers with whom we have co-packing arrangements, carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), 100% shelf stable juice and juice-based products, clear, still and sparkling flavored waters, energy drinks and shots, sports drinks, new age beverages, ready-to-drink teas, liquid enhancers, freezables, ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages, hot chocolate, coffee, malt drinks, creamers/whiteners, cereals and beverage concentrates. Cott North Americas net revenue from external customers was $1,263.3 million, $1,308.3 million and $1,411.2 million, and represented 39.0%, 44.4% and 67.1% of our total net revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cott U.K.s net revenue was $469.8 million, $557.0 million, and $597.9 million, and represented 14.5%, 18.9%, and 28.4% of our total net revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. All Others net revenue was $50.5 million, $57.6 million, and $65.0 million, and represented 1.6%, 2.0%, and 3.1% of our total net revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Competitive Strengths 
 The combination of our scale and density of our routes in key markets, our industry-leading infrastructure, and our emphasis on superior customer service is intended to create significant competitive strengths. With respect to our Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment, we continually invest in our delivery infrastructure, call centers and service capabilities to maintain our established position as a leader in this segment. We believe these investments have positioned us to capitalize on a number of positive industry dynamics and new growth opportunities. First, we intend to capture new customers as we capitalize on favorable consumer trends across our addressable markets, including increased focus on health and wellness, concerns about deteriorating municipal water quality and the shift to premium coffee systems and on the go coffee and tea purchases. Second, we believe our ability to cross-sell complementary water and coffee products and services represents a significant untapped opportunity. Third, the highly fragmented market in which we operate affords us ample opportunity to make the most of our scale, systems and customer density to execute synergistic tuck-in acquisitions across all of our service areas. We believe these strengths, along with the strengths outlined below, will allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities to drive sustainable and profitable growth. 
Leading Position in Multiple Beverage Categories with Diverse Products and Services Portfolio 
 With the acquisition of DSS in 2014, we combined a leading provider in the direct-to-consumer beverage services industry in the United States with our traditional business, a leader in the production of beverages on behalf of retailers, brand owners and distributors. With the acquisitions of S&D, Eden and Aquaterra in 2016, we further diversified our offering across multiple channels and geographies, supporting our continuing strategy to acquire higher margin and/or growth HOD bottled water, coffee and tea categories. 
 We now have a leading volume-based national presence in the North America and European HOD industry for bottled water, we are a leader in custom coffee roasting and blending of iced tea for the U.S. foodservice industry, and we are a leader in the production of beverages on behalf of retailers, brand owners and distributors. In bottled water, we offer a portfolio of well-known brands with longstanding heritages, such as Sparkletts, Hinckley Springs, Kentwood Springs, Canadian Springs, Labrador and Eden Springs, which have contributed to our leadership position in the HOD industry. In OCS, we offer a complete range of products under leading brands including Keurig®, Mars Alterra®, Starbucks® Coffee, Caribou Coffee®, Peets Coffee & Tea®, Javarama® and Lavazza®. We are one of the only direct-to-customer providers that can offer comprehensive services to residential customers and small and medium-sized businesses, as well as large regional and national corporations and retailers, universities and government agencies. Our broad direct-to-consumer network creates an advantage in marketing and customer reach, while our extensive range of products and capabilities allows us to offer customers a convenient, single solution for coffee, tea and high quality drinking water. We believe our position will be further strengthened through our ongoing efforts to enhance and promote our full-service beverage offering to new and existing customers. 
 Our traditional business focuses on marketing or supplying licensed, retailer- and Company-owned brands, as well as manufacturing beverages on a contract basis for national brand customers. We produce (either directly or through third-party manufacturers with whom we have co-packing agreements) a significant portion of all retailer brand CSDs and juice sold in North America, as well as a significant portion of all retailer brand CSDs, sports and energy products sold in the United Kingdom. We also sell CSD concentrates and non-carbonated concentrates internationally. 
 
2 
 
As a producer of beverages on behalf of retailers, brand owners and distributors, we have a diversified product portfolio across major beverage categories, including beverages that are on-trend with consumer demand. We believe that our position as a market leader, our broad portfolio offering and our existing infrastructure will enable us to continue to penetrate the contract manufacturing, private-label and value brand markets, whether by winning new customers, launching new product stock keeping units (SKUs) with existing customers, or supplying retailers who currently self-manufacture. 
 We also believe that opportunities exist to increase sales of our products in our core markets by optimizing existing customer relationships, capitalizing on cross-selling and up-selling opportunities, obtaining new customers, manufacturing beverages (including alcoholic beverages) on a contract basis for new and existing customers, exploring new channels of distribution and introducing new products through our broad reaching distribution network. 
 Extensive, Flexible Manufacturing and Distribution Capabilities 
 We own a national production and distribution network for HOD, OCS and filtration services, serving over 1.5 million customers in the United States and Canada. DSS operates a national footprint of branch distribution facilities, combined production and distribution facilities and over 2,000 direct-to-consumer routes. The Aquaterra business has a leading position in the Canadian HOD market. We believe that having one of the leading North American HOD production and distribution networks in the industry gives us the ability to reduce our purchasing, manufacturing and delivery costs relative to our competitors as well as drive customer density within the markets we serve. 
 Eden further expanded our European capabilities and is highly complementary to our existing footprint. We believe that our large distribution footprint in the water-and-coffee solutions space in Europe differentiates us from our competitors, providing us with nationwide coverage for our most significant businesses and allowing us to meet the water and coffee needs of our diversified customer base, including both small and medium sized businesses and larger national customer accounts. 
 The addition of S&D makes us a leader in custom coffee roasting and blending of foodservice iced teas in the United States. We believe the combination of S&Ds premium quality products and solutions, sourcing and distribution reach, and human capital assets create unmatched custom coffee, tea and extract production capabilities. 
 Manufacturing flexibility is one of the core competencies within our traditional business and is critical to our success, as our products will typically feature customized packaging, design and graphics for our key customers. We believe our national manufacturing platform, as well as the ability to produce multiple SKUs and packages on our production lines and manage complexities through quick-line changeover processes, differentiates us from our competition. In our traditional business, our products are either picked up by our customers at our facilities or delivered by us, a common carrier, or third-party distributors to our customers distribution centers, or to retail or wholesaler locations. 
 High Levels of Customer Service and Strong Customer Integration 
 Customer service and customer retention are key indicators of success within our Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment. Route Sales Representatives or RSRs, who comprise the consumer-facing part of the business, are an important part of the customer relationship and not only drives customer service, but also generates new organic customer growth. Our Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment provides reliable deliveries and closely tracks call center and customer service metrics to continually improve customer satisfaction. 
 Our traditional business requires a high level of coordination with our customers in areas such as supply chain, product development and customer service. In addition to efficiently managing complex product manufacturing, we have a proven track record of maintaining high service levels across our customer base. We partner closely with customers on supply chain planning and execution to minimize freight costs, reduce working capital requirements and increase in-store product availability. We work as partners with our customers on new product development and packaging designs. Our role includes providing market expertise as well as knowledge of category trends that may present opportunities for our customers. A high level of customer integration and partnership coupled with an international manufacturing footprint is critical for the development of successful beverage programs for our customers.

Strategic Importance to Our Customers 
 We have an extensive HOD and OCS distribution network with a unique ability to service customers. We believe few companies have a comparable footprint or infrastructure to support local, regional and national accounts directly, which differentiates us in the industry. Our scaled network has allowed us to secure strategic relationships, which have been successful in attracting new customers and leveraging our production and delivery infrastructure. We are able to provide multiple products to our HOD and OCS customers at minimal additional cost and generate additional profits on those incremental sales. 
 For 2016, our top 10 customers accounted for 29.1% of total revenue. Walmart accounted for 15.7% of our total revenue for the year. We have established long-standing relationships with most of our top 10 customers. As a result of our high product quality and commitment to service, coupled with an international manufacturing and distribution footprint, we believe we will continue to play a meaningful role in helping our customers develop strategies to build loyalty with consumers. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our vision is to continue to strengthen the business and progressively move Cott from a position of volume stability to one with topline growth and a higher margin profile thereby creating a business with higher free cash flows, lower customer concentration, and hence lower risk. This future business profile should offer greater earnings predictability and increased cash flow alongside lower volatility. Our vision combines four elements: (1) focus on growth of the Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment, (2) capture synergies related to our recent acquisitions, (3) grow contract manufacturing and other health and wellness focused beverage categories in our traditional business in order to offset the general and market declines seen in CSDs and shelf stable juices and (4) reduce interest expense and debt leverage while continuing to evaluate acquisition opportunities. We believe that executing on these four elements will collectively create a highly cash generative business, in higher margin, stable-to-growing Better For You beverage categories distributed through multiple channels with a reduced dependence on large format retailers. 
Focus on Water & Coffee Solutions Growth 
 Organic Growth 
 Our goal is to position the Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment to grow the business profitably as consumers move to healthier beverage options, and increase free cash flow by focusing on expanding the customer base and price improvement. 
 The Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment will remain focused on expanding its small and medium-sized business customer base, a market segment that we believe remains underpenetrated, by continuing to capitalize on our strong direct-to-consumer distribution network, national sales and marketing efforts as well as our strategic partnerships. Our nationwide coverage provides us with a significant advantage in competing for national commercial accounts, which is an additional component of our distribution strategy and marketing efforts. 
 We believe our ability to cross-sell complementary water and coffee products and services represents a significant untapped opportunity as nearly all of our existing and target customers consume both products. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity utilizing our strong relationships and frequent face-to-face interactions with our large installed customer base. RSRs are trained to sell across our product set and are highly incentivized through our commission structure to promote new products to existing customers, which increases sales and average revenue per customer. 
 Pursue Synergistic HOD Water, OCS and Filtration Tuck-In Acquisitions 
 We intend to proactively pursue accretive acquisitions to complement our organic growth. The highly fragmented market in which we operate affords us ample opportunities to execute synergistic HOD water, OCS and filtration tuck-in acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is consistent with our objective to continually build customer density and reduce the overall cost of servicing our existing customer base. We have a proven track record of achieving significant synergies and integrating companies onto our platform and we believe we will continue to improve our profitability and margins through acquisitions. 
 We have managed to pursue this acquisition strategy while reducing leverage levels from the time of the DSS Acquisition by employing a combination of disciplined purchase pricing, successful integration and synergy realization.

Synergy Capture and Integration 
 As we focus on synergy capture and continue to integrate acquired businesses, our goal is to minimize any integration distractions and enable the businesses to continue to grow. Therefore we will continue to use a consistent integration methodology that includes retaining senior management, avoiding changes to the customer-facing components of each business, and focusing on back of the house synergy capture within procurement, distribution, information technology and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. 
Grow Contract Manufacturing and Other Health and Wellness Beverage Categories in Our Traditional Business with a Focus on the 4Cs 
 The business strategy of our traditional business is to hold volumes broadly stable through growing our sparkling water and mixer category and contract manufacturing channel to offset market declines in private label CSDs and shelf stable juices, and continue to focus on our 4Cs of customers, costs, capex and cash. 
Maintain Customer Focus 
 Customer relationships are important for any business, but at Cott, where many of our products bear our customers brand names, we must maintain particularly close partnerships with our customers. We will continue to provide our customers with high quality products and services at an attractive value that will help them provide quality, value-oriented products to their consumers. We will continue to focus on our high levels of customer service, as well as innovations through the introduction of new packages, flavors and varieties of beverages. We believe our focus on our customers will enable us to leverage our existing relationships and to develop new ones in current and new markets. 
Control Operating Costs 
 We understand that our long-term success will be closely tied to our ability to remain a low-cost supplier. Effective management of our operating costs is critical to our success. As part of our ongoing management of costs, we enter into contract commitments with suppliers of key raw materials such as aluminum sheet metal, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, caps and preforms, fruit and fruit concentrates. On an ongoing basis we review our fixed overhead and manufacturing costs for opportunities for further reductions. In 2011, we transformed the Companys information technology function from a nearly 100% outsourced, single-vendor relationship to a combination of in-house resources and multi-vendor strategy, significantly reducing our total information technology spending. In 2012, we vertically integrated our manufacturing capabilities in order to manufacture our products with increased efficiency and at a lower cost. In 2014, we implemented our three-year $30.0 million Cott North America cost reduction plan, which focused on reducing production costs by improving procurement practices, increasing operational efficiency, eliminating waste and reducing packaging cost, and resulted in over $30 million in cost savings during this time period. In 2015, we launched a multi-year cost and efficiency savings program (2015-2018) within our Cott UK/Europe business unit to better position that business within the competitive landscape. 
Control Capital Expenditures and Rigorously Manage Working Capital 
 Consistent with our status as a low-cost supplier, we leverage our existing manufacturing capacity to maintain an efficient supply chain. We are committed to carefully prioritizing our capital investments that provide the best financial returns for Cott and for our customers, while maintaining safety, efficiency and superior product quality. Our manufacturing facilities operate according to the highest standards of safety and product quality. We perform regular third-party audits of our facilities and are subject to quality audits on behalf of our customers. We will continue to evaluate growth and other opportunities, while remaining mindful of our total capital expenditure targets. As a low-cost supplier, we actively manage our manufacturing capacity and routinely rationalize under-utilized assets. In 2016, our capital expenditures were devoted primarily to supporting growth in health and wellness beverage categories as well as contract manufacturing, maintaining existing facilities, making equipment upgrades and continuing to implement our cost reduction plan. 
Cash Flow Management 
 We believe that a strong financial position will enable us to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace. We therefore continuously review and improve the effectiveness of our cash management processes. We strive to achieve most optimal working capital levels, rationalize our capital expenditures and continuously drive operating cost improvements to enhance cash flow.

Reduce Interest Expense and Debt Leverage While Continuing to Evaluate Acquisition Opportunities 
 Our business strategy also includes reducing our interest costs as well as our debt leverage in the short term which will not only reduce annual interest costs and drive further cash flow growth but will also reduce the overall risk of the business. In the long term, we will continue to focus on evaluating additional mid-to-larger scale opportunities (like the Eden Acquisition and S&D Acquisition) to expand our positions in the HOD water, coffee, tea and filtration services categories, as well as other higher margin or growth-oriented categories where we believe our platform, operating strength and synergies can be leveraged. This is consistent with our ongoing strategy to continue our diversification via value-creative acquisitions outside of CSDs and shelf stable juices, with a focus on other beverage categories and beverage adjacencies, as well as driving our channel mix beyond large format retail and supermarket stores. This strategy could result in taking advantage of opportunities to enter into partnerships with respect to, or dispose of all or part of, our traditional business. 
Restructuring Initiatives 
 We implement restructuring programs from time to time that are designed to improve operating effectiveness and lower costs. When we implement these programs, we incur various charges, including severance and other employment related costs. We did not incur any restructuring charges in 2016 or 2015. 
 During the first quarter of 2014, we implemented one such program, which involved the closure of two of our smaller plants, one located in North America and the other located in the United Kingdom (the 2014 Restructuring Plan). This resulted in 2014 charges of approximately $4.1 million related primarily to employee redundancy costs and relocation of assets, and non-cash charges related to asset impairments and accelerated depreciation on property, plant & equipment. 
 Financial Information about Segments 
 For financial information about reporting segments and geographic areas, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Ingredient and Packaging Supplies 
 In addition to water, the principal raw materials required to produce our products are aluminum cans and ends, resin for PET, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polycarbonate bottles, coffee, tea, caps and preforms, labels, cartons and trays, sweeteners, such as HFCS and sugar, fruit concentrates and fruit. The cost of these raw materials can fluctuate substantially over time. 
 Under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials, the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodity costs, such as aluminum in the case of cans and ends, resin in the case of PET, HDPE and polycarbonate bottles, caps and preforms, corn in the case of HFCS, fruit and fruit concentrates. We believe that we will be able to either renegotiate contracts with these suppliers when they expire or find alternative sources for supply. We also believe there is adequate supply of the ingredient and packaging materials used to produce and package our products. 
 Generally, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of the ingredient and packaging materials used to produce our products, including the underlying costs of the commodities used to manufacture them and, to some extent, the costs of converting those commodities into the materials we purchase. Within our traditional business, our growing contract manufacturing channel generally does not bear the risk of increases in the costs of commodities because the ingredients and packaging are provided by the branded customers that we are servicing. 
 Aluminum for cans and ends, resin for PET, HDPE and polycarbonate bottles, caps and preforms, corn for HFCS, coffee, tea, sugar, fruit and fruit concentrates and fuel are examples of underlying commodities for which we bear the risk of increases in costs. In addition, the contracts for certain of our ingredient and packaging materials permit our suppliers to increase the costs they charge us based on increases in their cost of converting the underlying commodities into the materials we purchase. In certain cases those increases are subject to negotiated limits. Changes in the prices we pay for ingredient and packaging materials occur at times that vary by product and supplier, and take place on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 
 PET resin prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years as the price of oil, one of its components, has fluctuated and demand for synthetic fibers, an alternate use, has increased. Because resin is not a traded commodity, no fixed price mechanism has been implemented, and we expect to pay prevailing market prices for our resin needs, although at times we have been able to enter into short-term fixed price commitments. 
 Corn has a history of volatile price changes. The sugar market is susceptible to volatility as well. 
 
6 
 
Fruit and fruit concentrate prices have been, and we expect them to continue to be, subject to significant volatility. While fruit is available from numerous independent suppliers, these raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to, among other things, changes in crop size and federal and state agricultural programs. 
 A portion of our revenues is derived from coffee product distribution. The supply and price of coffee beans may be affected by weather, international conditions, consumer demand, and access to transportation. An increase in the price of coffee beans could reduce our coffee sales and coffee product margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Trade Secrets, Copyrights, Trademarks and Licenses 
 We sell a majority of our HOD three gallon (3G) and five gallon (5G) bottled water under our own brands while our OCS business sells both our branded products as well as products under which we have a distribution license. We sell a majority of our traditional business beverages as well as our manufactured coffee and tea products under retailer or foodservice brands to customers who own the trademarks associated with those products. We own registrations, or applications to register, various trademarks that are important to our worldwide business, including Cott® and Red Rain® in North America, Stars & Stripes®, Vess®, Vintage®, So Clear® , Harvest Classic®, Chadwick Bay®, Alhambra®, Belmont Springs®, Deep Rock®, Hinckley Springs®, Crystal Springs®, Kentwood Springs®, Mount Olympus® Standard Coffee® and Javarama®, S&D® and S&D Coffee & Tea® in the United States, Canadian Springs® and Labrador® in Canada, Eden®, Eden Springs®, Chateaudeau®, Edelvia®, Eden Selda®, Mey Eden® and Edenissimo® in Europe and Israel, Emerge®, Red Rooster®, MacB®, Carters®, Calypso®, Mr. Freeze®, Jubbly®, Suso®, Cafe Nueva® and Ben Shaws® in the United Kingdom, Stars & Stripes® in Mexico, and RC® mark in various formats in more than 120 countries and territories outside of North America. We are also licensed to use certain trademarks such as Old Jamaica Ginger Beer and Ting in the United Kingdom. The licenses to which we are a party are of varying terms, including some that are perpetual. Trademark ownership is generally of indefinite duration when marks are properly maintained in commercial use. 
Our success depends in part on our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets in the form of concentrate formulas for our beverages and trademarks for the names of the beverages we sell. To protect this intellectual property, we rely principally on registration of trademarks, contractual responsibilities and restrictions in agreements (such as indemnification, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements) with employees, consultants and customers, and on the common law and/or statutory protections afforded to trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We also closely monitor the use of our trademarks and when necessary vigorously pursue any party that infringes on our trademarks, using all available legal remedies. 
 Seasonality of Sales and Working Capital 
 The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. Our beverage and water delivery sales are generally higher during the warmer months, while sales of our coffee products are generally higher during cooler months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations. Our purchases of raw materials and related accounts payable fluctuate based upon the demand for our products as well as the timing of the fruit growing seasons. The seasonality of our sales volume combined with the seasonal nature of fruit growing causes our working capital needs to fluctuate throughout the year, with inventory levels typically increasing in the first half of the year in order to meet high summer demand. In addition, our accounts receivable balances decline in the fall as customers pay their higher-than-average outstanding balances from summer deliveries. 
Customers 
 We experience some customer concentration, primarily in our traditional business. Our traditional business customers include many large national and regional grocery, mass-merchandise, drugstore, wholesale and convenience store chains, as well as customers for whom we manufacture beverages on a contract basis. For 2016, sales to Walmart accounted for 15.7% of our total revenue (201518.0%; 201426.1%), 1.4% of our Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment revenue (20152.2%; 20142.7%), 34.1% of our Cott North America reporting segment revenue (201533.2%; 201433.3%), 10.0% of our Cott U.K. reporting segment revenue (201511.5%; 201412.7%), and 2.8% of our All Other reporting segment revenue (20153.7%; 20143.8%). Walmart was the only customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in those periods. Sales to our top ten customers in 2016, 2015 and 2014 accounted for 29.1%, 32.2% and 46.5%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of revenue in our traditional business for the foreseeable future. The loss of any customers that individually or in the aggregate represent a significant portion of our revenue, or a decline in sales to these customers, would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. 
 
7 
 
We supply Walmart and its affiliated companies, under annual non-exclusive supply agreements, with a variety of products in North America, the United Kingdom, and Mexico, including CSDs, clear, still and sparkling flavored waters, 100% shelf stable juice, juice-based products, bottled water, energy products, sports products, new age beverages and ready-to-drink teas. In 2016, we supplied Walmart with all of its private-label CSDs in the United States. In the event Walmart were to utilize additional suppliers to fulfill a portion of its requirements for CSDs, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
 Research and Development 
 We engage in a variety of research and development activities. These activities principally involve the development of new products, improvement in the quality of existing products, improvement and modernization of production processes, and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $2.4 million in 2016, $2.8 million in 2015 and $2.9 million in 2014 and are included as a component of SG&A expenses. 
Competition 
 Our principal competitor in the 3G and 5G HOD bottled water business in the United States is Nestlé, which competes with us directly in many of our markets. Within Canada and Europe, our principal competitors are local or regional HOD bottled water businesses. We face competition in our HOD business as distribution methods for residential and commercial bottled water products continue to change and evolve, including the increasing availability of 3G and 5G water bottles in retail stores. This could affect our business as some customers may choose to purchase water in returnable bottles through retailers rather than through our sales and distribution network. We have a strategic alliance with Primo Water Corporation (Primo) to bottle and distribute Primos 3G and 5G water bottles through retail stores, however, customers could choose to purchase Primos competitors retail products. Our HOD business also faces increased competition from filtration units in the residential and commercial market. Because homes and offices with installed filtration systems participate at a lower rate in the bottled water market, the installation of these systems poses a competitive threat to our business and reduces the number of potential customers for our bottled water products. In addition, consumers may choose to drink from municipal water sources instead of purchasing bottled water or using a filtration unit. 
 The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience and innovation, and competition could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, wholesale foodservice distributors, regional institutional coffee roasters, and specialty coffee suppliers. If we do not succeed in differentiating ourselves through, among other things, our product and service offerings, then our competitive position may be weakened and our sales and profitability may be materially adversely affected. If, due to competitive pressures or contractual restrictions, we are required to reduce prices to attract market share or we are unable to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases and we are not able to increase sales volumes to offset the margin declines, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 In our traditional business, we compete principally in the non-alcoholic beverages category, which is highly competitive in each region in which we operate. Competition for incremental retail volume is intense. The brands owned by the four major national non-alcoholic beverage companies, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Nestlé Waters North America and Dr. Pepper Snapple (formerly Cadbury Schweppes), control 60.8% of the total CSD and alternative beverage category within the United States. These companies have significant financial resources and spend heavily on promotional programs. They also have direct store delivery systems in North America, which enable their personnel to visit retailers frequently to promote new items, stock shelves and build displays. We also face competition in the juice category from juice brands such as Welchs, Ocean Spray and Motts. In addition, we face competition in North America, the United Kingdom and Mexico from regional beverage manufacturers who sell aggressively priced brands and, in many cases, also supply retailer brand products. A few larger U.S. retailers also self-manufacture products for their own needs and regularly approach other retailers seeking additional business. 
 We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering our customers high-quality products, category management strategies, packaging and marketing strategies, efficient distribution methods, and superior service.

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 
 The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations. 
 A number of states have passed laws setting forth warning or labeling requirements relating to products made for human consumption. For example, the California law known as Proposition 65 requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in California containing a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. This law, and others like it, exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label, although products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. From time to time over the past several years, certain of our customers have received notices alleging that the labeling requirements of the relevant state regulation would apply to products manufactured by us and sold by them. There can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by actions against our customers or us relating to Proposition 65 or similar failure to warn laws. 
 We currently offer and use non-refillable recyclable containers in the United States and other countries around the world. We also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and other countries requiring that deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit, recycling, tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. 
 We are a member of the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) and the Water Quality Association. These associations often set higher water quality standards than those set by governmental agencies. Members must comply with these standards, which are enforced by the members themselves. The IBWA requires submission to annual plant inspections administered by an independent third-party inspection agency, such as the National Sanitation Foundation. These inspections audit quality and testing records, review all areas of plant operations and the bottling process, and check compliance with relevant national standards, good manufacturing practices, and any other regulations set by the IBWA. If we fail to meet the standards set by the IBWA and Water Quality Association, there could be an adverse impact on our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 All of our beverage production facilities and other operations are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which pertain to the use of water resources and the discharge of waste water. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. However, as discussed below, changes in how the Ontario Ministry of the Environment enforces the Ontario Environmental Protection Act could result in our having to make material expenditures for environmental compliance. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, we have coverage for product recalls and product liability claims that could result from the injury, illness or death of consumers using our products, contamination of our products, or damage to or mislabeling of our products. 
 The Ontario Environmental Protection Act (OEPA) 
 OEPA regulations provide that a minimum percentage of a bottlers soft drink sales within specified areas in Ontario must be made in refillable containers. The penalty for non-compliance by a corporation is a fine of C$250,000 per day beginning upon when the first offense occurs and continues until the first conviction, and then increasing to C$500,000 per day for each subsequent conviction. These fines may be increased to equal the amount of monetary benefit acquired by the offender as a result of the commission of the offense.

We, and we believe other industry participants, are currently not in compliance with the requirements of the OEPA. To comply with these requirements we, and we believe many other industry participants, would have to significantly increase sales in refillable containers to a minimum refillable sales ratio of 30%. We do not expect to be in compliance with these regulations in the foreseeable future. Ontario is not enforcing the OEPA at this time, despite the fact that it is still in effect and not amended, but if it chooses to enforce it in the future, we could incur fines for noncompliance and the possible prohibition of sales of soft drinks in non-refillable containers in Ontario. We estimate that approximately 2% of our sales in Canada would be affected by the possible limitation of sales of soft drinks in non-refillable containers in Ontario if the Ontario Ministry of the Environment initiated an action to enforce the provisions of the OEPA against us. Moreover, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment released a report in 1997 stating that these OEPA regulations are outdated and unworkable. However, despite the unworkable nature of the OEPA regulations, they have not yet been revoked. 
 We believe that the magnitude of the potential fines that we could incur if the Ontario Ministry of the Environment chose to enforce these regulations is such that the costs to us of noncompliance could be, although are not contemplated to be, material. However, our management believes that probability of such enforcement is remote. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had over 14,200 employees, of whom approximately 10,050 were in the Water & Coffee Solutions reporting segment, 2,540 were in the Cott North America reporting segment, 1,420 were in the Cott U.K. reporting segment, and 200 were in the All Other reporting segment. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 10% of employees in North America, the United Kingdom and Mexico that contain terms that we believe are typical in the beverage industry. As these agreements expire, we believe that they can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. We consider our relations with employees to be generally good.
