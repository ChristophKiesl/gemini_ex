(1) | OCEAN TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT
----+-----------------------------

​
Ocean Transportation Services:
​
Matson’s Ocean Transportation segment provides the following services:
​
Hawaii Service:  Matson’s Hawaii service provides ocean carriage (lift-on/lift-off, roll-on/roll-off and conventional services) between the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Honolulu, Hawaii. Matson also operates a network of inter-island barges that provide connecting services from its hub at Honolulu to other major Hawaii ports on the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. Matson is the largest carrier of ocean cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii.
​
Westbound cargo carried by Matson to Hawaii includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, building materials, automobiles and household goods. Matson’s eastbound cargo from Hawaii includes automobiles, household goods, dry containers of mixed commodities and livestock. The majority of Matson’s Hawaii service revenue is derived from the westbound carriage of containerized freight.
​
China Service: Matson’s expedited China-Long Beach Express (“CLX”) service is part of an integrated service that carries cargo from Long Beach, California to Honolulu, Hawaii, to Guam, and then to Okinawa, Japan. The vessels continue to Ningbo and Shanghai, China, where they are loaded with cargo to be discharged primarily in Long Beach, California at a Matson-exclusive terminal, operated by SSAT. These vessels also carry cargo destined for Hawaii which originated in Guam, Micronesia, Japan and China. Matson provides container transshipment services from many locations in Asia including Hong Kong and Xiamen, China to the U.S. via the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai, China. 
​
In May 2020, as a result of increased market demand, Matson launched its new China-Long Beach Express Plus (“CLX+”) service. CLX+ vessels operate as a second weekly vessel from China to Long Beach, California, operating back-to-back with the CLX vessels, which together represent Matson’s expedited China service. 
​
Eastbound cargo from China to Long Beach, California consists mainly of garments, e-commerce, consumer electronics, footwear and other merchandise. On our CLX service, westbound cargo to China and other destinations in Asia consists mainly of recycling materials.
​
Guam Service: Matson’s Guam service provides weekly carriage between the U.S West Coast and Guam, as part of its CLX service. Matson also provides weekly connecting service from Guam to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Cargo destined to these markets is similar to that described under “Hawaii Service” above. 
​
Japan Service: Matson’s Japan service provides carriage to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan, as part of its CLX service. This service carries mainly general sustenance cargo and household goods supporting the U.S. military.
​
Micronesia Service: Matson’s Micronesia service provides carriage between the U.S. West Coast and the islands of Kwajalein, Ebeye and Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the islands of Yap, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. Cargo destined for these locations is transshipped through Guam and consists mainly of general sustenance cargo. 
​
Alaska Service: Matson’s Alaska service provides ocean carriage (lift-on/lift-off and conventional services) between the port of Tacoma, Washington, and the ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Matson also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska, and transportation services to other locations in Alaska including the Kenai Peninsula, Fairbanks and the North Slope.
​
Northbound cargo to Alaska consists mainly of dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, household goods and automobiles. Southbound cargo from Alaska primarily consists of seafood, household goods and automobiles.
​

In September 2020, Matson launched its new Alaska-Asia Express (“AAX”) service that provides carriage of dry and frozen seafood from Dutch Harbor, Alaska to Ningbo and Shanghai, China. The AAX service utilizes CLX+ vessels on their westbound trip to China. Matson also provides transshipment services from Ningbo and Shanghai, China to other locations in Asia. Other Alaska cargo may be shipped on the AAX service utilizing Matson’s Alaska vessels and transshipment services in Dutch Harbor.
​
South Pacific Service: Matson’s New Zealand Express (“NZX”) service provides carriage of general sustenance cargo between Auckland, New Zealand and select islands in the South Pacific, including Fiji (Suva and Lautoka), Samoa (Apia), American Samoa (Pago Pago), the Cook Islands (Rarotonga and Aitutaki), Tonga (Nukualofa and Vava’u), and Niue. Matson’s NZX service also provides transshipment services to the islands of Nauru and the Solomon Islands (Honiara). Additionally, Matson provides slot charter arrangements for the transportation of cargo from major ports on the east coast of Australia to ports in the South Pacific islands. The NZX service also distributes and sells domestic bulk fuel to a variety of these islands.
​
Matson’s South Pacific Express (“SPX”) service provides carriage of general sustenance cargo from the U.S. West Coast to ports in the South Pacific islands using vessel sharing agreements with other carriers. The SPX service provides direct calls to Tahiti (Papeete), American Samoa (Pago Pago) and Samoa (Apia) in the South Pacific. Cargo destined for other ports including Tonga (Nukualofa) and the Cook Islands (Rarotonga and Aitutaki) is then transshipped in Apia, Samoa to the NZX service for delivery to its final destination. Northbound SPX cargo originating in the South Pacific is transshipped from the NZX service with other carriers to the U.S. West Coast. Cargo destined for Hawaii or Washington is further transshipped in Oakland, California for delivery to its final destination.

Vessel Emission Regulations: 
​
Being a leader in environmental stewardship is one of Matson’s core values.  Matson’s vessels transit through some of the most environmentally sensitive areas in the United States including the Hawaiian Islands and the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  Matson is focused in particular on reducing transportation emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide through improvements in vessel fuel consumption and the development of more fuel-efficient transportation solutions.  Matson further contributes positively to the environment by testing and deploying leading technologies as the fleet is modernized.  
​
The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), to which the U.S. and over 100 other countries are signatories, is a specialized agency of the United Nations that sets international environmental standards applicable to vessels operating under the flag of any signatory country.  Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO imposed regulations that generally require all vessels to burn fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of ≤0.5 percent (“IMO 2020”).  There are three main options for a vessel to meet the IMO 2020 requirements: (1) burn low sulfur fuel oil (“LSFO”), (2) install exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as “scrubbers”) on vessels to reduce sulfur emissions from high sulfur fuel oil (“HSFO”), or (3) switch to lower emission fuels such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”), which requires converting existing vessels or constructing new vessels with LNG-compatible engines and fuel tanks.  With respect to North America, all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of U.S. and Canadian coastlines have been designated emission control areas (“ECAs”).  Since January 1, 2015, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations have reduced the fuel oil maximum sulfur content in designated ECAs to ≤0.1 percent or the equivalent emissions by the use of scrubbers. In addition, since August 1, 2012, the California Air Resource Board and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Vessel General Permit regulations have reduced the fuel oil maximum sulfur content to ≤0.1 percent within 24 miles of the California coastline and within Puget Sound.  
​
All of Matson’s vessels in the Alaska and Hawaii services are operating in compliance with IMO 2020 and ECA regulations as applicable, and can use LSFO.  In the Alaska and Hawaii services, Matson installed scrubbers on nine diesel-powered vessels to allow them to use HSFO and still comply with IMO 2020 and ECA regulations. Matson also maintains two reserve vessels which may operate as dry-dock relief or for emergency activation purposes under an approved ECA permit enabling the use of fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of ≤0.5 percent within the North America ECA.  Matson’s new Aloha and Kanaloa Class vessels burn compliant LSFO.  These new vessels are also equipped with dual-fuel engines and can be converted to run on LNG.  All of Matson’s other vessels use LSFO to meet IMO 2020 and ECA emission standards.
​
Hawaii Terminal Modernization and Expansion Program:
​
Matson has completed the first phase of modernizing and renovating its terminal facility at Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii, an investment of approximately $60 million. In 2020, Matson completed the installation of three new 65 long-ton capacity gantry cranes, upgraded and renovated three existing cranes, demolished four outdated cranes, and installed upgrades to the electrical infrastructure at the terminal. As part of the second phase, Matson expects to install a new redundant main switchgear, complete the augmentation of its existing backup power generators, install new fuel storage tanks and a battery energy storage system, and perform other upgrades at the terminal. Matson expects to begin the second phase during the second half of 2021 and to complete it within two years. The final phase is expected to begin in 2024 as part of a broader terminal expansion and modernization program at the terminal. 
​
Ocean Transportation Equipment:
​
As a complement to its fleet of vessels, Matson owns a variety of equipment including cranes, terminal equipment, containers and chassis, which represents an investment of approximately $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. Matson also leases containers, chassis and other equipment under various operating lease agreements.
​
Operating Costs:
​
Major components of Matson’s Ocean Transportation operating costs are as follows:
​
Direct Cargo Expense includes terminal handling costs including labor, purchased outside transportation and other related costs. 
​

5




Vessel Operating Expense includes crew wages and related costs; fuel, pilots, tugs and line related costs; vessel charter expenses; and other vessel operating related expenses. Matson purchases fuel oil, lubricants and gasoline for its operations and also pays fuel-related surcharges to other third party transportation providers.
​
Operating Overhead includes equipment repair costs, equipment lease and repositioning expenses, vessel repair and maintenance costs, depreciation and dry-docking amortization, insurance, port engineers and other maintenance costs, and other vessel and shoreside related overhead.
​
Competition:
​
The following is a summary of major competitors in Matson’s Ocean Transportation segment:
​
Hawaii Service: Matson’s Hawaii service has one major U.S. flagged Jones Act competitor, Pasha Hawaii (“Pasha”), which operates container and roll-on/roll-off services between the ports of Long Beach, Oakland and San Diego, California to Hawaii. A U.S. flagged Jones Act barge operator, Aloha Marine Lines, also offers barge service between the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.
​
Foreign-flagged vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from non-U.S. locations also provide alternatives for companies shipping to Hawaii. Other competitors in the Hawaii service include proprietary operators and contract carriers of bulk cargo. Airfreight competition for time-sensitive cargo exists; however, cargo volume has been limited primarily due to the cost of airfreight transportation.
​
Matson operates three strings of vessels to Hawaii. These strings provide customers an industry-leading five departures from ports on the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii every week – two each from Long Beach and Oakland, California and one from Tacoma, Washington. Each of these strings operates on a fixed day-of-the-week schedule. One of the vessel strings continues from Honolulu on to Guam, Japan and China before returning to Long Beach. The remaining two strings offer eastbound Hawaii shippers twice weekly departures from Honolulu to the U.S. Mainland, providing customers service to the same three U.S. West Coast ports. Matson’s frequent sailings and punctuality permit customers to reduce inventory carrying costs. Matson also competes by offering the most comprehensive service to customers, including: the only container service to and from the three largest U.S. West Coast ports; the most efficient terminal network on the U.S. West Coast provided by SSAT; a dedicated inter-island barge network which is integrated with Matson’s line haul schedule; weekly roll-on roll-off service from Long Beach and Oakland; a world-class customer service team; and efficiency and experience in handling cargo of all types.
​
Alaska Service: Matson’s Alaska service has one major U.S. flagged Jones Act competitor, Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc., which operates a roll-on/roll off service between Tacoma, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska. There are also two U.S. flagged Jones Act barge operators, Alaska Marine Lines, which mainly provides services from Seattle, Washington to the ports of Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, and other locations in Alaska, and Samson Tug & Barge, which mainly serves Western Alaska and other locations. The barge operators have historically shipped lower value commodities that can accommodate a longer transit time, as well as construction materials and other cargo that are not conducive to movement in containers. Foreign-flagged vessels provide alternatives for companies shipping cargo (mainly seafood) from the Alaska ports of Kodiak and Dutch Harbor. Matson’s AAX service has two major competitors, CMA CGM and Maersk Lines, which provide services between Dutch Harbor, Alaska and Asia.
​
Matson offers customers twice weekly scheduled service from Tacoma, Washington to Anchorage and Kodiak, Alaska and weekly service to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Company also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska. Matson is the only Jones Act containership operator providing service to Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska, which are the primary loading ports for southbound seafood. Matson offers dedicated terminal services at the Alaska ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor performed by MatNav, and at the port of Tacoma, Washington performed by SSAT.
​
China Service: Major competitors to Matson’s China service include large international carriers such as ONE (formerly “K” Line, NYK Line and MOL), Maersk, CMA CGM, Evergreen, COSCO, and ZIM.
​
Matson’s China service competes by offering fast and reliable service from the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China to Long Beach, California, and providing fixed day arrivals and next-day cargo availability. Matson’s service is further differentiated by SSAT’s best-in-class stevedoring services, access to Shippers Transport Express and off-dock container 

6




yards enabling fast truck turn times, Matson-dedicated equipment including chassis to speed cargo availability, one-stop intermodal connections, and providing world-class customer service. Matson has offices located in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai, and has contracted with terminal operators in Ningbo and Shanghai.
​
Guam Service: Matson’s Guam service has one major competitor, APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged container feeder service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan, via transshipments primarily over Busan, South Korea. Waterman operates a roll-on/roll-off service, which periodically calls at Guam. There are also several foreign carriers, including CMA CGM, that call at Guam from foreign origin ports.
​
Japan Service:  Matson’s Japan service competes primarily with APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged containership service from the U.S. West Coast to the port of Naha, Okinawa, Japan.
​
Micronesia and South Pacific Services: Matson’s Micronesia and South Pacific services have competition from a variety of local and international carriers that provide freight services to the area.
​
Customer Concentration:
​
Matson serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers accounted for approximately 22 percent, 23 percent and 24 percent of the Company’s Ocean Transportation revenue, respectively. None of these customers individually account for more than 10 percent of Matson’s Ocean Transportation operating revenues. For additional information on Ocean Transportation revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.
​
Seasonality:
​
Matson’s Ocean Transportation services typically experience seasonality in volume, generally following a pattern of increasing volumes starting in the second quarter of each year, culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter, with subsequent decline in demand during the fourth and first quarters. This seasonality trend is amplified in the Alaska service primarily due to winter weather and the timing of southbound seafood trade. As a result, earnings tend to follow a similar pattern, offset by periodic vessel dry-docking and other episodic cost factors, which can lead to earnings variability. In addition, in the China trade, volume is typically driven primarily by U.S. consumer demand for goods during key retail selling seasons. Freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply and demand variables.
​
Maritime Laws and the Jones Act:
​
Maritime Laws: All interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. falls under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act).
​
The Jones Act is a long-standing cornerstone of U.S. maritime policy. Under the Jones Act, all vessels transporting cargo between covered U.S. ports must, subject to limited exceptions, be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, be manned predominantly by U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and 75 percent owned by U.S. citizens. U.S. flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign flagged vessels and are subject to rigorous supervision and inspections by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Coast Guard, which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members. Under Section 27 of the Jones Act, the carriage of cargo between the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited.
​
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 62 percent, 72 percent and 72 percent, respectively, of Matson’s Ocean Transportation revenues came from the Hawaii and Alaska trades that were subject to the Jones Act. Matson’s Hawaii and Alaska trade routes are included within the non-contiguous Jones Act market. The commerce of both Hawaii, as an island economy, and Alaska, due to its geographical location, are dependent on ocean transportation. The Jones Act ensures frequent, reliable, roundtrip service to these locations. Matson’s vessels operating in these trade routes are Jones Act qualified.
​
Matson is a member of the American Maritime Partnership (“AMP”) which supports the retention of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. The Jones Act has broad support from both houses of Congress and the Executive Branch.

Matson believes that the ongoing war on terrorism and geopolitical environment have further solidified political support for U.S. flagged vessels because a vital and dedicated U.S. merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense, as well as a critical source of trained U.S. mariners for wartime support. AMP seeks to inform elected officials and the public about the economic, national security, commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. Repeal of the Jones Act would allow foreign-flagged vessel operators that do not have to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations to sail between U.S. ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. domestic operators that must comply with all such laws and regulations.
​
Other U.S. maritime laws require vessels operating between Guam, a U.S. territory, and U.S. ports to be U.S. flagged and predominantly U.S. crewed, but not U.S. built.
​
Cabotage laws are not unique to the United States, and similar laws exist around the world in over 90 countries, including regions in which Matson provides ocean transportation services. Any changes in such laws may have an impact on the services provided by Matson in those regions. For a discussion of the risks arising from the Jones Act and other regulations, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
​
Rate Regulations and Fuel-Related Surcharges:
​
Matson is subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board with respect to its domestic ocean rates. A rate in the non-contiguous domestic trade is presumed reasonable and will not be subject to investigation if the aggregate of increases and decreases is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate in effect one year before the effective date of the proposed rate, subject to increase or decrease by the percentage change in the U.S. Producer Price Index. Matson generally provides a 30-day notice to customers of any increases in general rates and other charges, and passes along decreases as soon as possible.
​
Matson’s Ocean Transportation services engaged in U.S.-foreign commerce are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”). The FMC is a federal independent regulatory agency that is responsible for the regulation of international ocean-borne transportation to and from the U.S. 
​
Matson applies a fuel-related surcharge rate to its Ocean Transportation customers. Changes in the fuel-related surcharge levels are correlated to market rates for bunker fuel prices along with other factors related to fuel expense recovery. 
​
Other Environmental Regulations:
​
In addition to the vessel emission regulations discussed above, Matson’s operations are required to comply with other environmental regulations and requirements including the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act. Matson is also subject to state regulations affecting terminal and vessel emissions, such as the requirement to shut down vessel auxiliary engines while at berth at California ports and switch to electrical power. The Company actively monitors its operations to address compliance with these and other regulations.

----+------------------

​
Logistics Services:
​
Matson Logistics provides the following services:

Transportation Brokerage Services:  Matson Logistics provides intermodal rail, highway, and other third-party logistics services for North American customers and international ocean carrier customers, including MatNav.  Matson Logistics strives to reduce transportation costs for its customers through volume purchases of rail, motor carrier and ocean

transportation services, augmented by services such as shipment tracking and tracing, and single-vendor invoicing. Matson Logistics operates customer service centers and has sales offices throughout North America.

Freight Forwarding Services: Matson Logistics provides LCL consolidation and freight forwarding services primarily to the Alaska market through its wholly owned subsidiary, Span Intermediate, LLC (“Span Alaska”). Span Alaska’s business aggregates LCL freight at its cross-dock facility in Auburn, Washington for consolidation and shipment to its service center in Anchorage and a network of other facilities in Alaska. Span Alaska also provides trucking services to its Auburn cross-dock facility and from its Alaska based cross-dock facilities to final customer destinations in Alaska.

Warehousing and Distribution Services:  Matson Logistics operates two warehouses in Georgia and two warehouses in Northern California providing warehousing, value-added packaging and distribution services.
​
Supply Chain Management and Other Services:  Matson Logistics provides customers with a variety of logistics services including purchase order management, customs brokerage, LCL and full container load NVOCC freight forwarding services. Matson Logistics has supply chain operations in North America, China and other locations.
​
Operating Costs:
​
Matson Logistics’ operating costs primarily consist of the costs of purchased transportation, leases of warehouses, cross-dock and other facility operating costs, salaries and benefits, and other operating overhead. 
​
Competition:
​
Matson Logistics competes with hundreds of local, regional, national and international companies that provide transportation and third-party logistics services. The industry is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition varies by geography and areas of service. 
​
Matson Logistics’ transportation brokerage services compete most directly with C.H. Robinson Worldwide, the Hub Group, XPO and other freight brokers and intermodal marketing companies, and asset-invested market leaders such as J.B. Hunt. Competition is differentiated by the depth, scale and scope of customer relationships; vendor relationships and rates; network capacity; real-time visibility into the movement of customers’ goods; and other technology solutions. Additionally, while Matson Logistics primarily provides surface transportation brokerage, it also competes to a lesser degree with other forms of transportation for the movement of cargo.
​
Matson Logistics’ freight forwarding services compete most directly with a variety of freight forwarding companies that operate within Alaska including Carlile, Lynden, American Fast Freight and Alaska Traffic Company.
​
Customer Concentration:
​
Matson Logistics serves customers in numerous industries and geographical locations. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s 10 largest logistics customers accounted for approximately 19 percent, 21 percent and 23 percent of Matson Logistics’ revenue, respectively. None of these customers individually accounts for more than 10 percent of Matson Logistics’ operating revenues. For additional information on Logistics revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.
​
Seasonality:
​
In general, Matson Logistics’ services are not significantly impacted by seasonality factors, with the exception of its freight forwarding service to Alaska which may be affected by winter weather and the seasonal nature of the tourism industry.
​

C. | EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS
---+------------------------------

​
Human Capital Strategy:
​
In support of Matson’s vision to be a great place to work for all employees, the Company focuses on a variety of human capital programs that have been developed to attract, retain and motivate its employee workforce. As a company that 

9




operates in various global locations, the Company’s human capital programs are designed to reflect the unique market practices in each geographic location. The Company’s success depends on employing a diverse, talented and engaged workforce that reflects its local communities, supports an environment of high standards and performance, and thrives in the Company’s collaborative and respectful culture. 
​
During 2020, Matson had 4,149 employees worldwide, of which 128 employees were based in international locations and 2,953 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. These numbers include seagoing personnel who rotate through billets (as described below) and temporary employees, but do not include employees of SSAT or other non-employee affiliates such as agents and contractors. In prior years, Matson reported the number of regular shoreside employees only and excluded seagoing personnel and temporary employees. The composition of Matson’s workforce by geography is as follows:
​
​
Matson’s fleet of active vessels requires 317 billets to operate. Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore. These amounts exclude billets related to Matson’s foreign flagged chartered vessels where the vessel owner is responsible for its seagoing personnel. Matson’s vessel management services also employed personnel in 32 billets to manage three U.S. government vessels.
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion:
​
For many years, Matson has been committed to improving diversity, providing equal pay for equal work and creating an inclusive culture. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, traditionally the shipping industry's workforce has been predominately represented by white males. While Matson’s workforce is representative of many of the communities where it operates, the Company believes it can do more to change the status quo within the Company and industry. 
​
The composition of Matson’s domestic shoreside workforce by gender and race in 2020 is as follows (data for seagoing personnel is not available to the Company):
​
​
The composition of management positions within Matson’s domestic shoreside workforce by gender and race in 2020 is as follows (data for seagoing personnel is not available to the Company):
​
​
In 2020, the Company continued to advance many of its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. This includes continuing its efforts to analyze pay among various employee groups to confirm pay equity across the Company. Externally, the Company is supporting programs intended to help build a diverse talent pool for Matson and its industry. In 2020, the Company committed $100,000 toward creation of new Matson scholarships to be offered in conjunction with 

10




approximately 15 higher education institutions and maritime academies in its communities with the goal of increasing diversity among those pursuing studies in transportation and logistics. Separately, the Company has committed more than $200,000 to expand its paid internship program with the goal of increasing exposure to the Company and industry among a diverse group of students in its various regional locations. 
​
Total Rewards Programs:
​
Matson provides a highly competitive and balanced total rewards program designed to attract, retain and motivate its employees. While factors such as job, location and business unit ultimately determine which plans an employee may be eligible for participation, the Company’s total rewards offering includes market competitive base salaries, cash and equity incentives, recognition awards, health and welfare benefits, and employee and employer funded retirement plans. The Company believes that management level positions should have a portion of pay aligned with its short- and long-term business objectives. Accordingly, the Company’s total rewards program contains several pay-for-performance components tied to individual, business unit and company performance, as well as Matson stock price performance.
​
Succession and Career Planning:
​
Matson’s workforce is characterized by uniquely skilled, long-tenured employees. To create career pathways for future leaders while planning for the loss of retiring employees, the Company takes a proactive approach to succession and career planning. The Company focuses on providing the next generation of promising talent with the tools they need to build their own careers at Matson. In 2019 and 2020, 40 percent and 53 percent of open positions, respectively, were filled through internal promotions. The Company also provided more than 2,250 hours of employee training and development, while giving regular performance reviews to its non-union workforce.

​
Bargaining Agreements:
​
Matson’s shoreside and seagoing employees are represented by a variety of unions. As shown in the chart below, union employees comprise 71% of Matson’s global workforce.
​
​
Matson has collective bargaining agreements with these unions that expire at various dates in the future. While Matson believes that it will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements with its various unions as they expire without any significant impact on its operations, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be reached without slow-downs, strikes, lockouts or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson’s operations. For a discussion of the risks arising from the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
​
Additionally, Matson and SSAT are members of the Pacific Maritime Association (“PMA”), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (“ILWU”) on the U.S. West Coast. The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor. In August 2017, the ILWU agreed to extend its contract with the PMA to July 1, 2022. 
​
Multi-employer Pension and Post-retirement Plans:
​
Matson contributes to a number of multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans. Matson has no present intention of withdrawing from, and does not anticipate the termination of any of the multi-employer pension plans to which it contributes (see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below for a discussion of withdrawal liabilities under certain multi-employer pension plans).
