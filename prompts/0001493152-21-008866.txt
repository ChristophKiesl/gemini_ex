Pursuant to the AR Citrine Agreement, TechCare agreed to sell Citrine S A L Group and its group of business partners, up to an aggregate of 893,699,276 shares of TechCare’s common stock, representing approximately 95% of TechCare’s fully diluted capital, in two tranches, with the initial tranche of up to 452,063,196 shares of the TechCare’s common stock to be sold conditioned upon (i) the resignation of the Company’s existing members of its board of directors (the “Board”), consisting of Oren Traistman and Yossef De-Levy, (ii) the appointment of each of Ora Elharar Soffer (formerly Ora Meir Soffer), Ilan Ben Ishay and Ilanit Halperin as members of the Board, and (iii) the transfer of the TechCare’s signatory rights to all Company bank accounts in the name of Citrine S A L Group’s nominee. In addition, the AR Citrine S A L Group Agreement provides for the second tranche of up to the remaining number of shares of common stock that will result in Citrine S A L Group, owning 95% of the TechCare’s fully diluted capital stock, to be sold conditioned upon the filing of the Company’s previously approved amendment to its First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the Company’s authorized capital.
 
On January 6, 2020, definitive agreements were executed for the sale of 90% of the shares in Novomic Ltd.

On May 31, 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Intelicanna Ltd., an Israeli medical cannabis company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange with ticker symbol INTL (“Intelicanna”), via a share exchange agreement and an agreement for future issuance of shares. The share exchange agreement provides that (i) the number of shares each party issues to the other will be calculated by dividing $500 thousand by the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the issuing party’s shares in the three trading days preceding the signing of the agreement, (ii) the issuance by Intelicanna will take place upon, and subject to, receipt of approval from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and the issuance by the Company will follow immediately thereafter, and (iii) the parties may not sell the shares within the first six months after issuance, and thereafter the parties may sell the shares issued to them if the shares become registered through a prospectus approved by the relevant securities authority, or under an exemption provided by applicable securities law, subject to a limit on the number of shares either party may sell per day. The agreement for future issuance of shares provides that a fall in a share price of a party, not exceeding 20%, measured six months after issuance of shares by both parties pursuant to the share exchange agreement, will be offset by the issuance of additional shares to the other party to bring up to $500 thousand the total value of the shares issued to the other party.
 
Furthermore, on June 25, 2020, Citrine Global Israel has entered into a services agreement with Intelicanna to provide business development and consulting services to Intelicanna, including assistance with raising financing (the “Services Agreement”) (references in this paragraph to the Company include the Israeli Subsidiary). The terms of the Services Agreement include: (1) the Company will, for a period of 18 months, assist Intelicanna to raise up to NIS 15 million for Intelicanna’s working capital purposes, whether through issuance of convertible securities or any other means; all sums raised must be approved in advance by the Company, and in accordance with a business plan presented to the Company from time to time; the Company will have no obligation under the Services Agreement to invest in Intelicanna, and no liability if its efforts to source financing for Intelicanna are unsuccessful; (2) in the event Intelicanna raises funds through assistance from the Company, the Company will be entitled to (i) cash consideration equal to 5% of any amount raised, whether directly from the Company, or from any of its affiliates or any unrelated third party, and (ii) options to acquire a number of shares of Intelicanna equal to 5% of the amount raised divided by the Exercise Price; the “Exercise Price” will be the price per share at which the amount was raised, or if it was not raised through issuance of shares, the price per share at which Intelicanna last raised funds through issuance of shares; and (3) for one or more periods of at least 90 days, each time at Intelicanna’s request which the Company may accept or decline at its discretion, the Company will provide business development and strategy-building services, including: consulting on strategy and business plan; assistance defining financing needs; helping identify ways to develop potential sources of finance; and ongoing consulting support to Intelicanna’s management team and board. Intelicanna will pay the Company a fee of NIS 2,500 per day for such services.
 
Also on June 25, 2020, to assist Intelicanna to raise the first NIS 1 million, the Company and the Israeli Subsidiary entered into an agreement to grant Intelicanna NIS 1 million in cash (approximately USD 290 thousand) in direct financing for working capital purposes. The financing will bear 6% annual interest and Intelicanna will make additional payments equalling 6% of its gross revenues between the date the financing is received and the date Intelicanna’s aggregate gross revenues thereafter equal NIS 2 million. If the total of the 6% interest plus the additional payments would result in a return of less than 12% in the year to the Company, the interest will be increased to bring the total return to 12%. Every three months Intelicanna must pay the interest, and after 12 months, it must repay the capital, plus the total of the additional payments due, plus any outstanding interest, and it must pay interest of 2% per month on any late payments, provided however that until the foregoing obligations are paid in full Intelicanna must pay 50% of its gross revenues to the Company upon receipt. If Intelicanna does not pay all amounts due within 18 months, it shall, at the Company’s option, issue to the Company a number of its shares equal to NIS 1.5 million divided by the lower of (i) the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the three trading days prior to the lapse of the 18 months, and (ii) VWAP of the three trading days prior to the signing of the financing agreement. The financing must be paid by the Company to Intelicanna within 30 days of signing the financing agreement, subject to completion of due diligence to the Company’s satisfaction and to Intelicanna receiving a commercial growing license.
 
On July 9, 2020, we transferred to Intelicanna NIS 500 thousand (approximately $145 thousand) on account of the above loan. On March 31, 2021, Intelicanna repaid the loan with the 12% interest.

Israel has an advantage in the Life Sciences industry with growth in the number of companies developing technologies for the health and medical cannabis industries. There are currently hundreds of companies researching medical pharma-grade cannabinoid drugs for treating diseases, such as cancer, epilepsy, autism, as well as companies developing solutions for using big data and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, digital health solutions, food tech engineering, and supplements, agritech, and more.
 
Experts involved in Israel’s booming cannabis industry estimate that Israel has the potential to be a global cannabis hub thanks to a critical mass of scientists and clinicians familiar with and open to medical uses of cannabis, strong biotech industry, and researchers in leading medical institutes and universities and a positive government approach to the medical cannabis industry. The world’s major companies have already begun to express interest in Israeli research in this field.

The awareness of health and wellness is growing, with an emphasis on preventive medicine and wellbeing solutions and the use of botanicals, food supplements and edibles, and cosmetics infused with CBD and hemp (non-addictive cannabis components), which are beneficial for a variety of health problems, is expanding. In addition, changing consumer behavior and disruptive technologies are enabling the rapid consumerization and personalization of healthcare. There is an evolution from prescription drugs, doctor-administered diagnostics, and medical treatments to a new marketplace centered around people’s well-being as individuals, not patients, enabling and improving ‘quality of life’ in ways that can be seamlessly integrated into their daily routines.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention and budgets to developing solutions to answer market needs for treatment, prevention, and everyday life solutions in this new situation. The fields of health and wellness have been the focus of global attention and even more so since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
For these reasons, we decided to focus on health and wellness and particularly on the growing industries of botanicals, medical cannabis, and CBD/hemp industries, and we intend to do so in accordance with current rules and regulations applicable in every country.
 
Botanicals Industry Overview and Potential
 
The global botanical ingredients market size was estimated at $131.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.0% from 2020 to 2027 and reach $225 billion in 2027. The global botanical ingredients market growth is driven by growing awareness towards health and safety in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries. Authentic consumption has become a significant food and beverage trend, and people seek non-artificial and natural ingredients. Products such as ginseng, echinacea, Ginkgo Biloba, and garlic are considered as the major selling botanical products and are considered natural remedies for inflammation and infections.
 
The growth of the market for botanical ingredients is further driven by the ongoing pandemic COVID-19. People looking for strengthening the natural immune system also with vitamins and minerals and moving towards natural colorant-based plant juice products since they provide better and long-lasting protection from virus and bacteria. In addition, botanicals are widely used by people who suffer from diseases related to weight management, clinical nutrition, digestive health (gut health problems), immunity, diabetes, and cardio fitness, either as treatment or prevention.
 
The cosmetic and personal care segment is also on the rise with companies constantly discovering novel herbal ingredients as people are inclining more towards natural ingredients-based products.
 
The main applications of botanicals are in the following market segments: Food & Beverages, Dietary Supplements, Cosmetic & Personal Care, and Pharmaceuticals.
 
Biotech/Healthcare Industry Overview and Potential – Specific Areas
 
BIOTECH:
 
The global Biotechnology Market is expected to reach USD 833.34 Billion by 2027 and includes areas such as Nano-biotechnology, DNA Sequencing, Fermentation, PCR Technology, Cell-based Assay, Chromatography, Tissue engineering and Regeneration, and others. The solutions are applied in Agriculture, Industrial Processing, Pharmacy, Bioinformatics, Environment, Bio services and more.
DIGITAL HEALTH:
 
The emergence and growth of healthcare IT and remote patient monitoring services, coupled with the increasing penetration of smart devices and mobile platforms, apart from favorable government policies, has spurred the growth of this market and it is attracting a lot of investments. Market size would touch $379 billion by 2024, growing at an astounding CAGR of more than 25.9%.

BIG DATA FOR THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY
 
The global big data analytics in the healthcare market is predicted to reach $148.34 billion by 2028, up from $22.43 billion in 2019. Amid the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic, 166 healthcare AI startups globally raised over $2.1 billion in the first half of 2020.
 
Healthcare and specifically the biopharma industry face significant challenges such as high R&D costs, harsh regulatory compliance demands, increase in the cost needed to bring products to market, the threat of patent expirations, and more. A significant change is needed to the current pharma R&D model to increase productivity and profitability. The technology that can bring forward this change is big data analysis based on artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”), which can introduce greater efficiency, productivity, economy, and quality.
 
Most big pharma companies (such as Novartis, Roche, Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson, etc.) are already starting to take advantage of AI innovation.
 
Big Data-based AI/ML technologies can be implemented in all stages of drug development, from early discovery to commercialization, as they are involved in collecting and using very large datasets.
 
Healthcare big data is too vast and complex to be available and meaningful by traditional means. The development of AI algorithms, incorporating ML and deep learning, has enabled the automatic and efficient collection, management, and analysis of big biomedical data in all its forms, including medical records, DNA and RNA sequencing, and medical images. Health maintenance organizations, health insurers and pharmaceutical companies are all looking for tools based on artificial intelligence and big data, in order to gain a significant advantage over their competitors in the market by improving their products, services, and results. Artificial intelligence systems are beginning to be assimilated as tools in clinical and research environments. Today, only 4% of the clinical and biological data is being utilized.
 
Medical Cannabis and CBD Industry Overview and Potential
 
Global trends explaining exponential growth of cannabis market and recent emergence of pharma-level certified cannabis drugs:
 
The Impact of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global economy. Countries seeking to recover financially in the aftermath of the pandemic will seek new sources of taxable revenue, which medical and adult-use cannabis could offer. CBD consumption increased because many consumers with increased awareness of their health sought to treat COVID-19 induced anxieties.
 
The Impact of The New US administration. The US presidential election in November 2020 was a momentous event for the cannabis industry not only did all cannabis legalization ballots pass in all five states (Mississippi, South Dakota, New Jersey, Arizona, and Montana), but also democratic leaders Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris were elected into the White House. Both the president and vice president-elect have indicated an interest in tackling federal cannabis reform in the country during their term in office. We have taken a conservative approach regarding the US. We decided that since the legal landscape for medical cannabis is not finalized and varies from state to state, we will not operate in the US in the cannabis industry. We plan to establish innovation centers in the US in industries such as health, wellness, botanicals, food-tech, and other areas that we are exploring with local partners.
 
EU Trade implications. Following the European Court of Justice verdict on CBD, we’ve already seen the European Commission take action to realign its position on the substance. This has resulted in the EU recommencing the frozen CBD Novel Food marketing authorization applications.
 
The Global Medical Cannabis Export Arms Race. The race to supply the growing demand of the European medical cannabis market is on. Once dominated by Canadian and Dutch exports, in the past year or so, we have seen Portugal become a major supplier and smaller export successes from the likes of Spain, Australia, and Israel.

Pharma Approved CBD. The European dronabinol industry (a drug approved by the FDA as safe and effective for HIV/AIDS-induced anorexia and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting) attracts major players in global cannabis as Breath of Life Pharma, Cantourage, Tilray, and Echo Pharmaceuticals. In the same year, the UK’s Food Standards Agency classified CBD as a novel food granting UK CBD companies a head start compared to their European competitors. Despite the considerable uncertainties which will arise from the new trade relations with Europe; the UK also has an opportunity to develop their line on the regulation of cannabis and CBD. Latin American cannabis and hemp markets are going to be in the spotlight in 2021. While Brazil is expecting Congress to vote on law PL399 in early 2021, which, if approved, would represent a new major cultivation player, Mexico voted for the law and potentially is to become the largest adult-use market this decade.
 
MEDCIAL CANNABIS:
 
Medical cannabis solutions have been approved for medical use in many countries. They have been shown to benefit more than 40 serious medical conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson, epilepsy, chronic pain, post-trauma, Chronic digestive problems, Crohn’s Disease, anxiety and sleep disorders, Concentration and memory problems, Tourette Syndrome, and more.
 
The global legal cannabis market is forecast to be worth up to $103.9 billion by the year 2024, driven, in the most part, by the burgeoning international medicinal cannabis market, worth a potential $62.7 billion by the same year.
 
Propelled onwards by the increasing number of countries considering cannabis reform and the penetration of cannabis products into new consumer product markets, the first-of-its-kind global report expects the worldwide cannabis market to reach new heights by 2024.
 
PHARMA GRADE CANNABIS DRUGS
 
Earlier this year, Jazz Pharmaceuticals purchased GW Pharmaceuticals in a $7.2 billion cash-and-stock deal. The target of the deal was to promote its neuroscience business by adding cannabis-based epilepsy treatment in 2020 third-quarter sales, contributing a sizeable chunk to the overall sales of about $600 million. The acquisition will allow Jazz to expand its offerings beyond sleep disorders and cancer by adding GW Pharma’s Epidiolex. The cannabis-based drug was approved in the United States in June 2018.
CANNABIS CAPITAL MARKET
 
S&P Global reported that U.S. and Canadian cannabis and cannabis-related companies completed 124 deals in 2020, worth a combined $615.1 million. In the past few months, some big deals have taken place in the cannabis industry. In December 2020, news of a near-$4 billion merger, including Canadian cannabis giants Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), will create the largest cannabis company in the world in terms of revenue. In February 2021, Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) also announced it would be acquiring GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH). and with more states in the U.S. legalizing cannabis and slightly more friendly U.S.presidential administration, there is currently a lot of excitement in the industry.

Revenues
 
We plan on generating revenues from technology acquisitions and collaborations, professional and business consulting fees, brokering fees, leasing, and management services for real-estate assets we own, taking advantage of favorable market conditions to sell real-estate assets, company value appreciation, interest income, investments, and more.
Competition
 
The technological innovation and business strategy consulting landscape is very crowded and competitive. Many models for promoting innovation exist worldwide, from technology incubators and accelerators to joint ventures between industries, governments, and universities, to REITs and more. Our business model is unique in two aspects: (i) it provides a complete solution covering various fields, from research, development, to production, operations, strategy, and business consulting, and (ii) most solutions for promoting innovation address the initial stages of seed companies and startups. Our solutions cover these stages as well but are primarily focused on growth-stage industries and global expansion needs relating to sales and operations.
 
Among the competition, we can list other more established consulting firms, investment bankers, brokers, real-estate funds, investment firms, online lending sites, tech incubators, and more. Our business competes primarily in Israel, Europe, and North America. We mainly target clients with whom we have existing relationships, either directly or via our partners. We believe that our shareholders, directors, and officers’ experience and contacts and the fact that we offer a wide range of services under one roof will contribute to our competitiveness. Specifically relating to Cannovation Center in Israel, the medical cannabis industry is, and is expected to remain, very competitive.
 
The medical cannabis competition is primarily on a regional basis and could vary significantly pending on location and time, as regulations constantly change. The medical cannabis market is in a high growth phase. We are working to achieve a prominent position by taking advantage of the Israeli medical cannabis recognition and technological lead and our years of experience in the field.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
We need to obtain various regulatory approvals and licenses for the medical cannabis activities, botanicals, clinical and preclinical trials, real-estate assets we acquire and other businesses that require certain approvals and licenses for the premises in which they operate (such as laboratories).
 
According to current Israeli law regarding medical cannabis, IMC-GMP-certified manufacturers can sell to pharmacies or export. 
 
The various components of the medical cannabis supply chain in Israel are currently obliged to meet Good Practices Procedures for Israel Medical Cannabis (‘‘IMC’’) as set forth by the Israeli Ministry of Health’s Medical Cannabis Unit (‘‘MCU’’). These standards are based on international standards and guarantee the high quality of Israeli medical cannabis products.
