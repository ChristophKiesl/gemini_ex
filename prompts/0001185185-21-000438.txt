ITEM 1.         BUSINESS
 
We are workers’ compensation cost containment specialists providing a range of services principally to California employers and claims administrators.  The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Utah in April 1970, under the name Clear Air, Inc.  The Company changed its name to Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc., in January 2001.  In February 2001, the Company acquired Medex in a share for share exchange.  Medex is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Medex is in the business of managing and administering both Health Care Organizations (“HCOs”) and Managed Provider Networks (“MPNs”) in the state of California.  In August 2001, we formed IRC, a California corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary of PHCO.  IRC oversees and manages the Company’s Workers’ Compensation carve-outs services. In June 2010, the Company acquired MLS, a Nevada corporation incorporated in September 2009, as a wholly owned subsidiary.  MLS offers lien representation services and Medicare set-aside (“MSA”) services.  In February 2012, we incorporated MMM in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. MMM is responsible for overseeing and managing medical case management services. In March 2011, we incorporated MMC in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  MMC oversees and manages the Company’s utilization review and managed bill review services.  In October 2018, we incorporated PMHC in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary, to act as a holding company for potential future acquisitions. In order to simplify business procedures, bookkeeping and administrative structure; and eliminate duplicative functions and reduce costs; we plan to terminate the existence of IRC, MLS and PMHC and wind up those subsidiaries during 2021.  The business, assets and liabilities of those entities will be transferred to PHCO or its other subsidiaries.
 

Business of the Company
 
We offer an integrated and layered array of complimentary business solutions that enable our customers to better manage their employee workers’ compensation-related healthcare administration costs. We are constantly looking for ways to expand the suite of services we can provide our customers, either through strategic acquisitions or organic development.
 
Our business objective is to deliver value to our customers that reduces their workers’ compensation-related medical claims expense in a manner that will assure that injured employees receive high quality healthcare that allows them to recover from injury and return to gainful employment without undue delay.  According to studies conducted by auditing bodies on behalf of the California Division of Workers’ Compensation, (“DWC”) the two most significant cost drivers for workers’ compensation are claims frequency and medical treatment costs.  Our services focus on containing medical treatment costs.
 
Our services include two HCOs, MPNs, medical case management, utilization review, medical bill review, workers’ compensation carve-outs and Medicare set-aside services. We also provide lien representation and expert witness testimony, ancillary to our other services. We offer our services as a bundled solution, as standalone services, or as add-on services.
 
Our customers include self-administered employers, insurers, third party administrators, municipalities and others. Our principal customers are companies with operations located in the state of California where the high cost of workers’ compensation insurance is a critical problem for employers, though we have processed medical bill reviews in 17 states. Our provider networks, which are located only in California, are composed of providers experienced in treating worker injuries.

Our core services focus on reducing medical treatment costs by enabling our customers to share control over the medical treatment process.  This control is primarily obtained by participation in one of our medical treatment networks.  We hold several valuable government-issued licenses to operate medical treatment networks.  Through Medex we hold two of the total of seven licenses issued by the state of California to establish and manage HCOs within the state of California. We also hold approvals issued by the state of California to act as an MPN. Our HCO and MPN programs provide our customers with provider networks within which the customer has some ability to direct the administration of the claim.  This is designed to decrease the incidence of fraudulent claims and disability awards and ensure injured employees receive the necessary back-to-work rehabilitation and training they need.  We also offer medical bill and utilization review that provide oversight of medical billing and treatment requests, along with medical case management, which keeps medical treatment claims progressing to a resolution and assures treatment plans are aligned from a medical perspective.
 
Health Care Organizations
 
An HCO is a network of health care professionals specializing in the treatment of workplace injuries and in back-to-work rehabilitation and training of our customers’ employees. HCOs were created to appeal to injured workers, while providing substantial savings to the customers. In most cases, our HCOs give the customer up to 180 days of medical control in a provider network within which the customer can direct the administration of the claim. The injured worker may change physicians once during this period, but the worker may not leave the provider network. The increased length of time during which the customer has control over administration of the claim is designed to decrease the incidence of fraudulent claims and disability awards. The right for the customer to control treatment within a network is also based upon the notion that if the customer has input on medical treatment there will be more control over getting injured workers healthy and back on the job. One intended outcome of the HCO program is by the customer retaining input on treatment, the customer is better able to control total claim treatment costs and related workers’ compensation insurance premiums.
 
Our two HCO licenses allow us to cover the entire state of California. Our HCO networks (respectively referred to as “Medex HCO” and “Medex2 HCO”) are required to be recertified every three years. The Medex HCO network is scheduled for recertification in March 2022 and the Medex2 HCO network is scheduled for recertification in October 2021.  Our customers can offer their injured workers a choice of enrolling in an HCO with a network managed by primary care providers which requires primary care physicians to make referrals to needed specialists or in an HCO where injured workers do not need any prior authorization to be seen and treated by specialists.
 
Our HCO networks, Medex HCO and Medex2 HCO, have contracted with approximately 5,000 and 6,000, respectively, individual medical providers and clinics, as well as hospitals, pharmacies, rehabilitation centers and other ancillary service providers.  These relationships enable our HCOs to provide comprehensive medical services throughout California.  Our HCO networks are composed of medical providers experienced in treating worker injuries.  We are continually reviewing and enhancing these networks with provider additions and removals based on feedback from our customers, their claim’s administrators and from our internal processes. All network provider credentials are reviewed and approved by Medex.
 
HCO guidelines impose certain medical oversight, reporting, information delivery and usage fees upon HCOs. These requirements increase the administrative costs and obligations on HCOs compared to MPNs, although the obligations and cost differentials between the two types of organizations have been narrowing over the past few years.
 
Medical Provider Networks
 
Like an HCO, an MPN is a network of health care professionals, but health care professionals participating in MPNs are not required to have the same level of medical expertise in treating workplace injuries.  Under an MPN program the customer dictates which physician the injured employee will see for the initial visit.  Thereafter, the employee has discretion to choose which physician in the network will continue treatment of the claim; employees, however, are limited to treatment by health care professionals within the MPN for the life of the claim, which is a benefit to our customers.  While the injured employee is limited to treatment by health care professionals within the MPN for the life of the claim, the California MPN laws and regulations allow the injured employee to dispute treatment decisions, provide for second and third medical opinions, and then permit case review by an independent medical reviewer whose decision can result in the customer losing control over medical treatment of the employee.
 
Unlike our HCOs, our MPNs do not require our customers to pay annual enrollment fees, nor do they require our customers to comply with annual enrollment notice delivery requirements.  As a result, there are fewer administrative costs to customers associated with an MPN program.  This allows our MPNs to market their services at a lower cost to employers than our HCOs.  For this reason, many customers may opt to use the less complicated MPN even though it provides customers fewer rights to control medical treatment of employee injury claims.

We have received approval for and currently administer 30 MPNs. Each MPN must be reapproved every four years.
 
HCO and MPN
 
As a licensed HCO and approved MPN, in addition to offering HCO and MPN programs, we are also able to offer our customers a combination of the HCO and MPN programs.  Under this plan model a customer can enroll its employees in our HCO program, and then prior to the expiration of the 180-day treatment period under the HCO program, the customer can enroll its employee into our MPN program.  This allows our customers to take advantage of both programs, which is what our HCO customers typically do.  To our knowledge, Medex is currently the only entity in California offering this hybrid program.
Medical Case Management
 
Medical case management keeps medical treatment claims progressing to a resolution and assures treatment plans are aligned from a medical perspective. Medical oversight is a collaborative process that assesses, evaluates, coordinates, implements and monitors medical treatment plans and the options and services required to meet an injured worker’s health needs. Medical case managers act as liaisons between the injured worker, claims adjuster, medical providers and attorneys to achieve optimal results for injured workers and customers.
 
Our medical case management services are performed by nurses who are credentialed by the state and have expertise in various clinical areas and backgrounds in workers’ compensation matters.  This combination allows our nurses the opportunity to facilitate medical treatment while understanding the nuances of workers’ compensation up to and including litigation.  By utilizing these services our customers help assure that the injured worker receives quality medical treatment in a timely and appropriate manner to return the employee to work.
 
Workers’ Compensation Carve-outs
 
Certain employers can opt out of the standard workers’ compensation regulatory dispute resolution scheme through carve-out agreements that comply with state statutory and regulatory requirements. More specifically, carve-out agreements permit employers and employees to establish alternative dispute resolution arrangements to resolve disputes in the context of workers’ compensation. These carve-out agreements are made between employers and the collective bargaining units representing the employer’s covered employees.
 
Utilizing our knowledge of the friction in the California workers’ compensation system, and the objectives of employers and the unions, we assist in guiding the negotiation of legal agreements for the implementation of workers’ compensation carve-outs for California customers and provide services that reflect the parties’ agreement with regard to alternative dispute resolution arrangements. Under such carve-out agreements certain customers can access our HCOs, MPNs and medical case management program.
 
Utilization Review
 
Utilization review is designed to evaluate the medical necessity of proposed treatment by comparing medical treatment requests against accepted medical guidelines. Its purpose is to serve as a safeguard against payor liability for medical costs that are not medically appropriate or approved by the relevant medical and legal authorities. Reviews of medical treatment requests are conducted at the appropriate qualification level for the request by either a nurse, peer-to-peer provider, by a specialist or by a medical director and within the timelines set by the relevant laws and regulations.
Medical Bill Review
 
Many states have adopted fee schedules, which regulate the maximum allowable fees payable under workers’ compensation for procedures performed by a variety of health treatment providers. However, many procedures are not covered by fee schedules and are still subject to review and negotiation. We provide professional analysis of medical provider services and equipment billing to ascertain proper reimbursement.  Such services include, but are not limited to, coding review and re-bundling, confirming that the services are customary and reasonable, fee schedule compliance, out-of-network bill review, pharmacy review, and preferred provider organization repricing arrangements.  These services can result in significant network savings. We currently process medical bill review in 17 states. Out of state medical bill reviews typically are the result of an injured California employee moving to a different state, but who still requires medical care.

Lien Representation
 
When a worker is injured in the scope of employment the employer is required to provide workers’ compensation benefits, including medical treatment. If the medical treatment is not paid because the services were not authorized, or if the provider disputes the amount of reimbursement, the provider may file a lien against the workers’ compensation claim, which must be resolved by the employer. In these cases, we provide our customers lien representation services that include negotiation through litigation and petitions for reconsideration.
Expert Witness Services
 
As an ancillary service to our HCO and MPN services, we provide expert witness testimony before the California Workers Compensation Appeals Board.  The fees we charge for this service include reimbursement of witness fees and travel and lodging expenses.
Medicare Set-aside
 
We provide Medicare set-aside services for workers’ compensation claims which is a financial agreement that allocates a portion of a workers’ compensation settlement to pay for future medical services related to the work-place injury, illness, or disease. The purpose of the set-aside arrangement is to provide funds to the injured party to pay for future medical expenses that would not be covered by Medicare. This program affords our customers an effective way to overcome complications after settlement and avoids unnecessary costs attached to the claim.
Marketing, Customers and Pricing
 
We provide services to virtually any size employer in the state of California as well as insurers, third party administrators, self-administered employers, municipalities and other industries.  We also provide some customers utilization review and/or utilization management, medical case management, and medical bill review services outside the state of California, typically to employees who have suffered a workplace injury in California and then relocated to another state.
 
Our marketing and sales efforts focus primarily on customer referrals, conference presentations, responding to requests for proposals, and advertisement.  We service both local and national accounts, however, with an emphasis on California focused markets.  Our sales and marketing activities are conducted by account managers with the assistance of our executive team members. We do not market our services outside the state of California.
 
During 2020, three major customers accounted for 42% of sales, approximately 20%, 12% and 10%, respectively. By comparison, during 2019 our three largest customers accounted for 50% of sales, approximately 26%, 14% and 10%, respectively.
 
Our services can be integrated to allow for partial or full bundling of services and sharing of information that create efficiencies to further reduce the costs of claims.  For example, our bundled services have allowed some customers to achieve up to a 70% reduction in the cost of injury claim resolution while maintaining superior treatment for their injured workers. The cost to our customers for our bundled services is generally the same as if the services were purchased individually.
 
Competition
 
We were one of the first commercial enterprises capable of offering HCO services and MPN services in California.  Now there are many companies who compete in this market.  Many of these competitors are larger than PHCO and may have greater financial, research and marketing experience and resources than we do, and they may therefore represent substantial long-term competition.  As of December 31, 2020, in California there were seven certified health care organization licenses issued to five companies. We own two of the seven licenses and have four possible direct HCO competitors.  Only three of these HCO competitors, however, are currently writing HCO business due to the complexity of the HCO regulations.  There are minimal requirements for establishing MPNs and therefore, as of December 31, 2020, there were 2,457 active MPNs in the state of California according to the DWC MPN website.  Of these, we have received approval for and administer 30 MPNs. We previously administered more than 90 MPNs, but favorable regulatory changes allowed us to consolidate many of them, leading to fewer administrative oversight requirements.

We compete on both quality-of-service delivery and price of services.  We maintain quality of service by virtue of the training, skill, and experience of our professional staff and outside consultants. We compete on price through our integration of robust information technology systems we license from various vendors.  We focus our business primarily on those employers and payors who use our HCO and/or MPN services.  We anticipate that this focus will keep most of this business stable and renewable.  However, periodically we expect that some large customer may establish the in-house capability of performing the services we offer, as this has occurred in the past.  Further, if we are unable to compete effectively either because of a degradation in quality-of-service delivery resulting from a reduction in the skill and experience of our personnel, or our inability to effectively manage our information technology system, it may be difficult for us to retain current customers or add new customers.  With the resulting loss of customers, from whatever source, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
We rely on our well-trained and knowledgeable in-house professionals to develop service offerings that target the needs of our customers, all of whom seek efficient and effective resolution of workplace injuries and workers’ compensation claims. For example, we contract directly with medical providers based on quality determinations rather than the provision of discounted medical services. We believe this provides us a competitive advantage because we can market a direct relationship with providers who have demonstrated expertise in treating work related injuries and writing credible medical reports.  These qualities contribute to quicker resolution of workplace injuries and workers’ compensation claims.  We believe these qualities also provide more competitive value than relying on third party relationships or discounts alone.
 
We offer both HCO and MPN programs to potential customers, as well as an HCO/MPN combination model, which we believe also gives us a competitive advantage, because of the way the network was created.  While some of our competitors offer either HCO or MPN services, to our knowledge, none of our competitors offer this type of HCO/MPN combination model, nor, in our opinion, do they have the expertise to administer one.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Managed care programs for workers’ compensation are subject to various laws and regulations.  The nature and degree of applicable regulation varies by state and by the specific services provided.  Notably, services such as our HCOs, MPNs, and utilization review services that provide or arrange for the provision of healthcare services are subject to numerous complex regulatory requirements that govern many aspects of our conduct and operations.  These laws and regulations impose evolving administrative and legal burdens, expense and risk to our business, but also provide a regulated environment in which our expertise and experience help us provide valuable services for our customers based on proven strategies that work within the existing system.
 
Managed healthcare is a rapidly changing and expanding industry and the cost of providing healthcare continues to increase.  We believe these factors increase the likelihood that federal and state regulatory frameworks applicable to managed healthcare will expand to have a greater impact upon the conduct and operation of our business.
 
The provision of workers’ compensation managed care in the state of California is governed by legislation and secondary regulations.  We are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval to operate our networks and be accredited by the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (“URAC”) in California to perform utilization review. MMC has received full Utilization Management Accreditation for Workers’ Compensation as a Utilization Review Organization (“URO”) from the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, now known as URAC. The full accreditation demonstrates our commitment to quality and adherence to nationally recognized guidelines and must be reaccredited every three years.  Our next reaccreditation is scheduled to occur by January 1, 2024. The costs to be accredited by URAC for three years is $36,000. California and other jurisdictions in which we do business require individuals who engage in claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities to be personally licensed.  In many jurisdictions, licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities.
 
The services we provide have developed largely in response to legislation or other governmental action.  Changes in the legislation regulating workers’ compensation may create greater or lesser demand for the services we offer or require us to develop new or modified services to meet the needs of the marketplace and compete effectively, such changes could also impact our costs for providing services, perhaps to levels that make our services unattractive or unaffordable to existing or potential customers.  We could also be materially and adversely affected if the state of California were to elect to reduce the extent of medical cost containment strategies available to insurance companies and other payors or adopt other strategies for cost containment that would not support demand for our services. In order to obviate such possibilities as much as possible, we have engaged a California-based lobbyist with expertise in workers’ compensation.  When there is proposed legislation in California that might affect our business, we are notified at the discussion stage and are often included as stakeholders for preliminary discussions.

Healthcare reform remains a topic of considerable discussion at both the federal and state level.  Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of future reform initiatives and the timing of their enactment, we cannot predict which, if any, reforms will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on our business or within the industry in which we participate.  However, because workers’ compensation is primarily a disability program, not the focus of recent healthcare reform discussion, we do not believe any such healthcare reform would significantly impact workers’ compensation.
 
Employees
 
Including the employees of our subsidiaries, as of March 22, 2021, we had 34 total employees, all of which are full-time employees.  We also use the services of several consultants.  Over the next twelve months, we anticipate hiring additional employees only if business revenues increase and our operating requirements warrant such hiring.
