ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
The following discussion relates to the business that the Company has historically and currently operates. As a result of a transaction the Company entered into with its Founder, as defined, on September 21, 2016, the Company has been seeking to acquire another business in a reverse merger transaction that would be dilutive to the Company’s existing shareholders, which would likely occur together with the financing which would be further dilutive to existing shareholder. Although, the Founder continues to operate our business and advancing personal funds to do so, he has been unable to monetize that business. It is for this reason that he concluded that he would never recoup the approximately $1,956,000 he had previously lent to the Company and agreed to bring in a new chief executive officer who was charged with finding an acquisition. During the course of the periods since September 21, 2016, the new Chief Executive Officer has devoted time toward finding such a reverse merger candidate. While he has located such an opportunity, no binding agreements have been reached and we cannot assure you that any definitive agreement will be reached in the future and thereafter closed. Consequently, the Company’s operations are subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including failing to secure additional funding to carry out the Company’s business plan.
 
Truli serves as a collaborative digital platform for members of the faith and family community worldwide, allowing them to share and deepen their faith and family values together. Truli invites ministries from various religious denominations to upload their messages to the Truli platform, at no cost. Our goal is to have an ever expanding library from these participating ministries, centralizing, serving and extending the Christian and family values message to a greater audience than previously done before. This platform delivers all types of media content to Internet accessible devices such as computers and an assortment of digital mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones. Currently, there are roughly 14,000 videos in its library, with faith-based content currently representing roughly 50% of the Truli platform with roughly 50% of the platform representing family entertainment such as feature films “G” and “PG” rated, music videos, children’s programming, sports, education, blogs, etc. Truli also currently streams 8 Christian Network Television channels on its website. The Truli platform is also available in the Spanish language on its platform which includes roughly 4,500 items in its library.
 
History
 
Truli Media Group, Inc., was incorporated in Oklahoma on July 28, 2008. On June 13, 2012, the Company acquired Truli Media Group, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company (“Truli LLC”) formed on October 19, 2011. Under the terms of the Reorganization Agreement, all of Truli LLC’s membership interests were exchanged for shares of the Truli Media Group, Inc. common stock, or, at the time, approximately 74% of the fully diluted issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Truli Media Group, Inc. Prior to this reverse merger, the company was a publicly traded corporation with nominal operations. On March 17, 2015, Truli reincorporated in Delaware.
 
On September 21, 2016, Michael J. Solomon, the founder of Truli LLC and Chairman of the Board of the Company (the “Founder”) sold convertible notes with a principal amount of $1,955,934 previously issued by the Company to the Founder (the “Convertible Notes”) to two institutional investors in equal amounts in exchange for payment of $102,500 from each investor. Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (the “NPA”) it will be an Event of Default if the Founder does not pay all operating costs of the Company (other than specified public company costs and the Convertible Notes). Additionally, the Founder has a one year option to acquire the Company’s current operating assets for $5,000. The NPA requires the Founder to pay all of the liabilities as of the date of the NPA other than the Convertible Notes and public company expenses and continue to pay all operating liabilities other than the public company liabilities, which will be paid by the purchasers of the Convertible Notes for one year. If the Founder fails to pay these liabilities, it will be an Event of Default under the Convertible Notes.
 
Concurrent with the sale of the Convertible Notes to the two institutional investors, the Founder and an affiliate sold their controlling block of Company Common Stock to the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer for $6,000. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in order to simplify accounting and the potential exercise of the option to acquire the Company’s current operating assets, the Company formed TMC as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and thereafter the Company transferred its operating assets to TMC and the Founder assumed the operating liabilities other than the Convertible Notes and public company liabilities. In describing the business of the Company below, the description relates to its historical business since October 2011 as operated by Truli LLC through October 2016 and thereafter by TMC. All references to TMC in this context give effect to the operations by Truli prior to the date of the transfer of the assets to TMC.
 
Business Strategy
 
Truli’s goal is to sign up as many ministries as possible throughout the United States and abroad. Truli is affiliated with over two hundred fifty ministries and churches, and allows them to deliver their content through the Truli platform. We hope to attract ministries to join our platform by potentially providing benefits to them including (i) expanded dissemination of their message regardless of size, budget or location, (ii) direct user feedback from our consumers, and (iii) organization of their sermons and content as well as general technological advances to augment traditional places of worship.
 
Truli consumers have access to free content as well as certain Pay-per-View content on the interactive digital platform from which we hope to eventually derive revenue. In the event we are able to raise sufficient capital, and our platform gains significant traffic, we plan to sell advertising space on our website. We additionally plan to sell faith based merchandise through our website once we are financially able to do so. We also have created a “donation” section of our website whereby we will receive 15% of donations given to ministries and churches. Truli also will allow partners to monetize their content through our platform by letting them set purchase prices for their content, and allowing them to receive money though the “donation” section of our website.

Competition
 
We face significant competition from integrated online media companies, social networking sites, traditional print and broadcast media, search engines, and various e-commerce sites. Our competitors include many well-known and fully funded news and information websites and content providers. Several of our competitors offer an integrated variety of Internet products, advertising services, technologies, online services and/or content that may compete for the attention of our users, advertisers, developers, and publishers. We may also in the future, more directly compete with these companies to obtain agreements with third parties to promote or distribute our services. In addition, we compete with social media and networking sites which are attracting an increasing share of users, users’ online time and online advertising dollars.
Employees
 
As of June 26, 2017, we have one full-time employee who works for TMC.
 
Marketing
 
Due to our current lack of capital, we currently market in a very limited capacity, primarily through press releases. In the event that we are able to access capital in the future, we would create a marketing campaign including, (i) direct marketing to ministries outlining the benefits of our platform to their ministry, (ii) presence at trade shows and conferences including the National Religious Broadcasters Convention which networks thousands of Christian community members and business people and the international Christian Retailers Show which is the largest Christian retailer gathering in the world, and (iii) other types of marketing including but not limited to social media, press exposure, brand building at various seminars, viral and social strategies as well as the utilization of networks, bloggers, newsletters, direct calling and radio. If we are able to raise sufficient capital we also plan on developing technology to create mobile phone applications related to our content. It is not likely that we will raise capital until Mr. Solomon either exercises his option and we acquire a new operating entity or the option lapses and we continue to own TMC. In that event, Mr. Solomon will likely become Chief Executive Officer again.
Plan of Operation
 
Because Mr. Solomon began to see that the public markets did not appear to favor TMC’s business, he sold the Convertible Notes and acquired the option to acquire TMC. We have had discussions with third parties about acquiring another business. Any acquisition would likely require us to raise capital using common stock or securities convertible into exercisable for and/or exchangeable for common stock. We cannot assure you Mr. Solomon will exercise his option or that we will enter into a reverse merger transaction and complete a financing. If we do, terms may be adverse to our current shareholders.
