The Company seeks to intimately understand its customers and inspire them through rich brand experiences wherever, whenever and however they choose to shop. The Company engages with its customers through in-store interactions, social media platforms, mobile applications, loyalty programs, online surveys and customer reviews, and is continuously receiving and responding to customer feedback. Our Abercrombie and Hollister customer relationship management programs provide a platform to develop direct relationships with our customers. Our brands have a strong base of globally diverse followers on key social media platforms. The Company also engages with key influencers such as celebrities, bloggers and stylists to share its product and communicate its brand identity. The Company endeavors to be at the forefront of exploring new ways in which our customers may want to engage with our brands. This allows us to better understand who our customers are, what they value and aspire to, how they shop and behave and what they expect from our brands.

OMNICHANNEL AND DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER OPERATIONS.
As our customers increasingly shop across multiple channels, the Company has developed, and continues to expand, its robust omnichannel capabilities. These capabilities now include “ship-from-store,” “order-in-store,” “reserve-in-store” and “purchase-online-pickup-in-store.” The Company continues to invest in these and other omnichannel initiatives in order to create a more seamless shopping experience for its customers.
The Company operates 30 desktop and mobile websites for its brands globally. The websites are available in 11 languages, accept 29 currencies and ship to more than 120 countries. Total net sales through direct-to-consumer operations, including shipping and handling revenue, were $856.8 million for Fiscal 2016, representing approximately 26% of total net sales.
WHOLESALE, FRANCHISE AND LICENSING OPERATIONS . 
The Company continues to expand its brand reach through various wholesale, franchise and licensing arrangements. Total net sales from wholesale, franchise and licensing operations were $36.1 million for Fiscal 2016, representing approximately 1% of total net sales. As of January 28, 2017, the Company's franchisees operated four international franchise stores, all of which are located in Mexico.
MERCHANDISE SUPPLIERS.
Meeting the Company's objective of delivering compelling, on-trend, high-quality product assortments to its customers is dependent upon its network of third-party vendors. During Fiscal 2016, the Company sourced merchandise through approximately 150 vendors located throughout the world, primarily in Asia and Central America. The Company did not source more than 10% of its merchandise from any single factory or supplier during Fiscal 2016. The Company pursues a global sourcing strategy that includes relationships with vendors in 17 countries, as well as the U.S. The Company’s foreign sourcing of merchandise is negotiated and settled in U.S. Dollars.
All product sources, including independent manufacturers and suppliers, must achieve and maintain the Company’s high quality standards, which are an integral part of the Company’s identity. The Company has established supplier product quality standards to ensure the high quality of fabrics and other materials used in the Company’s products. The Company utilizes both home office and field employees to help monitor compliance with the Company’s supplier product quality standards.
Before the Company begins production, factories, including subcontractors of the factories, must go through a quality assurance assessment to ensure they meet Company standards. All factories are contractually required to adhere to the Company's Vendor Code of Conduct, and go through social audits, which include on-site walk-throughs to appraise the physical working conditions and health and safety practices, and to review payroll and age documentation. Social audits of the factories are performed at least every two years after the initial audit. The Company partners with suppliers that respect local laws and share our dedication to utilizing best practices in human rights, labor rights, environmental practices and workplace safety.
DISTRIBUTION AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORY.
The Company's distribution network is built to deliver stock to its stores and fulfill direct-to-consumer orders with speed and efficiency. The Company’s merchandise is shipped to the Company’s distribution centers (“DCs”) where it is received and inspected before being shipped to stores or direct-to-consumer customers. The Company has two Company-owned DCs located in New Albany, Ohio, one of which is a dedicated direct-to-consumer facility, and one third-party DC located in Reno, Nevada that service our North American stores and direct-to-consumer customers outside of Europe and Asia. The Company uses a third-party DC in the Netherlands for the distribution of merchandise to stores and direct-to-consumer customers located in Europe, a third-party DC in China for the distribution of merchandise to stores and direct-to-consumer customers located in China, a third-party DC in Hong Kong for the distribution of merchandise to stores and direct-to-consumer customers located in Asia, and a third-party DC in the United Arab Emirates for the distribution of merchandise to stores located in the Middle East. The Company utilizes primarily one contract carrier to ship merchandise and related materials to its North American stores and direct-to-consumer customers, and several contract carriers for its European and Asian stores and direct-to-consumer customers.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
The Company’s management information systems consist of a full range of retail, merchandising and financial systems. The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, direct-to-consumer, inventory management, supply chain, planning, sourcing, merchandising and financial reporting. The Company continues to invest in technology to upgrade core systems to enhance efficiencies, including the support of its direct-to-consumer operations, omnichannel capabilities, customer relationship management tools and loyalty programs.
SEASONAL BUSINESS.
The retail apparel market has two principal selling seasons: the Spring season which includes the first and second fiscal quarters (“Spring”); and the Fall season which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters (“Fall”). As is typical in the apparel industry, the Company experiences its greatest sales activity during the Fall season due to Back-to-School (August) and Holiday (November and December) sales periods.

Our competitors include individual and chain specialty apparel retailers, local, regional, national and international department stores, discount stores and online businesses. Additionally, there is competition for consumer discretionary spending from other product and experiential categories, such as technology, restaurants, travel and media content. 
Consumers are increasingly shopping online and via mobile devices, which enable consumers to quickly and conveniently comparison shop for product availability and by price. 
We compete primarily on the basis of brand experience, customer service, product selection, quality, store location and price.
