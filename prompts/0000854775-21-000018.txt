ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Background and Product Offerings
Digi International Inc. ("Digi," "we," "our," or "us") was incorporated in 1985 as a Minnesota corporation. We were reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1989 in conjunction with our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol DGII. Our World Headquarters is located at 9350 Excelsior Blvd., Suite 700, Hopkins, Minnesota 55343. The telephone number at our World Headquarters is (952) 912-3444. 
We are a leading global provider of business and mission-critical Internet of Things ("IoT") connectivity products, services and solutions. We help our customers deploy, monitor and manage critical communications infrastructures that deliver important information in demanding environments with high levels of security and reliability. We have two reportable operating segments under applicable accounting standards: (i) IoT Products & Services; and (ii) IoT Solutions. 
Our IoT Products & Services segment offers products and services that help original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), enterprise and government customers create and deploy, secure IoT connectivity solutions. From embedded and wireless modules to console servers as well as enterprise and industrial routers, we provide a wide variety of communication sub-assemblies and finished products to meet our customers' IoT communication requirements. In addition, this segment provides our customers with a device management platform and other professional services to enable customers to capture and manage data from devices connected to networks. 
Our IoT Solutions segment primarily consists of our SmartSense by Digi® business. SmartSense offers wireless temperature and other condition-based monitoring services as well as employee task management services. These solutions are focused on the following vertical markets: food service, healthcare (primarily pharmacies and hospitals) and supply chain. We initially formed, expanded and enhanced our SmartSense by Digi business through four acquisitions. 
Following the conclusion of our fiscal 2021, we acquired Ventus Holdings in November 2021. Ventus makes us a leader in the provision of Managed Network-as-a-Service ("MNaaS") solutions that simplify the complexity of enterprise wide area network ("WAN") connectivity for our customers. Ventus’s portfolio includes cellular wireless and fixed line WAN solutions for an array of connectivity applications in banking, healthcare, retail, gaming, hospitality and other sectors. We are analyzing the business segment placement of Ventus's business. At present, we expect it will be included in our IoT Solutions segment, but a final determination is still pending.
For more in-depth descriptions of our products and services, please refer to the heading "Principal Products and Services" at the end of Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
Our corporate website address is www.digi.com. In the "Company - Investor Relations" section of our website, we make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, our proxy statement and any amendments to these reports available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
Ongoing Impacts of COVID-19
The ongoing pandemic continues to create significant uncertainty regarding the nearer term outlook for our operations and the markets where we provide products and services. While the rollout of vaccines is well underway in many parts of the world, the pandemic (including the recent spread of more contagious variants of the virus) and related economic volatility it has caused still represents a fluid situation that presents a wide and changing range of potential impacts on our own business and those of our customers, vendors and other business partners. 
We continue to take a range of actions to assure we comply with government restrictions and guidelines as well as strong practices to protect the health and well-being of our employees and our ability to continue operating our business effectively. To date, we have been able to operate our business effectively using these measures and to maintain all internal controls as documented and posted. For example, we have successfully operated in a remote environment to prioritize employee safety without adversely impacting our day-to-day operations. We also have not experienced challenges in maintaining the continuity of our day-to-day business operations and do not expect to incur material expenditures to do so. We continue to monitor travel restrictions, and border closures closely so we are positioned to mitigate the negative impacts of any future restrictions or closures. We also continue to monitor government restrictions, mask mandates, and vaccine mandates in the locations where 
we have operations. Since the start of the pandemic there have not been any material changes to our assets on our balance sheet and, at present, we do not expect there to be material adverse changes. During fiscal 2021, we reviewed the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on goodwill and intangible assets and determined there to be no material impact at that time . We also reviewed the potential impacts on future risks to the business as it relates to collections, returns and other business related items. No significant changes to these reserves have been made.
Supply Chain Disruptions
Like many companies, we are experiencing disruptions in our supply chain for a variety of reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic, container ship backlogs, energy shortages in certain parts of the world, and components and material shortages. This has led to shortfalls in available components we need to make products as well as increased costs both to obtain components and to transport components and products. It has also lengthened the timelines for us to fulfill customer orders. The severity of the disruptions is changing continuously, meaning the impact on our ability to meet demand for particular products in a timely manner has been subject to ebb and flow. In some instances, these disruptions have been material and it is possible more material disruptions will occur. We are taking steps to attempt to mitigate the impact of the disruptions such as placing inventory demand further out into the future to secure our allocations of components, negotiating and engaging with suppliers to reserve components, encouraging customers to place orders earlier than normal due to longer lead times and attempting (in conjunction with customers) to influence political leaders to assure components needed to make products that are essential to the health and well-being of society are prioritized to our customer’s needs by suppliers. Some of our suppliers are also experiencing supply chain disruptions which in turn has, and may continue to, disrupt our operations. At present the ongoing duration and severity of these disruptions is not known. As such, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these disruptions on our business and financial results, which could be material.
Industry and Marketplace Conditions
We believe the IoT industry is in the midst of a multi-year expansion as many industries are undergoing a digital transformation within their business that drives demand for IoT capabilities across a broad spectrum of services. Among others, IoT use cases include automating workflows, condition-based monitoring and asset tracking.
Our IoT Products & Services segment represented the significant majority of our sales in fiscal 2021. This segment sells both wired and wireless products that are either embedded into the products of OEMs or as stand-alone products. These offerings allow our customers to connect a wide range of assets to networks. This segment grew during fiscal 2021, led by increases in our embedded and console servers revenues. The segment includes some products that are in the mature phase of their life cycle and have been experiencing sales declines for several years. We manage this segment with more focus on profitability and more modest revenue growth expectations relative to our IoT Solutions segment. 
Our IoT Solutions segment grew significantly in fiscal 2021 primarily because of increased demand for our SmartSense by Digi offerings. In large part, the increased demand arose because for much of fiscal 2020 some customers in our target markets for these offerings paused new or expanded operating initiatives due to significant uncertainty caused by the onset of the ongoing pandemic. During fiscal 2021 we added approximately 11,000 new sites that use our SmartSense monitoring services and now monitor in excess of 80,000 locations. Ventus presently serves over 170,000 sites. We manage this segment with more focus on revenue growth with more modest profitability growth relative to our IoT Product & Services segment. 
On November 2, 2021 we announced our acquisition of Ventus Holdings. This acquisition makes us a market leader in the provision of MNaaS solutions that simplify the complexity of enterprise WAN connectivity for an array of connectivity applications in banking, healthcare, retail, gaming, hospitality and other sectors. Ventus presently serves over 170,000 sites. We are in the process of confirming the segment reporting for this business, but presently expect it will be included in our IoT Solutions segment.
While we expect an ongoing long-term trend of marketplace growth, each of our business segments is susceptible to downturns either because of general macro-economic conditions, the continued development of technology that can make products less competitive or even obsolete and uncertainty or changes in regulatory environments. Given the current uncertainty in macro-economic conditions initiated by the ongoing pandemic, including, but not limited to, ongoing supply chain disruptions globally and the uncertain status of large project-based customer deployment opportunities, our results during fiscal 2022 may be inconsistent.
Strategy
We remain focused on taking steps that we believe will deliver consistent, long-term growth with higher levels of profitability. Over the last six years, acquisitions have helped significantly advance our strategy for growth and profitability, in both business segments. Over time we expect to continue to be active in making further acquisitions. 
IoT Products & Services Segment
Our IoT Products & Services segment is being managed so our product management and sales personnel are aligned along specific product lines to bring greater market focus and potential growth to the product lines. We also continue to drive efforts to pair our hardware offerings with our Digi Remote Manager® device management platform as well as other support services. These bundled offerings allow customers to monitor and manage the performance of our hardware remotely. During fiscal 2021 we made two acquisitions in this segment designated to improve our market position and enhance our path to recurring revenue. 
On March 26, 2021, we acquired Haxiot, Inc. ("Haxiot"), a Dallas-based provider of low power wide area ("LPWA") wireless technology. This acquisition enhanced our IoT Products & Services segment by enhancing Digi's embedded systems portfolio and immediately extending the company's market reach with a complete LoRaWAN®-based solutions offering.
On July 6, 2021, we acquired Ctek, Inc. ("Ctek"), a San Pedro, California-based provider that specializes in solutions for remote monitoring and industrial controls. Through the acquisition of Ctek, Digi is uniquely positioned to provide customers with both battery and hardwired options for the control and monitoring of critical infrastructure, from complex off-shore oil rig locations to localized deployments such as municipal park lighting. In addition, Ctek’s offering and existing client portfolio is set to further Digi’s reach in a rapidly expanding market.
IoT Solutions Segment
Our IoT Solutions segment is being managed primarily for revenue growth. This segment was formed through four acquisitions. Since the last acquisition in October 2017, it has grown through sales growth. While this segment still represents a modest overall portion of total revenues, we have high organic growth expectations and we will continue to explore added scale through acquisitions.
SmartSense by Digi helps customers monitor temperature and other conditions important to preserve the quality of perishable or other sensitive inventories and tracks the completion of employee tasks. Our efforts have created a market-leading, high-growth hardware enabled service business with a significant recurring revenue base. At present, this marketplace primarily is served by smaller companies that lack the infrastructure to provide hardware-enabled implementation services to customers in as effective and efficient a manner as we are able to do because of our long-standing history as an IoT hardware provider. 
As of September 30, 2021, SmartSense by Digi served nearly 81,000 customer sites for many leading brands in the following vertical markets: food service, healthcare (primarily pharmacies) and supply chain. We entered these markets aggressively as they share similar needs for continuous monitoring and asset tracking for compliance and regulatory purposes. We believe these markets comprise a large addressable market with low customer penetration. 
Recent Acquisition of Ventus Holdings
On November 2, 2021 we announced our acquisition of Ventus Holdings. This acquisition makes a us a leader MNaaS solutions that simplify the complexity of enterprise WAN connectivity for an array of applications in banking, healthcare, retail, gaming, hospitality and other sectors. Ventus presently provides services to over 170,000 sites. We are in the process of confirming the segment reporting for this business, but presently expect it will be included in our IoT Solutions segment.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
Acquisitions
In addition to our fiscal 2021 acquisitions of Haxiot and Ctek and our recent acquisition of Ventus disclosed above, we have made the following acquisitions from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2020.
We completed the following four acquisitions that served as the basis for our SmartSense by Digi business and our IoT Solutions Segment:
In October 2015, we acquired Ontario-based Bluenica Corporation ("Bluenica"). Bluenica focused on temperature monitoring of perishable goods in the food industry by using wireless sensors to ensure that quality, freshness and public health requirements are met.
In November 2016, we acquired Pittsburgh-based FreshTemp, LLC ("FreshTemp®"). FreshTemp® offered restaurants, convenience stores and other retailers the ability to monitor the temperature of food products automatically through the use of wireless sensors. The company also enabled these businesses to track the completion of operational tasks by their employees that could impact human health and safety in real time.
In January 2017, we acquired Indiana-based SMART Temps,LLC (" SMART Temps®"). SMART Temps® provided real-time temperature management for restaurant, grocery, education and healthcare settings. The acquisition significantly expanded our customer base, especially in the pharmacy and education marketplaces.
In October 2017, we acquired Boston-based TempAlert, LLC ("TempAlert"), a provider of automated, real-time temperature monitoring and task management solutions for the healthcare, industrial and food service industries. This acquisition more than doubled the number of customer sites we monitored while enhancing our ability to analyze data collected from our services.
We also completed the following two acquisitions that augmented product offerings in our IoT Products & Services segment:
In January 2018, we acquired Tampa-based Accelerated Concepts, Inc. ("Accelerated"), a provider of secure, enterprise-grade, cellular (LTE) networking equipment and backup connectivity applications. This acquisition expanded our IoT Products & Services segment by enhancing our existing cellular product lines and extended our market reach with a line of commercial routers and network appliance products. 
In December 2019, we acquired New Jersey-based Opengear, Inc. ("Opengear"), a provider of secure IT infrastructure products and software. This acquisition provides products that are complementary to our IoT Products & Services segment.
Sales Channels
A significant portion of our IoT Products & Services segment sales are made through a global network of distributors, systems integrators and value added resellers ("VARs"). These third parties accounted for 47.0%, 37.5% and 46.1% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our IoT Solutions segment historically has not sold through these channels. We also complete sales of both IoT Products & Services and IoT Solutions through our own dedicated sales organization to OEMs, large enterprise customers and other end user customers which accounted for 53.0%, 62.5% and 53.9% of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Distributors
Our larger distributors, by sales volume, include Arrow Electronics, Avnet, Bressner Technology GmbH, Digi-Key, Express Systems & Peripherals, Ingram Micro, Mouser Electronics, Solid State Supplies, Symmetry Electronics, Synnex, Tech Data, Tokyo Electron Device and Venco Electrónica S.A. We also maintain relationships with many other distributors both domestically and internationally.
Strategic Sales Relationships 
We maintain alliances with other industry leaders to develop and market technology solutions. These include many major communications hardware and software vendors, operating system suppliers, computer hardware manufacturers, enterprise application providers and cellular carriers. Among others, relationships include: AT&T, NXP, Orange, Rogers, Silicon Laboratories, T-Mobile, Telus, Telit, T-Mobile, Verizon, Vodafone and several other cellular carriers worldwide. 
We have established relationships with equipment vendors in a range of industries such as energy, industrial, retail, transportation, medical, and government that allow these partners to ship our products and services as component parts of their overall solutions. Our products are used by many of the world’s leading telecommunications companies and Internet service providers, including AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon.
No single customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for any of the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Competition
We compete primarily in the communications technology industry. This industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards. This market can be affected significantly by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants. It is possible new market entrants could market and sell disruptive technologies that impact one or more of our product or service offerings. In addition, we may compete with other companies to acquire new businesses or technologies and the competition to secure such assets may be intense. We compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features, service and software application capabilities, company reputation, brand recognition, technical support, alliance relationships, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price and availability. While no competitor offers a comparable range of products and services, various companies do compete with us with respect to one or more of our products or solutions. With respect to many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who dedicate more resources and attention to that particular offering than we are able to do given the breadth of our business. As the marketplace for IoT connectivity products and solutions continues to grow, we expect to encounter increased competition. Some of these competitors may have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess.
Manufacturing Operations
We outsource our manufacturing operations to certain contract manufacturers, which are located primarily in Thailand, China, Mexico and Taiwan. We rely on third party foundries or companies who rely on third party foundries for our semiconductor devices that are Application Specific Integrated Circuits ("ASICs"). We also outsource printed circuit board production. By outsourcing our operations to these manufacturers, we can leverage the manufacturing strength of our vendors, which allows us to focus on new product introductions. In addition, it allows us to reduce our fixed costs, maintain production flexibility and optimize our profits. 
Our products are manufactured to our designs with standard and custom components. Most of the components are available from multiple vendors. We have several single-sourced supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us. As disclosed elsewhere, our manufacturing operations, like those of other companies, are dependent on relationship s with these suppliers who are also experiencing supply chain disruptions. If these suppliers are unable to provide a timely and reliable supply of components, we could experience manufacturing delays that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in a material way.
In addition, since the onset of the global pandemic there has been increased attention focused on actions of the Chinese government with respect to a wide range of businesses in that country. It is possible that changes in government policy in China could also disrupt the supply of components or end products we produce. 
Seasonality
In general, our business is not considered to be highly seasonal, although our first fiscal quarter revenue is often less than other quarters due to holidays and fewer shipping days. 
Research & Development and Intellectual Property Rights
Due to rapidly changing technology in the communications technology industry, we believe a large part of our success depends upon the product and service development skills of our personnel as well as our ability to integrate any acquired technologies with organically developed technologies. While we dedicate significant resources to research and development, many of our competitors are focused on a smaller set of products than us and are likely able to dedicate more resources than us toward the portions of the market in which we compete with them. 
Our proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks.
We have established common law and registered trademark rights on a family of marks for a number of our products. Our IoT Products & Services primarily are sold under the Digi®, Rabbit®, Digi XBee®, and OpenGear® brands. We believe that the Digi®and Rabbit® brands have established strong identities with our targeted customer base and our customers associate the Digi® brand with "reliability" and the Rabbit® brand with "ease of integration." We believe that our customers associate Digi XBee® with "ease of use." Many of our customers choose us because they are building a very complex system solution and they want the highest level in product reliability and ease of integration and use. Our IoT Solutions are offered under the Ventus and SmartSense by Digi® brands.
Our patents are applicable to specific technologies and are valid for varying periods of time based on the date of patent application or patent grant in the U.S. and the legal term of patents in the various foreign countries where patent protection is 
obtained. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company and products.
