 Our History 
 Our business began as the advanced manufacturing business of the Extrude Hone Corporation, which manufactured its first 3D printing machine in 2003 using licensed technology developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”). In 2005, our business assets were transferred to The Ex One Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, when Extrude Hone Corporation was acquired by a third party. In 2007, we were acquired by S. Kent Rockwell through his wholly-owned company, Rockwell Forest Products, Inc. On January 1, 2013, the Company was formed when The Ex One Company, LLC was merged with and into a Delaware corporation formed in December 2012, which changed its name to The ExOne Company. On February 12, 2013, we completed our initial public offering.

The Additive Manufacturing Industry and 3D Printing 
 3D printing is the most common type of an emerging manufacturing technology that is broadly referred to as additive manufacturing (“AM”). In general, AM is a term used to describe a manufacturing process that produces 3D objects directly from digital or computer models through the repeated deposit of very thin layers of material. 3D printing is the process of joining materials from a digital 3D model, usually layer by layer, to make objects using a printhead, nozzle, or other printing technology. The terms “AM” and “3D printing” are often used interchangeably, as the media and marketplace have popularized the term 3D printing rather than AM, which is the industry term. AM represents a transformational shift from traditional forms of manufacturing (e.g., machining or tooling), which are sometimes referred to as subtractive manufacturing. We believe that AM and 3D printing are increasingly poised to displace traditional subtractive manufacturing methodologies in a growing range of industrial applications. 
 AM methods generally include the following: 
  
- | Material extrusion;
--+--------------------


- | Material jetting;
--+------------------


- | Powder bed fusion;
--+-------------------


- | Directed energy deposition;
--+----------------------------


- | Vat photopolymerization;
--+-------------------------


- | Sheet lamination; and
--+----------------------


- | Binder jetting.
--+----------------

 Each of the methods above includes one or more underlying technologies used to address specific applications. From our inception, our focus has been specifically targeted on binder jetting technologies for industrial applications.
 Historically, AM had focused on prototyping and small, limited production in order to find acceptance of its varying technologies by end users in order to convince users of traditional methods of the viability of such new applications. As AM has evolved, the focus has progressed into production readiness and increasing reliability and repeatability standards associated with higher volumetric output and specifications that industrial applications demand for which binder jetting technologies are ideally suited. 
 ExOne and 3D Printing  
 We are a global provider of 3D printing machines and 3D printed and other products, materials and services to industrial customers. Our business primarily consists of manufacturing and selling 3D printing machines and printing products to specification for our customers using our global installed base of 3D printing machines. Our machines serve direct and indirect applications.  Direct printing produces a component; indirect printing makes a tool to produce a component. We offer pre-production collaboration and print products for customers through our network of ExOne Adoption Centers (“EACs”). We also supply the associated materials, including consumables and replacement parts, and other services, including training and technical support, that are necessary for purchasers of our 3D printing machines to print products. We believe that our ability to print in a variety of industrial materials, as well as our industry-leading volumetric output (as measured by build box size and printing speed), uniquely position us to serve the needs of industrial customers. During 2020 and 2019, sales of 3D printing machines represented 53% and 51% of our total revenue, respectively, and sales of 3D printed and other products, materials, and services, represented 47% and 49% of our total revenue, respectively.
 Our binder jetting technology was developed over 20 years ago by researchers at MIT. Our 3D printing machines build or print products from computer-aided drafting (“CAD”) models by depositing successive thin layers of particles of materials such as silicate sands or metal or ceramic powders in a “build box.” A moveable printhead passes over each layer and deposits a chemical binding agent in the selected areas where the finished product will be materialized. Each layer can be unique. 
 Depending on the industrial material used in printing (sands, metals or ceramics), printed products may require post-production processing including but not limited to, drying or curing, heat treating or sintering, machining or finishing, or other processes which are application specific.
 Pre-Print. We believe that our customers have the opportunity to take greater advantage of the design freedom that our 3D printing technology provides. Each of our 3D printing machines uses standard front-end software which gives us the ability to collaborate with our customers to develop and refine CAD designs that meet our customers’ specifications and can be read and processed by our 3D printing machines. We continue to invest in additional pre-print capabilities and resources that empower our customers to fully exploit the design freedom of 3D printing. This includes collaborative agreements, including simulation software development agreements with third parties.
 Industrial Materials. We supply printing materials to our customers that have been qualified for use with our machines. As we experience increased demand for our products globally, it is essential that the material supply chain and distribution channels be in close proximity to our current and prospective customers. For the highest quality printed products, the sand grains and metal or ceramic particles used in the 3D printing process must be uniform in size and meet very specific tolerances. We continue to focus on material development activities associated with our 3D printing process, including collaborative arrangements with customers targeted at local supply resources.
 2


Printing Platforms. Each of our 3D printing machine platforms include a computer processor which controls the printhead(s) utilized in applying layers of chemical binding agent to a material (sands, metals or ceramics) spread across the build area. Our 3D printing machines are differentiated by the varying size of our build box profiles and the speed at which we can jet chemical binding agent and effectively distribute materials in the printing process. We manufacture our 3D printing machines in both Germany and the United States. Our machines serve direct (metal or ceramic) and indirect (sand) applications. Direct printing produces a component; indirect printing makes a tool to produce a component. Our focus is on enhancing our existing machine technologies by expanding our material capabilities for both direct and indirect applications, growing the size of our platforms to meet the needs of industrial customer volume demands and optimizing the speed and quality of our printing processes.
 Our 3D printing machines are used primarily to manufacture industrial products that are ordered in various volumes, are highly complex and have a high value to the customer. Our technology is not appropriate for the mass production of simple parts, such as certain higher volume injection molded parts or certain higher volume parts made in metal stamping/forging machines. Traditional manufacturing technology is more economical in making those parts. While we expect over time to be able to increase the kinds of parts that we can make more economically than using subtractive manufacturing, we do not expect to use our technology to make simple, low-cost, mass-produced parts for the foreseeable future. 
 Post-Print Processing. After a product is printed, the bound and unbound powder in the build box requires curing of the chemical binding agent. For indirect printing of sand molds and cores, curing may occur at room temperature and the printed product is complete after the binder is cured. For certain binder types, a drying process (utilizing an industrial microwave or other means) may be necessary. The mold or core is then poured at a foundry, yielding the finished metal product. We believe that our casting technology offers a number of advantages over traditional casting methods, including enhanced design complexity, increased yield, weight reduction and improved thermal range. 
 For direct printing, the product needs to be cured and then either sintered or sintered and infiltrated. With sintering, the product is placed into a furnace in an inert atmosphere to sinter the bonded particles and form a strong bonded structure. Depending on the porosity of the bonded structure, the product can be further infiltrated with another material to fill voids. After sintering and infiltration, the product can be polished and finished with a variety of standard industrial methods and coatings. We believe that our 3D printing capabilities enable customers to develop the ideal design for products, freeing them of some of the design constraints inherent in traditional manufacturing, in the industrial material of choice and in a more efficient manner than traditional manufacturing methods. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 The principal elements of our growth strategy include: 
  
- | Expand Our Customer and Application Focus. We intend to leverage our substantial experience in binder jetting technology to focus on the highest value industries and applications. We have made a significant investment in our commercial operations to drive our growth in this area.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Extend the Capabilities of Our Core Technology. We intend to expand our core binder jetting technology through our machine platforms while at the same time lowering the total cost of ownership of our systems for our customers. We are also focused on driving modularity among our various machine platforms for both direct and indirect applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Execute on 3D Printed and Other Products, Materials and Services Revenue Growth. We intend to execute on our plan to expand our offerings for 3D printed and other products, materials and services while better leveraging our growing global installed base of 3D printers.

Customers and Sales 
 Our Customers
 Our customers are located primarily in the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific (“APAC”) regions. Our customers include a number of Fortune 500 companies that are leaders in their respective markets. During 2020 and 2019, we conducted a significant portion of our business with a limited number of customers, though not necessarily the same customers for each respective period. During 2020 and 2019, our five most significant customers represented 16.4% and 17.4% of our total revenue, respectively. During 2020 and 2019, there were no customers that individually represented 10.0% or greater of our total revenue. Sales of 3D printing machines are low volume, but generate significant revenue based on their per-unit pricing. Generally, sales of 3D printing machines are to different customers in each respective period. The timing of such sales may be dependent on various factors, including a customer’s capital budgeting cycle, its facility preparedness and the terms of the underlying arrangement with a customer (including certain substantive acceptance provisions) which may vary from period to period. The nature of our revenue from 3D printing machines does not leave us dependent upon a single or a limited number of customers. Sales of 3D printed and other products, materials and services generally result in a significantly lower aggregate price per order as compared to 3D printing machine sales. The nature of our revenue from 3D printed and other products, materials and services does not leave us dependent upon a single or a limited number of customers.

Educating Our Customers
 Educating our customers and raising awareness in our target markets about the many uses and benefits of our binder jetting technology is an important part of our sales process. We believe that customers who experience the efficiency gains, decreased lead-time, increased design flexibility, and decreased cost potential of 3D printing, as compared to subtractive manufacturing, are more likely to purchase our 3D printing machines and be repeat customers of our products and services. We educate our customers on the design freedom, speed, and other benefits of 3D printing by providing printing and design services and support through our EACs. We also seek to expose key potential users to our products through our EACs, installed machines at customers’ locations, university programs, and sales and marketing efforts. Additionally, our EACs provide our customers exposure to a greater variety of our latest machine platforms and material sets. 
ExOne Adoption Centers 
 We have established a network of EACs in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania; Troy, Michigan; Gersthofen, Germany; and Kanagawa, Japan. Each of our EACs are certified to ISO 9001:2015 standards with various scopes. Through our EACs, we provide sales and marketing and delivery of support and printing services to our customers. Our customers see our 3D printing machines in operation and can evaluate their production capabilities before ordering a 3D printing machine or a printed product or service. While our centers are scalable and have a well-defined footprint that can be easily replicated to serve additional regional markets, we are focusing on enhancing our existing centers to enable adoption rather than geographic expansion. As described below, enhancing our position in strategic locations around the world is an important part of our long-term business strategy. 
Marketing and Sales 
 We market our products under the ExOne brand name in three major geographic regions — the Americas, EMEA and APAC. Our sales are made primarily by our global sales force. Our sales force is augmented, in certain territories, by representatives with specific industry or territorial expertise. Even where we are supported by a representative, substantially all of our product and service offerings provided by our EACs are sold directly to customers by us. 
 We believe that our direct selling relationship helps to create one of the building blocks for our business — the creation of true collaboration between us and industrial customers who are interested in 3D printing. Increasingly, industrial producers are considering shifting from subtractive manufacturing techniques to 3D printing. Our marketing efforts include educating potential customers about 3D printing technology through collaboration, starting with pre-production services and continuing with production and technical support at our EACs. 
 Competition 
 Other companies are active in the market for 3D printing products and services. These companies use a variety of AM methods, including: 
  
- | Material extrusion;
--+--------------------


- | Material jetting;
--+------------------


- | Powder bed fusion;
--+-------------------


- | Directed energy deposition;
--+----------------------------


- | Vat photopolymerization;
--+-------------------------


- | Sheet lamination; and
--+----------------------


- | Binder jetting.
--+----------------

 Some of the companies that have developed and employ one or more AM technologies include: 3D Systems, Desktop Metal, EOS, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Markforged, SLM Solutions, Stratasys and Voxeljet among others.
 We also compete with established subtractive manufacturers in the industrial products market. These companies often provide large-scale, highly capitalized facilities that are designed or built to fill specific production purposes, usually mass production. However, we believe that we are well positioned to expand our share of the industrial products market from these manufacturers as AM applications increase. As our technologies improve and our unit cost of production decreases, we expect to be able to compete with subtractive manufacturing on a wide range of products, thereby expanding our addressable market. 
 We believe that our competitive strengths include: 
  
- | Volumetric Output Rate. We believe that our binder jetting technology provides us the highest rate of volume output per unit of time among competing AM technologies. Because of our early entrance into the industrial market for AM and our investment in our core 3D printing technology, we have been able to improve the printing speed and expand the build box size of our 3D printing machines. As a result, we have made strides in improving the output efficiency of our 3D printing machines, as measured by volume output per unit of time. With continued advances in our core 3D printing technologies, we believe that our cost of production will continue to decline, increasing our ability to compete with subtractive manufacturing processes, particularly for complex products, effectively expanding our addressable market.

- | Printing Platform Size. The volumetric size of the build box area upon which we construct a product is important to industrial customers who may want to either make a high number of products per job run or make an industrial product that has large dimensions and is heavy in final form. We believe that our technology and experience give us the potential to develop large footprint platforms to meet the production demands of current and potential industrial customers. In addition, we have created machine platforms in various size ranges in order to scale our technology to the varying demands of our customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Industrial Materials. Our indirect 3D printing machines are able to manufacture sand molds and cores from silica sands and other specialty materials, which are the traditional materials for these casting products. Our direct 3D printing machines are capable of printing in a variety of industrial metals and ceramics. We are in varying stages of qualifying additional industrial materials for both indirect and direct applications and advancing materials that are printable in our machines. We also use chemical binding agents during the printing process. We believe that our unique chemical binding agent technology can more readily achieve efficiency gains over time than other AM technologies, such as laser-fusing technologies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Global Presence. Since our inception, we have structured our business to address major international markets. We have strategically established one or more EACs in each of the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions. Because many of our current or potential customers are global industrial companies, it is important that we have a presence in or near the areas where these companies have manufacturing facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppliers 
 Manufacturing of our 3D printing machines includes certain components supplied via third-party contract manufacturers. Our third-party contract manufacturers provide a variety of services including sourcing off-the-shelf components, manufacturing custom components/assemblies, final product assembly and integration, end of line testing and quality assurance per our specifications. Our industrial materials are derived from several suppliers and, except as set forth below, the loss of an individual supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business. We currently have a single supplier of certain printhead components for our 3D printing machines. While we believe that this printhead component supplier is replaceable, in the event of the loss of this supplier, we could experience delays and interruptions that might adversely affect the financial performance of our business. Additionally, we obtain certain pre-production services through design and data capture providers, and certain post-production services through vendors with whom we have existing and good relationships. The loss of any one of these providers or vendors would not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Research and Development 
 We spent $8.8 million and $9.9 million on research and development during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our research and development spending has resulted in an expansion of our material printing capabilities (over 20 materials now qualified for printing on our platforms) and new platform development (including the recent market introduction of our X1 25Pro® and S-Max ProTM platforms and planned introduction of our X1 160ProTM platform in 2021).
 We expect to continue to invest in our research and development activities in the future. A significant portion of our research and development expenditures have been focused on the following: 
  
- | Properties of print materials and chemical binder formulation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


- | Mechanics of droplet flight into beds of powder;
--+-------------------------------------------------


- | Metallurgy of thermally processing metals that are printed through AM;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Mechanical design elements of our 3D printing machines;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


- | Mechanics of spreading powders in a job box;
--+---------------------------------------------


- | Evaluation of product applications utilizing our 3D printing machines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Transfer of digital data through a series of software links to drive a printhead; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Synchronizing all of the above to print ever-increasing volumes of material per unit of time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 Patents and Licenses. Significant portions of our technology are covered by a variety of patents. Through December 31, 2016, we were the worldwide licensee of certain patents held by MIT for certain AM printing processes (the “MIT Patents”), with exclusive rights to practice the patents in certain fields including the application of the printing processes to metals (with sublicensing rights), and non-exclusive rights to practice the patents in certain fields including the application of the printing processes to certain non-metals (without sublicensing rights) which gave us a significant head start in the AM industry. 
 We hold patents as a result of our own technological developments. Our patents were issued in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions, including Germany and Japan. As a result of our commitment to research and development, we also have applied for other patents for equipment, processes, materials and 3D printing applications in the United States and in various foreign countries. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2021 to 2038. We are also a minority owner of patent rights for several patents in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions as a successor interest to a 2003 agreement made between Generis GmbH and Extrude Hone GmbH.
 5


We continue from time to time to evaluate our current licenses and patents. On March 1, 2018, our ExOne GmbH subsidiary notified Voxeljet AG that it has materially breached a 2003 Patent and Know-How Transfer Agreement and asserted its rights to set off damages as a result of the breaches against the annual license fee that we pay to Voxeljet AG under the agreement.
 We have developed know-how and trade secrets relative to our 3D printing technology and believe that our early entrance into the industrial market provides us with a timing and experience advantage. Through our investment in our technology, we have been able to qualify industrial materials for use in our 3D printing machines and we intend to continue such efforts. In addition, we have taken steps to protect much of our technology as a trade secret. Given the significant steps that we have taken to establish our experience in AM for industrial applications, as well as our ongoing commitment to research and development, we intend to maintain our preeminent position in the AM industry market.

We protect this knowledge as a trade secret through the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements which all employees, customers and consultants are required to sign at the time they are employed or engaged by us. Additional information related to the risks associated with our intellectual property rights are described within Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Recent Developments
 On February 8, 2021, we announced the launch of the ExOne Metal DesignlabTM printer and X1F advanced sintering furnace in an exclusive partnership with Rapidia, a Vancouver, Canada-based technology company. This partnership allows us to expand our metal printing offerings to include an office-friendly solution that carries certain technological advantages (including proprietary materials and processing efficiency) and includes a complementary advanced sintering furnace designed by Rapidia that additionally pairs with certain of our binder jetting platforms. We expect to begin delivery of Metal Designlab units to market beginning in the second quarter of 2021.
Seasonality 
 Purchases of our 3D printing machines are often subject to the capital expenditure cycles of our customers. Generally, 3D printing machine sales are higher in our third and fourth quarters than in our first and second quarters; however, as acceptance of our 3D printing machines as a credible alternative to traditional methods of production grows, we expect to limit the seasonality we experience.
 We believe that COVID-19 may have an adverse effect on the future capital expenditure decisions of our customers outside of their normal spending cycles, which may impact the timing and extent of such decisions. 
 Backlog 
 At December 31, 2020, our backlog was approximately $39.4 million, of which approximately $33.0 million is expected to be fulfilled during the next 12 months notwithstanding uncertainty related to the impact of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, domestic and international shipping and travel restrictions brought about by COVID-19, which could have an adverse effect on the timing of delivery and installation of products and/or services to customers. At December 31, 2019, our backlog was approximately $31.1 million. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. We are not the subject of any legal or administrative proceeding relating to the environmental laws of the United States or any country in which we have an office. We have not received any notices of any violations of any such environmental laws.
