 Description of Business
 Ecoark Holdings operates through two wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, Ecoark and Magnolia Solar. Further, Ecoark has three operating subsidiaries: Zest Labs, Eco3d and Pioneer Products.
 Zest Labs
Zest Labs’ Zest Data Services is a secure, multi-tenant cloud-based data collection platform for aggregating and real-time permission-based sharing and analysis of information. Zest Fresh, a fresh food management solution that utilizes the Zest Data Service platform, focuses on three primary value propositions – consistent food quality, reduced waste, and improved food safety. Zest Fresh empowers workers with real-time analytic tools and alerts that improve efficiency while driving quality consistency through best practice adherence on every pallet of delivered fresh food. Zest Delivery offers real-time monitoring and control for prepared food delivery containers, helping delivery and dispatch personnel ensure the quality and safety of delivered food. Zest Labs was previously known as Intelleflex Corporation. Effective on October 28, 2016, Intelleflex Corporation changed its name to Zest Labs, Inc. to align its corporate name with its mission and the brand name of its products and services.
 The Zest Fresh value proposition is to reduce fresh food loss by improving quality consistency. In the U.S. produce market, it is reported that roughly 30% of post-harvest fresh food is lost or wasted and therefore not consumed. Both fresh food producers and retailers bear significant expense when harvested food is either rejected due to early spoilage, or reduced in value due to early ripening. Zest Labs believes that a significant portion of this waste can be attributed to inconsistent quality or freshness based on variable post-harvest processing and handling. Fresh food producers and retailers manage food distribution and inventory based on the harvest date, with the assumption that all food harvested on the same day will have the same freshness. However, studies have shown that post-harvest handling can have a significant effect on the actual remaining freshness, and if not properly accounted for, can result in food loss or spoilage ahead of expectations. Zest Fresh empowers fresh food producers and retailers to significantly reduce the post-harvest loss by providing real-time guidance to process adherence, intelligent distribution and best handling practices, thereby providing significant savings to fresh food producers and retailers.

Zest Fresh is offered to fresh food producers and retailers with pricing based on the number of pallets managed by Zest, typically from the field harvest through retail delivery. The Zest service includes a re-usable wireless sensor device that travels with the pallet of fresh food from the field through retail delivery, continuously collecting product condition data. The collected pallet product data is analyzed in real time by the Zest Fresh cloud application, with the fresh food producers and retailers accessing data through Zest web and mobile applications. Zest Fresh provides workers with real-time feedback on the current handling or processing of each pallet, empowering best practice adherence to achieve maximum freshness. Zest Fresh also provides real-time updates as to actual product freshness for each pallet, enabling intelligent routing and inventory management of each pallet in a manner that ensures optimum delivered freshness.

Zest Delivery manages prepared food delivery from the restaurant through to the customer. Zest Delivery manages the delivery container environment, both monitoring and controlling the product condition. The value of Zest Delivery is to manage prepared meals in an ideal state for consumption, while accommodating extended pre-staging or delivery times. Extended pre-staging times are associated with “instant delivery” services of prepared meals, where the meals are often pre-staged in a delivery area ahead of demand. While pre-staging enables fast demand response time, it can result in prepared meals being staged for extended periods. Zest Delivery monitors and controls the delivery container environment to preserve the prepared meal in ideal, ready to consume condition. Zest Delivery also provides the dispatcher with real-time remote visibility to the condition of available meals, and confirming quality prior to dispatch. Zest Delivery provides automated, real-time visibility for a very distributed fleet of drivers, reflecting prepared meal food safety, quality and availability. Zest Delivery is offered to meal delivery companies based on the quantity of delivery containers and frequency of use.
 Zest Labs currently holds rights to 65 U.S. patents, numerous related foreign patents, and U.S. copyrights relating to certain aspects of its Zest software, hardware devices including Radio-Frequency Identification (“RFID”) technology, software, and services. In addition, Zest Labs has registered, and/or has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for “Intelleflex,” the Intelleflex logo, “Zest,” “Zest Data Services,” and the Zest logo, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Many of Zest Labs’ products have been designed to include licensed intellectual property obtained from third-parties. Laws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs operates and seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates.

Although most components essential to Zest Labs’ business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain RFID custom integrated circuits, and application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”) are currently obtained by Zest Labs from single or limited sources, principally in Asia.
 Zest Labs is part of a very competitive industry that markets solutions to cold supply chain users, such as fresh food growers and retailers. Many other companies, that are both more established and have much greater resources compete in this market. While Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery offer new technical approaches and new user value, it remains uncertain if Zest Labs will gain sufficient adoption of its products to make them viable in the market. Further, it is unclear what industry competitors are developing that might address similar user needs. Zest Labs’ products provide a new approach for industry participants, and as with any new approach, adoption is uncertain as many in the industry can be slow to embrace new technology and/or new approaches. These market challenges can lead to extended sales cycles, that may include extended pilot testing often at Zest Labs’ expense, for which the outcome remains unclear until the completion of each test. For these reasons, and others, forecasting new business adoption and future revenue can be very difficult and volatile. 
 Eco3d
Eco3d is a services-based company that utilizes LiDAR laser scanning technology to capture existing conditions from natural or man-made structures by creating a 3d data point cloud. These point clouds represent highly accurate dimensional data clearly identifying the X, Y, and Z location from the scanner that emitted millions of points of light from a single position. Eco3d scans the same subject area from different positions to provide even more 3d data. The raw data is registered/meshed together to create a federated data set that is then used to create 2d deliverables or 3d models. 
 This process represents one of the fastest and most accurate forms of non-contact 3d measurement. The value proposition that Eco3d provides involves utilizing this technology to ultimately save money on labor and materials as it relates to project costs. Secondary, but significant additional propositions include measuring at a distance to maintain the safety of the workforce; helping quality assurance or assessment and control of a structure for overall asset management over the life of a project; providing meta-data to be used in the maintenance of the structure; providing virtual design validation; and communicating the existing conditions to allow for prototype solutions. 
 Eco3d provides this measuring service throughout North America to clients who want to improve their short-term and long-term operational efficiency. The primary markets are construction, manufacturing, real estate, retail, energy, high purity, and healthcare. All of these industries are in their infancy of utilizing this technology which also makes Eco3d their consultant on the integration of this new technology and proprietary processes. The revenue sources from these existing and target industries represent significant market opportunity. Furthermore, this technology will form the basis for the upcoming democratization of augmented reality and virtual reality. The opportunities for integration know no boundaries geographically, politically, or economically. We live in a 3-dimensional world and this is one of the fastest, least expensive, forms of digitizing/computerizing technology.
 Pioneer Products
Pioneer Products began by creating new consumer products using plastic reclaimed from post-consumer and retailers’ waste streams. One of these products is Pioneer Products’ “close-looped” 45-gallon trash can. Pioneer Products generates revenue from the sale of products such as plastic trash cans to 3,700 retail stores, including the largest retailer in the continental U.S., Walmart, a major customer of the Company. Pioneer Products’ competitors include large consumer products companies such as Rubbermaid and Hefty. 
 Building on a platform of proven retail success, Pioneer Products leverages its reputation and strategic network by acting as a broker for other products and companies that fit into its brand portfolio. Pioneer owns direct vendor relationships and vendor numbers with some of the largest retailers in the U.S. This vendor number facilitates introduction of a new product to a retailer. Additionally, Pioneer’s offerings enable Ecoark to play a key role in supporting and making good on some of Walmart’s goals of retail-level sustainability: reduction of waste within its supply chain and operations. 
 On May 3, 2016, Sable Polymer Solutions, LLC (“Sable”) was acquired by Ecoark Holdings and Pioneer Products for 2,000 shares of Ecoark Holdings common stock. Sable is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pioneer Products. Sable specializes in the purchase, sale, and processing of post-consumer and post-industrial plastic materials. It provides services to a variety of customers and suppliers throughout the plastics processing industry, from small extruders, molders and scrap collectors to large corporations.
Magnolia Solar
Magnolia Solar is principally engaged in the development and commercialization of nanotechnology-based, high-efficiency, thin-film technology that can be deposited on a variety of substrates, including glass and flexible structures. Magnolia Solar believes that this technology has the potential to capture a larger part of the solar spectrum to produce high-efficiency solar cells and incorporates a unique nanostructure-based antireflection coating technology to possibly further increase the solar cell’s performance. If these goals are met, there is the potential of significantly reducing the cost per watt. Since its inception, Magnolia Solar has not generated material revenues or earnings as a result of its activities. 
 Competition
The Company’s subsidiaries operate in markets for products and services that are highly competitive and face aggressive competition in all areas of their business. 
 The market for cloud-based, real-time supply chain analytic solutions—the market in which Zest Labs competes—is rapidly evolving. There are several new competitors with competing technologies, including companies that have greater resources than Ecoark Holdings, which operate in this space. Some of these companies have brand recognition, established relationships with retailers, and own the manufacturing process. 
 Eco3d competes in the market for building information modeling for owners, architects, engineers, planners, surveyors, developers, and contractors for redevelopment, civil engineering, and other requirements. The market for these services is highly competitive with several large companies competing. Many large potential customers have their own teams that perform similar functions for their requirements, limiting access to some market participants.

Pioneer Products competes in the market for recycled products to support sustainability programs of its customers. There are currently hundreds of sustainability programs available in the market. These programs are offered through retailers, manufacturers, and service providers. Several competitors operating in this industry are vertically integrated and offer recycled products similar to those sold by Pioneer.
 The market for electricity from renewable sources—the market in which Magnolia Solar competes—is still evolving and is dependent on government incentives and subsidies in the U.S. Several large companies and some foreign nation states aggressively compete to expand their portfolio of products/services for renewable energy solutions. Intense competition in the solar power energy sector has created financial pressures for many market participants.
 Ecoark Holdings believes that, analyzing the competitive factors affecting the market for the solutions and services its subsidiaries provide, its products/services compete favorably by offering integrated solutions to their customers. The Company has incurred research and development expenses of $5,979 and $2,801 in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to develop its solutions and differentiate those solutions from competitive offerings.
