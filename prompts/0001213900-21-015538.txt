BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Genie Energy Ltd. is a global provider of energy services that, through various subsidiaries and other ventures, supplies electricity, and natural gas to residential and small business customers in certain portions of the United States, Europe and Asia. Additionally, through its Genie Energy Services division, the Company provides commercial and industrial brokerage, commercial solar consultative services, design, supply and installation and community solar marketing services.

The Company owns 99.3% of its subsidiary, Genie Energy International Corporation ("GEIC"), which owns 100% of Genie Retail Energy ("GRE"), 100% of Genie Retail Energy International LLC ("GREI"), 100% of Genie Energy Services ("GES") and 97% of Genie Oil and Gas, Inc. ("GOGAS"). 

GRE owns and operates retail energy providers ("REPs"), including IDT Energy, Inc. ("IDT Energy"), Residents Energy, LLC ("Residents Energy"), Town Square Energy, LLC and Town Square Energy East, LLC ("collectively, "TSE"), Southern Federal Power ("SFP") and Mirabito Natural Gas, ("Mirabito"). GRE's REP businesses resell electricity and natural gas to residential and small business customers. The majority of GRE's customers are located in the Eastern and Midwestern United States and Texas. Mirabito supplies only natural gas to commercial customers in Florida. 

GREI holds the Company's REPs that serves retail customers in the United Kingdom under the name Orbit Energy and in Japan ("Genie Japan"). It holds a 92.5% controlling interest in Lumo Energia Oyj ("Lumo Finland"), a REP serving residential customers in Finland and 100.0% of Lumo Energi AB ("Lumo Sweden"), which serves retail customers in Sweden. 

GES holds a 100% interest in Diversegy LLC (Diversegy), a retail energy advisory and brokerage company that serves commercial and industrial customers throughout the United States and manages our 60.0%  controlling interest in Prism Solar Technology, Inc. ("Prism"), a solar solutions company that is engaged in solar project marketing, solar solutions consultation, installation design and project management services. 

 GOGAS has concluded its oil and gas exploration operations and is winding down its remaining operations. In December 2020, Afek Oil & Gas Ltd. ("Afek"), a subsidiary which had been operating an oil and gas exploration project in the Golan Heights in Northern Israel, completed the final tests on one of its completed exploratory wells. Analysis of the tests' results found no traces of light oil resources suitable for commercial development. As a result, Afek ceased its exploratory operations. 

CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19)  

Starting in the first quarter of 2020, the world and the United States experienced the unprecedented impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the impacts of COVID-19 were evident in several key aspect of our business operations and the corresponding financial impact has been mixed. Our customers are predominantly residential, so we benefited from the increased demand for electricity as many customers are working from and spending more time in their homes. On the other hand, like other retail energy providers, the Company suspended its face-to-face customer acquisition programs in March 2020 as public health measures were implemented to combat COVID-19, resulting in a decrease in gross meter acquisitions. The reduction in gross meter acquisitions decreased customer acquisition expenses in 2020 and limited growth in domestic meters served. Churn in 2020 decreased in part, as our competitors also suspended their face-face marketing programs. COVID-19 public health restrictions relaxed in some of GRE's domestic market in the third quarter of 2020, facilitating a partial reactivation of the previously curtailed customer acquisition channels.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
 
In December 2020, we revised our reportable segments in connection with the conclusion of our final exploration activities of GOGAS, as discussed above. The assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows related to the activities of GOGAS were aggregated with corporate for all periods presented.

The change in reportable segments did not result in a reallocation of the Company's existing goodwill. 

We now have three reportable business segments: GRE, GRE International and GES. Our reportable segments are distinguished by types of service, customers and customer geography. Financial information by segment and geographic areas is presented in “Note 18 — Business Segment Information” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

BUSINESS

Genie Retail Energy

Overview
 
GRE is comprised of REPs and related businesses. GRE’s REP businesses purchase electricity and/or natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell these commodities to their residential and business customers in deregulated markets in the United States. The positive difference between the net sales price of electricity and natural gas sold to its customers and the cost of their electricity and natural gas supplies and related costs are the REP businesses’ gross profits. 
 
GRE’s U.S. REP businesses operate in certain utility territories within the deregulated retail energy markets of sixteen states in the United States: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Rhode Island and Texas, as well as in Washington, D.C. As part of our ongoing business development efforts, we evaluate opportunities in other deregulated jurisdictions to accelerate the growth of our customer base and to reduce operational and regulatory risk associated with geographical concentration.
 
GRE’s  REP businesses operate under several brand names including IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy, Southern Federal Power and Mirabito. GRE's diverse offerings, in both the electricity and natural gas markets included either variable rate or fixed rate offerings or both. Throughout their electricity market, GRE's REPs offer green electricity. Green electricity supply is 100% matched with renewable energy certificates, or RECs that reflect the generation of electricity from renewable sources.
 
Historically, GRE has expanded its REP businesses through organic growth of its REPs adding new customers through customer acquisition programs at a rate faster than customers lost through attrition or churn – as well as through acquisitions of other REPs and books of business. New customers are generally acquired through a combination of marketing and sales channels including door-to-door solicitation, telemarketing, online and digital marketing, direct mail, and by competitive bidding for exclusive contracts awarded by certain municipalities, where authorized by state laws. These municipal aggregation contracts award participating residents’ electricity supply to a single supplier at a fixed price that is typically established through a competitive bidding process.
 
GRE evaluates its customers base both in terms of the numbers of commodity meters served and the number of Residential Customer Equivalents ("RCEs") represented by these meters. An RCE is a unit of measure denoting the typical annual commodity consumption of a single-family residential customer. One RCE represents 1,000 therms of natural gas or 10,000 kWh of electricity.
Customer churn is a significant factor in the REP business. GRE's REPs monthly churn rates average between four and seven percent per month. Customer churn tends to decrease when commodity prices fall, when weather-driven consumption decreases, when the price to REP customers decreases relative to competitors including the incumbent utility provider, or when the REPs incentivize customer tenure. Customer churn tends to increase when commodity prices rise, when weather driven consumption increases or spikes, or when the price to REP customers increases relative to the prices charged by competitors including incumbent utility providers. Newly acquired customers typically have higher rates of churn than longer-tenured customers. 
 
  
GRE’s revenue comprises approximately 80.5% and 90.9% of our total consolidated revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, GRE generated revenue of $305.3 million comprised of $270.9 million from sales of electricity, $33.6 million from sales of natural gas, and a minimal amount of other revenue, as compared with revenue of $286.6 million in 2019, comprised of $246.7 million from the sales of electricity, $39.9 million from the sales of natural gas and a minimal amount of other revenue. GRE's electricity sales as a percentage of total sales have increased in recent years.
 
GRE’s REP revenue is seasonal. Approximately 47.7% and 46.9% of our natural gas revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were generated during the first quarter, when the demand for heating peaks. Although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas, approximately 31.8% of total revenues from electricity sales in 2020 and 2019, were generated in the third quarter when the demand for cooling peaks.
 
Unusual weather patterns can significantly impact GRE’s financial results. For example, a polar vortex resulted in unusually sustained cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. This increased demand was characterized by extraordinarily large spikes in the wholesale prices GRE paid for its electricity and natural gas supplies. As a result, GRE's REP experience abnormally high rates of churn and the Company refunded a significant amount to its variable rate customers to cushion the impacts on their monthly bills. Potential changes in global climate may produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in unusual weather conditions, more intense, frequent and extreme weather events and other natural disasters. Some climatologists believe that these extreme weather events will become more common and more extreme which will have a greater impact on our operations.
As of December 31, 2020, GRE serviced 370,000 meters (305,000 electric and 65,000 natural gas), compared to 370,000 meters (297,000 electric and 73,000 natural gas) as of December 31, 2019. 
 
REP Industry Overview
 
REPs operate in deregulated retail energy markets in the US. REPs purchase electricity and natural gas on the wholesale markets and resell these commodities to their customers including homeowners, renters and small to mid-sized commercial and governmental operations and institutions. Generally, incumbent local utilities continue to handle electricity and natural gas distribution, billing, and collections. The utilities remit the proceeds collected for the commodity supply portion of their bills less certain fees to the REPs.
 
REPs generally have no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Their cost of revenue is incurred to purchase electricity and natural gas in their respective wholesale markets and other factors. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customer acquisition, customer retention, billing and purchase of receivables, or POR, fees paid to the utilities, and program management.
 
As of December 31, 2020, there were thirty U.S. states in which there is some level of energy deregulation. We currently market in all the states where residential deregulation covers both electricity and natural gas and in some states where residential deregulation covers only one commodity. We are in the process of applying for licenses or setting up operations in certain such states and are constantly evaluating market opportunities in others. 

Some competitors in certain REP markets have engaged in unfair business practices in order to recruit new customers. These practices can create an unfavorable impression about our industry with consumers, regulators or political bodies. Further, such practices can lead to regulatory action that negatively impact us and the industry.

  Customers; Marketing
 
The services of GRE’s U.S. REPs - IDT Energy, Residents Energy, Town Square Energy, Southern Federal Power and Mirabito - are made available to customers under several offerings with distinct terms and conditions. The offerings include variable rate programs whose prices change month-to-month, fixed contracts whose unit price remains the same for the agreed upon term and renewable contracts. A significant portion of our customer base is enrolled in variable rate products, which enable us to recover our wholesale costs for electricity and natural gas by adjusting the rates we charge to our customers. The frequency and degree of these rate adjustments are determined by GRE. Variable rate products are available to all customers in all states served by GRE’s REPs except for Connecticut.

As of December 31, 2020, customers on variable rate products constituted approximately 57.2% of our electric load. The balance comprised customers on fixed rate agreements. 
 
GRE’s REPs offer renewable or green energy supply options in all their markets. Renewable electricity supply is 100% matched with renewable energy certificates, or RECs, that reflect the generation of electricity from sources such as hydro-electric wind, solar and biomass.
 
The electricity and natural gas we sell through all of our offerings are metered and delivered to customers by the local utilities. The utilities also provide billing and collection services for the majority of our customers. For a small number of customers, we perform our own billing and collection. 

In many states, GRE’s REPs’ receivables are purchased by the utilities in their territories for a percentage of their face value. Over the course of 2020, the associated cost was approximately 1.2% of GRE's revenue in exchange, the utility accepts a first priority lien against the customer receivable without recourse to the REP. Programs operating within this framework are preferred to as purchase of receivables, or POR, programs, and they mitigate our credit risk. At December 31, 2020, 87.0% of GRE’s net accounts receivables were under a POR program.

Certain utilities in Connecticut, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and Maryland offer POR programs, without recourse. these programs permit customers with past-due balances to remain in the POR and consolidated bill programs. However, utilities in New Jersey generally do not permit customers with past-due balances beyond 120 days to enroll or remain in their POR programs. After a certain amount of time (determined based on the specific commodity), the REP becomes responsible for the billing and collection of the commodity portion of the future invoices for its delinquent customers. Certain utilities in Delaware, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio and Rhode Island do not offer POR but they do offer consolidated billing. In Florida and Texas, there are no POR programs and the customers are billed directly.
 
GRE targets markets in which we can procure energy in an efficient and transparent manner. We seek to purchase wholesale energy where there is a real-time market that reflects a fair commodity price for all participants. This allows GRE to reflect a true market cost base and adjust its rates to its variable rate customers taking into account prevailing market rates.
 
We regularly monitor deregulated or deregulating markets in states where we do not yet operate to determine whether and under what conditions we could operate profitability. We may initiate the licensing process in a selected region to facilitate entry into that region contingent upon favorable deregulatory developments.

  Procurement and Management of Gas and Electric Supply

Certain of GRE's REPs are party to an Amended and Restated Preferred Supplier Agreement with BP Energy Company, or BP, through November 30, 2023. Under the agreement, the REPs purchase electricity and natural gas at market rate plus a fee. The obligations to BP are secured by a first security interest in deposits or receivables from utilities in connection with their purchase of the REP’s customer’s receivables, and in any cash deposits or letters of credit posted in connection with any collateral accounts with BP. The ability to purchase electricity and natural gas under this agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. 
 
GRE is required to meet certain minimum green energy supply criteria in some of the markets in which it operates. We meet those thresholds by acquiring renewable energy certificates, or REC’s. In addition, GRE offers green or other renewable energy products to its customers in all of the territories in which we operate. GRE acquires green renewable energy conversion rights or attributes and REC’s to satisfy the load requirements for these customers.
 
GRE does not own electrical power generation, transmission, or distribution facilities, or natural gas production, pipeline or distribution facilities. For their natural gas supply, GRE’s REPs currently contract with Dominion Transmission, Inc., National Fuel Supply, Williams Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission and others for natural gas pipeline, storage and transportation services. For electricity supply, they, utilize the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., or NYISO, and PJM Interconnection, LLC, or PJM, for electric transmission and distribution. NYISO operates the high-voltage electric transmission network in New York State, and administers and monitors New York’s wholesale electricity markets. PJM is a regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of thirteen states (including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Illinois) and the District of Columbia. In Texas, SFP acquires power through the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).
 
For risk management purposes, GRE’s REPs utilize forward physical delivery contracts for a portion of their purchases of electricity and natural gas, which are defined as commodity derivative contracts. In addition, GRE’s REPs enter into put and call options as hedges against unfavorable fluctuations in market prices of electricity and natural gas.
 
The ISOs perform real-time load balancing for each of the electrical power grids in which GRE REPs operate. Similarly, load balancing is performed by the utilities or local distribution company, or LDC, for each of the natural gas markets in which GRE operates. Load balancing ensures that the amount of electricity and natural gas that GRE’s REPs purchase is equal to the amount necessary to service its customers’ demands at any specific point in time. GRE’s REPs are charged or credited for balancing the electricity and natural gas purchased and sold for their account by their suppliers and the LDCs. GRE’s REPs manage the differences between the actual electricity and natural gas demands of their customers and their bulk or block purchases by buying and selling in the spot market, and through monthly cash settlements and/or adjustments to future deliveries in accordance with the load balancing performed by utilities, LDCs, and/or ISOs.

Competition
 
As an operator of REPs, GRE competes with the local utility companies in each of the markets in which it provides services and with many other licensed REPs. In some markets, competitor REPs are affiliated with local utilities. GRE also competes with several large vertically integrated energy companies as well as smaller independent operators. Competition with the utilities and REPs impacts GRE’s gross margins, customer acquisition rates and exposes GRE to customer churn.
 
REPs and utilities offering fixed rate products or guaranteed pricing often are unable to change their sell rates offered to customers in response to underlying commodity price volatility. In a downward moving commodity cost environment, variable rate REPs typically become more competitive as they benefit from the lag that utilities experience in reducing their sell rate to reflect the lower commodity costs, and they may benefit from decreases in margin pressure, improvements in the customer acquisition environment, and lower rates of churn. In a rising commodity cost environment, REPs that offer variable rate products, and reflect real-time commodity costs, will typically become less competitive with fixed rate providers, experience increased margin pressure, a more challenging customer acquisition environment and higher rates of customer churn.
 
Increasing our market share depends in part on our ability to persuade more customers to switch from other providers to one of our REPs at a higher rate than our customers churn to other providers. Moreover, local utilities and some REPs may have certain advantages such as name recognition, financial strength and long-standing relationships with customers. Persuading potential customers to switch to GRE requires significant marketing and sales operations.
 
Regulation 
 
REPs such as ours must be licensed in each state and utility service territory in which they operate. Each is subject to the rules and regulations governing the operations of REPs in each jurisdiction.
 
Although the rates charged by GRE’s REPs are not regulated in the same way as the rates of utility companies, the manner in which the REPs market to potential customers, and the relationships between the REPs and their customers, are heavily regulated. GRE’s REPs must also comply with various quarterly and/or annual reporting requirements in order to maintain their eligibility to provide service. In certain jurisdictions the REPs are required to publish product offers with the applicable regulatory commissions, or in the public domain, generally on a website established for such purpose. In addition to the regulations that govern the relationships between GRE’s REPs and their customers, GRE’s REPs also maintain specific Terms & Conditions or Terms of Service for each product in each jurisdiction that the parties agree to be bound by.
 
The Company is party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including those with utility commissions or other government regulatory or law enforcement agencies. 

As of December 31, 2020, GRE’s REPs operate in sixteen states and District of Columbia. The State of New York, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of New Jersey, the State of Maryland, the State of Illinois, the State of Ohio, the State of Michigan , the State of New Hampshire, the State of Rhode Island, the State of  Connecticut, the State of Florida, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the State of Delaware, the State of Maine, the State of Texas, the State of Georgia. The federal government and related public service/utility commissions, among others, establish the rules and regulations for our REP operations

Like all operators of REPs, GRE is affected by the actions of governmental agencies, mostly on the state level, by the respective state Public Service/Utility Commissions, and other organizations (such as NYISO, ERCOT and PJM) and indirectly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Regulations applicable to electricity and natural gas have undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. We may be subject to new laws, orders or regulations or the revision or interpretation of existing laws, orders or regulations.
 New York Public Service Commission Orders

In December 2017, the New York Public Service Commission (“PSC”) held an evidentiary hearing to assess the retail energy market in New York. On December 12, 2019, following the completion of the post-hearing briefings in the proceedings, the PSC issued orders adopting changes to the New York retail energy market, effective April 16, 2020 (“2020 Orders”).  The 2020 Orders limits the types of services energy retailer marketers may offer new customers or renewals, in terms of pricing for non-renewable commodities, and renewable product offerings. Although the Company is working to ensure that its products and services are fully compatible with the 2020 Orders, such compliance may adversely impact customer acquisition and renewal revenue and profitability.  The Company is evaluating its options, both by itself and in tandem with other industry participants, to challenge or petition for additional clarity and changes to the 2020 Orders. There is insufficient basis to deem any loss probable or to assess the amount of any possible loss based on the changes instituted by the 2020 Orders. As of December 31, 2020, New York represented 19.4%of GRE’s total meters served and 14.7%of the total residential customer equivalents (“RCEs”) of GRE’s customer base. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, New York gross revenues were $56.7 million and $63.2 million, respectively.

A RCE represents a natural gas customer with annual consumption of 100 mmbtu or an electricity customer with annual consumption of 10 MWh. Because different customers have different rates of energy consumption, RCEs are an industry standard metric for evaluating the consumption profile of a given retail customer base.

State of Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority
 On September 19, 2018, the State of Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (“PURA”) commenced an investigation into Town Square following customer complaints of allegedly misleading and deceptive sales practices on the part of Town Square. The Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel had joined in the investigation. Although Town Square denies any basis for those complaints and any wrongdoing on its part, it is cooperating with the investigation and responding to subpoenas for discovery. On June 17, 2020, the PURA or Authority notified Town Square that it was advancing its investigation by assigning Prosecutorial (PRO) staff for the purpose of investigating Town Square’s compliance with licensed electric supplier billing, marketing, and licensing requirements, and, if appropriate, facilitating settlement discussions among the parties that contains, but is not limited to, an appropriate civil penalty, extensive retraining of the supplier’s third-party agents, and retention of all sales calls with continued auditing.  If a settlement is not achieved and PRO staff believe the Authority should take further action regarding alleged non-compliance, the Authority requests that PRO staff petition the Authority setting forth its recommendations citing to supporting facts and law. As of December 31, 2020, Town Square’s Connecticut customer base represented 11.6% of GRE’s total meters served and 12.8% of the total residential customer equivalents of GRE’s customer base. As of December 31, 2020, no claims or demands have been made against Town Square by either agency, and there is insufficient basis to deem the loss probable or to the assess the amount of any possible loss. Nevertheless, the parties have begun to engage in preliminary settlement discussions.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the enforcement division of PURA contacted Residents Energy concerning customer complaints received in connection with alleged door-to-door marketing activities in violation of various rules and regulations, including a ban on door-to-door activities during the pertinent time period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents Energy denies any allegations of wrongdoing. In January and February of 2021, Residents Energy responded to the limited information requests and discovery made by the enforcement division. On March 12, 2021, the enforcement division filed a motion against Resident Energy with the adjudicating body of PURA, seeking the assessment of $1.5 million in penalties, along with a suspension of license for eighteen months, auditing of marketing practices upon reinstatement and an invitation for settlement discussions. As noted above, Residents Energy denies any wrongdoing, and there is insufficient basis to deem or assess the probably amount of any loss. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, gross revenues from sales in Connecticut were $38.0 million and $35.6 million, respectively.
 In response to complaints that IDT Energy enrolled consumers without their express consent and misrepresented the amount of savings those consumers would receive, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois (“IL AG”) has been investigating the marketing practices of IDT Energy and has alleged violations of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/1 et seq. and the Illinois Telephone Solicitations Act, 815 ILCS 413/1 et seq. Shortly thereafter, the Illinois Commerce Commission ("IL ICC") commenced a similar investigation. Although IDT Energy denies any wrongdoing in connection with those allegations, the parties (including IL ICC) settled the matter pursuant to a court approved consent decree that includes restitution payments in the amount of $3.0 million, temporary suspension of all marking activities directed at new customers through December 31, 2020, and implementation of various compliance and reporting procedures. 
In third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a liability of $3.0 million recorded as a reduction of electricity revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2020, Illinois represented 2.5% of GRE’s total meters served and 1.2% of the total residential customer equivalents of GRE’s customer base. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, IDT Energy’s gross revenues from sales in Illinois were $7.0 million and $10.1 million, respectively.

Employees

As of March 5, 2021, GRE employed 125 full time employees, 57 of whom are located in the Jamestown, New York office, 48 of whom are located in our New Jersey office, 13 of whom are located in our Arizona office and 7 is located in Texas with SFP.
GRE International

GRE International is comprised of REPs operating in the U.K., in Finland, through our 92.5% interest in Lumo Finland, in Japan, and in Sweden. GRE’s REP businesses purchase electricity on the wholesale markets and resell these commodities to their residential customers through both variable rate and fixed rate programs.

GRE International's REP businesses operate under several brand names including Lumo Energia, Genie Energy Japan, and Orbit Energy (United Kingdom). Lumo Finland, Lumo Sweden and Genie Energy Japan resell electricity, while Orbit Energy supplies both electricity and natural gas.

On October 8, 2020, the Company acquired the remaining 23.0% interest in Orbit Energy that it did not previously own, which increased the Company's interest to 100%. Prior to October 8, 2020, GRE International accounted for its investments in Orbit Energy under the equity method of accounting. 

As of December 31, 2020, GRE International's REPs, including Orbit Energy, served 195,000 meters, an increase from 127,000 meters as of December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the continuous investment in the growth of Lumo Finland, Orbit Energy and Genie Japan. The Company also started the commercial operations of Lumo Sweden in the second quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, GRE International served 103,000 RCEs, an increase from 65,000 RCEs as of December 31, 2019. The increase in RCEs primarily resulted from the increase in meters served as discussed above.

Nordic Electricity Market

Lumo Finland and Lumo Sweden (together, Lumo) serve the Nordic electricity market. 

The Nordic electricity system utilizes a mixture of generation sources. Hydro, nuclear biomass and wind power are among the main primary sources of electricity generation. The Nordic region has a large share of electricity heated houses, resulting in a consumption profile that is higher than in the rest of the European Union (“EU”). Electricity consumption is highly dependent on weather factors, with lower electricity demand in the summer and increased consumption in the wintertime. 

Lumo's REPs generally have no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Their cost of revenue is incurred through the purchase of electricity and natural gas in their respective wholesale markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customers acquisitions, customer retention, billing and collections.

Lumo Finland

Lumo Finland was founded in 2015 and began servicing customers in 2016. Lumo Finland operates in the Finnish electricity market. The Company acquired an 80.0% controlling interest of Lumo Finland in January 2019 and has since increased its ownership to 92.5%. Lumo Finland operates in all of Finland and sells electricity primarily to private consumers and small businesses. 

Lumo Finland's revenue is seasonal. Approximately 62.8% of total revenues in 2020 were generated in the winter (28.4% in first quarter of 2020 and 34.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020) when the demand for heating is high. Approximately 64.1% of total revenues in 2019 were generated in the winter (31.4%  in first quarter of 2019 and 32.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019).

Lumo Sweden

Lumo Sweden is a Swedish REP founded in October 2019. Lumo Sweden started its commercial operations in April 2020. Its customers are spread across Sweden, and are primarily residential with some being small business. In 2020, as a start-up year, Lumo Sweden mostly focused on growing its customer base and developing its strategy.

The Swedish electricity market is divided into four different price areas based on geographic location. The capital Stockholm region is the biggest market for Lumo Sweden. Historically, the price for supply in the northern price areas has been the cheaper compared to the other price areas in the southern part of the country, due to a number of hydroelectric power plans and lower demand. The price in the south, however, has been the higher due to a higher demand with lower local supply, mostly solar and wind.

Marketing

Lumo acquires customers primarily through branded and affiliated websites. Lumo's marketing efforts focus on digital channels such as search engine marketing, social media, display and email marketing. These digital channels are designed to drive traffic to Lumo's branded websites. Lumo's branded site offers customers variable rate and fixed rate products. Remarketing for customers who have already visited the website is done as display advertising on both social media and search engines.
The customers are also offered multiple billing and payment methods in order to make payment convenient. The customer can also access their consumption through an online portal where they can access their invoices, payments, contract and other documents.
Acquisition and Management of Electric Supply
 The Nordic electricity market consists of various marketplaces that are “time windows” for physical trading in electricity: the day-ahead market, the intra-day market and the balancing market. In the Nordic countries, the vast majority of trading is done on the day-ahead market (spot market), and the “system price”, which is the common Nordic price for all hours of the next following 24-hour period, is crucial for price formation within the other time windows (the intra-day and balancing markets and the financial market for long-term contracts).
 
The intra-day market is primarily a correction market, where participants have the opportunity to trade into balance, including adjusting any earlier trading. The intra-day market closes one hour before the delivery hour. The balancing market is trading in automatic and manual reserves used by the Nordic transmission system operators (“TSOs”) in order to maintain power balance during the hour of operation. Nord Pool Spot is responsible for the day-ahead market and the intra-day market, while the TSOs are responsible for the balancing market.

For risk management purposes, Lumo typically employs put and call options as hedges against unfavorable fluctuations in market prices of electricity. The hedges are usually done 3 to 6 months ahead of delivery depending on estimated volumes.
 Competition
 There are dozens of registered REPs in Finland and Sweden, including those operated by energy producers, affiliates of local grid companies and independent contractors. In recent years, the REP industry has experienced consolidation resulting in larger REPs. 

 A significant portion of Finland’s residential customer base continue to purchase its supply from their local grid company’s affiliate REPs despite the proliferation of competitive suppliers. Most new REPs seek to build market share with aggressive pricing. The main focus of Lumo is to gain new customers, upgrading these customers to better margin products while controlling churn and balancing growth and profitability.

Regulation

Each REP in Finland or Sweden must be registered with each countries' Energy Authority in order to be able to operate. Although REPs enjoy certain freedom with respect to their operations (i.e. marketing and pricing), they must comply with various regulations and laws, including Finnish or Swedish Energy authority rules and regulation governing electricity supply pricing, marketing, types of offerings and contracts, as well as general guidelines set forth in the Finnish  or Swedish Electricity Market Law. 
Genie Energy Japan

The Japanese electricity market became deregulated in April 2016. Presently, there are approximately 750 REPs licensed in Japan. REPs purchase electricity on the wholesale markets and resell the commodities to their customers, who may include homeowners, renters and small to mid-sized commercial and governmental operations and institutions. The local utilities continue to handle electricity transmission and distribution, line maintenance and meter reading with the REP’s responsible for invoicing the customer and collecting payments for both the commodity and transmission and distribution portions of the services. The REPs remits the transmission and distribution portion of the bill to the utilities.

REPs in Japan generally have no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Their cost of revenues is incurred to purchase electricity and natural gas in their respective wholesale markets and other factors. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customer acquisition, customer retention, billing, and collections.  

Genie Japan operates in nine of the ten deregulated electric utility territories in Japan, with Okinawa being the only territory where it does not operate. Genie Japan offers both variable rate and fixed rates to its customers.

In January 2021, the Company experienced unprecedented price volatility in the Japanese market. These events are expected to have an estimated adverse impact on our first quarter of 2021 consolidated results of operations of $2.5 million.
 
Marketing

New customers are acquired through a combination of marketing and sales channels including door-to-door solicitation, telemarketing, affinity partner sales, and online and digital marketing. Products are made available to customers under several offerings with distinct terms and conditions. Similar to the United States, a significant portion of new customers are enrolled in variable rate programs via automatically renewing or month-to-month agreements, which enable us to adjust the cost of electricity to the rates charged to our customers. The frequency and degree of these rate adjustments is not restricted by regulation.

During 2020 physical sales were reduced due to Covid-19. From April to June 2020 a national state of emergency suspended door-to-door sales completely. In August 2020 and in January 2021, the government had declared state of emergencies and urged citizens to stay at home as much as possible. These periods resulted in reduced physical sales capabilities.

 Genie Japan offers three payment types: credit card, auto bank draft, and convenience store payment for customers' convenience.

Acquisition and Management of Electric Supply

Genie Japan procures electricity for its customers through forward monthly supply transactions from wholesale electricity providers, as well as day-ahead spot electricity purchases on Japan Electric Power Exchange ("JEPX"). Currently, Genie Japan is acquiring electricity with five wholesale electricity supply companies. A third party vendor performs the scheduling of our forward supply purchases and makes purchases, or sales, on our behalf for any additional electricity needed for our customers on the day ahead JEPX market.
 
Electricity for our customers is scheduled through Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators, Japan ("OCCTO"), which coordinates with the nine electric utility companies for the transmission and delivery of our electricity supply. These contracts are typically provided by wholesalers which purchase bulk generation supply and on-sell to retailers. In addition, wholesalers can also provide physical contracts that are backed by financial contracts traded on one of two futures exchanges. Genie Japan also can use trade over-the-counter swaps. 
 
Our electricity purchases that are less, or greater, than our customers actual usage is settled through purchases, or sales, respectively, in the balancing market. Each of the nine utility companies will perform this balance service for the actual load of our customer and the supply delivered. The utilities invoice Genie Japan on a monthly basis for additional charges, or credits, resulting from these balancing.
 
For risk management purposes, Genie Japan utilize forward physical delivery contracts for portions of our purchases of electricity to reduce price risks.

Competition

Presently, there are approximately 750 REPs licensed in Japan. In some territories, competitor REPs are affiliated with local utilities. Genie Japan also competes with several large vertically integrated energy companies as well as smaller independent operators. Some of the REPs only operate regionally, while others, like Genie Japan, sell throughout Japan. 

Many of the REPs pricing structure have a variable component that is based on an energy cost index from a trailing 3 or 6 months period, while Genie Japan pricing is based on future market expectations. In a downward moving commodity cost environment, our pricing typically becomes more competitive as we benefit from the lag that other REPs experience in reducing their sell rate to reflect the lower commodity costs, and we may benefit from decreases in margin pressure, improvements in the customer acquisition environment, and lower rates of churn. In a rising commodity cost environment, our variable rate products reflect real-time commodity costs, which will typically become less competitive, in the short-term with other REPs, and we may experience increased margin pressure, a more challenging customer acquisition environment and higher rates of customer churn.
 
Genie Japan's products were designed to be the most competitive for higher electricity use customers. Our pricing product offers increasing percentage of savings the more electricity a customer uses, while the pricing structure of other REPs have tiered pricing structure with higher pricing for the higher monthly usage tiers. Increasing our market share depends in part on our ability to find those higher use customers and persuade the pricing advantage of our price product versus the incumbent utility pricing. Other REPs have certain advantages such as name recognition, financial strength and long-standing relationships with customers. Persuading potential customers to switch to Genie Japan requires significant marketing and sales operations.
 
Regulation

REPs such as Genie Japan, must acquire a license from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ("METI"). METI regulates the industry and has one set of regulations and rules that govern the operations of REPs for the entire country.
 
Although the rates charged by REPs are not regulated by the METI in the same way as the rates of utility companies, the manner in which the REPs market to potential customers, and the relationships between the REPs and their customers, are regulated through REP guidelines published by METI. Genie Japan must also comply with various monthly and annual reporting requirements to METI in order to maintain their eligibility to provide service. REPs are also required to collect from end users the Renewable Energy Generation Promotion Levy and remit this to the Green Investment Promotion Organization.

United Kingdom

GRE international holds a 100.0% interest in Shoreditch, which operates Orbit Energy, a REP that operates in the United Kingdom.

The Gas Act of 1986 led to the privatisation of British natural gas market while the Electricity Act of 1989 provided for the privatization of the electricity industry. The residential energy market was opened to competition between 1996 and 1999.
  
Orbit was incorporated in 2015 and is licensed to sell both electricity and natural gas in the United Kingdom. In July 2017, the Company entered into a joint venture in which it held a noncontrolling interest. Orbit started its commercial operations in January 2018. Orbit operates in the mainland United Kingdom, excluding Northern Ireland serving primarily residential customers. Orbit provides customers with a choice of fixed-price contracts, typically ranging in jurisdiction from one to three years, with the majority taking one-year fixed-price contracts. Orbit also provides variable price products to its customer. At December 31, 2020, approximately 40.0% of customers were on a variable price product. A small portion of the Orbit’s customers are on a government mandated price cap.

Marketing
 
 Before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Orbit used a wide range of marketing tools to acquire new customers including door-to-door sales, venue sales, telephone and digital through price comparison engines. Majority of the customers were acquired through the use of third-party marketing and sales companies. During the pandemic, however, Orbit closed down its door-to-door and venue sales operations and relied primarily on telephone marketing. The majority of customers are now acquired through the use of third-party marketing sales companies. Orbit is primarily targeting customers who are on a relatively high tariff with their existing suppliers presenting target customers with potential savings compared to their current suppliers.

Approximately 80.0% of the U.K. market is on credit meters. These customers typically pay on receipt of bill or through a monthly flat direct-debit ("DD") or credit card payment which is set to recover the annual consumptions. The other 20.0% of the customers pay for their energy consumptions using pre-payment meters. These meters are "topped" up using tokens and allow customers to only use what they paid for, thus enabling greater control on consumption.
Orbit is responsible for billing and collecting from its customers directly. Invoices and statements of account are sent on a monthly basis for credit customers and annual statements are delivered for its pre-pay customers. The majority of its customers receive their statements of account on a quarterly basis.

Approximately 90.0% of the credit customers have an active DD or credit card arrangement with Orbit and pay for their annual consumption through flat monthly payments. 

Procurement and Management of Gas and Electricity
 
REPs in the United Kingdom generally have no significant fixed assets and low levels of capital expenditure. Their cost of revenues is incurred to purchase electricity and natural gas in their respective wholesale markets and other factors. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily related to customer acquisition, customer retention, billing, and collections.

Orbit does not own electrical power generation, transmission, or distribution facilities, or natural gas production, pipeline or distribution facilities. 

Orbit Energy has an exclusive contract with Shell U.K. Limited ("Shell") to provide electricity and natural gas to Orbit until June 2024, with an option (not an obligation) to extend through June 2027. Shell provides access to the forward market such that Orbit can enter into a forward hedge for its customers which protects Orbit from mark-to-market fluctuations. Shell also provides extended payment facilities of an additional 30 days compared to the U.K. payment terms up to a limit of £5.0 million at an interest of LIBOR plus 5.0%. Shell charges an additional £0.9 per therm of natural gas and Mwh of electricity for all delivered volume on top of the wholesale costs. The contract with Shell is secured by Orbit's shares. The contract is also subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the maintenance of certain covenants which includes minimum levels of cash, gross margin, net worth, as defined in the contract, earnings before tax, as defined in the contract and provision for bad debts on accounts receivable. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with such covenants.

Orbit has the ability to purchase electricity from other sources through Shell, if lower costs are available.

Orbit currently contracts with the National Grid of United Kingdom and seven distribution companies that deliver electricity to fourteen regions in the United Kingdom.
 
Orbit also contracts with CNG Energy Ltd. to ship the natural gas from injection point to the customers. CNG is primarily an intermediary between Orbit and the gas pipeline companies.
 
Competition
 
GRE competes with other independent energy providers. More than 70.0% of the market is dominated by the “Big 6” energy companies in the United Kingdom with the rest of the market served by small and mid-size energy supplier similar to Orbit.

REPs compete on price, customer service, ease of switching service providers and other ancillary services.
 
Regulation
 
The energy market in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (“OFGEM”). OFGEM is a non-ministerial government department and an independent National Regulatory Authority, recognized by European Union Directives. The OFGEM’s role was originally defined in the privatisation statutes (Gas Act of 1986 and Electricity Act of 1989) but was significantly changed by the Utilities Act of 2000, which gave OFGEM a new primary duty of protecting consumers wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition. One of its key secondary duties is to protect the interests of low-income customers. OFGEM regulates minimum levels of standards and how an energy company communicates with its customers with respect to timing of invoicing, price change communication, information that is provided on invoices, compensation and levels of smart meter installation. OFGEM also set a maximum price that a REP can charge a customer if the customer has not actively chosen a tariff or if they are on a variable tariff. U.K. REPs are required to provide a variety of reports to OFGEM including customer complaints, meter read performance and tariffs by customers to collect data on topics of interest or to check on compliance with the licence conditions. Inspection by OFGEM is done through these reports and monitoring public information like customer feedback on social media. In addition, OFGEM conducts quarterly review with our Orbits account manager. OFGEM also has the power to carry out ad-hoc inspections.
Employees 
 
As of March 5, 2021, GRE International employed 64 employees, 21 of whom are located in Finland, 16 of whom are located in our Japan office and 27 of whom are located in United Kingdom.
Genie Energy Services
 
GES is comprised of businesses that market and provide energy solutions. GES currently consists of  (i) our controlling interest in Prism (ii) Diversegy, and (iii) Genie Solar Energy.
Prism Solar Technologies 
 
The Company acquired a 60.0% controlling interest in Prism in October 2018. On April 12, 2019, Prism restructured its ownership. The Company now holds 60.0% interest in Plus EnerG which owns 100% of Prism. In the second quarter of 2020, Prism renegotiated a contract with a customer which resulted in impairment of customer relationship of $0.8 million included in the consolidated statements of operation. Prism also provided a full impairment of its remaining goodwill of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Prism is a solar solutions company engaged in solar panel manufacturing, solar installation design and project management. In the U.S., Prism’s solar panels are used in residential, office and commercial buildings. Residential applications include solar sunrooms (solariums), skylights, canopies and sun decks. Prism's solar panels are used in the construction of parking canopies, electric vehicle car ports, parking structures, vertically mounted on buildings and many other custom applications.
 
Certain of Prism’s solar panels are designed with high efficiency N-type silicon solar cell technology designed into bifacial solar modules. This technology results in a reduction in the average cost per kilowatt hour. Elements of the technology that Prism uses are protected under patent application. The glass-on-glass design of the solar panels increases the durability and lifetime value of the solar panels. Unlike traditional solar modules, where photo-voltaic (“PV”) cells can only use the sunlight that strikes the front of the module, Prism’s bifacial modules generate energy on both sides, capturing a substantial amount of light scattered from clouds and surrounding surfaces. In traditional modules this additional light is not converted into electricity.  Prism’s solutions are especially valuable when Prism's modules are mounted over highly reflective backgrounds, such as white roof, snow, sand, or other light-colored surfaces.
 
Solar Industry Overview
 
Products and services in this industry consist of silicon modules and cells, thin-film modules and cells and other modules cells. The demand for solar panel manufacturing is impacted by government programs, commodity prices and international trade. 
Solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to and/or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. In recent years, the price of PV solar power systems, and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems, has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. The rapid price decline that PV solar energy has experienced in recent years has opened new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives. Worldwide solar markets continue to develop, aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which make solar power more affordable. 

The solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. In particular, module average selling prices in the United States and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years, and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline globally to some degree in the future. In the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. We believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing. 

Multiple markets within the United States, exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market, including (i) sizeable electricity demand, particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas; (ii) strong demand for renewable energy generation; and (iii) abundant solar resources. In those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced, our PV solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation.

Customers; Marketing

 The services of GES – Diversegy and Prism – are made available to customers via multiple channels and under several offerings.  The majority of our customer base consists of medium to large commercial customers who are looking to be more efficient with their energy consumption.

GES is responsible for sales, manufacturing, project management of the installation, and collection of payment from the customers.

Competition

The market for solar electric power technologies is competitive and continually evolving. In the last year, we faced increased competition, resulting in price reductions in the market and reduced margins, which may continue and could lead to loss of market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to Canadian Solar Inc., Hanwha QCELLS Corporation, JA Solar Holdings Co., Kyocera Corporation, LG Corporation, Jinko Solar, NRG Energy, Inc., Panasonic Corporation, Sharp Corporation, SunRun, Inc., Tesla, Inc., Trina Solar Ltd., Vivint, Inc., LONGi Solar, REC Group, Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. Ltd. and First Solar, Inc.
 
We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our product and service offerings, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. We compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers. 
 
  Research and Development

Prism devotes substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems, adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our products and systems.

The Company measures the effectiveness of our research and development by metrics including product unit cost, efficiency, reliability, power output, and ease of use.
Regulation
 
Federal government support for renewable energy
 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings (where applicable) of foreign subsidiaries; (iii) generally eliminating the U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries; (iv) requiring current inclusion in the U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (v) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and changing how existing AMT credits may be realized; (vi) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), a new minimum tax; (vii) creating a new limitation on the deductible interest expense; and (viii) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
 
The U.S. federal government provides an uncapped investment tax credit, or “Federal ITC,” that allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a residential or commercial solar generation facility. The Tax Act did not make any changes to the existing laws surrounding tax credits for renewable energy. The Federal ITC is currently scheduled to be reduced to 26% for solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2020 and to 22% for solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2021. A permanent 10% Federal ITC is available for non-residential solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2022.
 
U.S. state government support for renewable energy
 
Many states offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for renewable energy facilities, which is additive to the Federal ITC. Further, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy facilities that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Certain of our renewable energy facilities in the U.S. have been financed with a tax equity financing structure, whereby the tax equity investor is a member holding equity in the limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns the solar generation facility or wind power plant and receives the benefits of various tax credits.
 
Many state governments, utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a renewable energy facility for energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s renewable energy facility. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their renewable energy facility during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Some states also have established FIT programs that are a type of performance-based incentive where the system owner-producer is paid a set rate for the electricity their system generates over a set period of time.
 
There are 40 states that have a regulatory policy known as net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar generation facilities to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar generation facility in excess of electric load that is exported to the grid. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed. Some states require utilities to provide net metering to their customers until the total generating capacity of net metered systems exceeds a set percentage of the utilities’ aggregate customer peak demand.
 
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. There are 29 states that have adopted a renewable portfolio standard (“RPS”) that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power generation facilities, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities must procure and retire RECs. System owners often are able to sell RECs to utilities directly or in REC markets.
 
RPS programs and targets have been one of the key drivers of the expansion of solar and wind power and are expected to continue to contribute to solar and wind power installations in many areas of the United States. In addition to the 29 states with RPS programs, eight other states have non-binding goals supporting renewable energy. 

Diversegy 

Diversegy is a commercial energy advisory firm helping clients to reduce costs, mitigate risk, and improve their bottom lines through the development and implementation of energy utilization and sourcing strategies. Diversegy works with customers to lower their energy supply costs, reduce their consumption with LED upfitting and other means, as well as provide on- and off-site generation with solar.
In 2020, Diversegy accounted for 0.5% and 7.7% of the Company’s consolidated revenue and GES segment's revenue, respectively. Diversegy operates as an energy broker and advisor to industrial, commercial and municipal across deregulated energy markets in the U.S. Most of our customers are enrolled in multi-year contracts that have a fixed rate with our partner suppliers. The supplier is fully responsible for risk management, billing and collections. Diversegy receives commissions from the supplier for the referral either as an upfront payments or as a residual over the life of the customers' contract.

Diversegy markets its services though an in-house sales force as well as independent third-party brokers.
 Genie Solar Energy 

Genie Solar Energy is a sales and general contracting organization. Genie Solar Energy sells rooftop solar system to commercial and industrial clients who benefit by either lower consumption, lower cost of energy and by accruing financial benefits from their respective states and the U.S government for investing in renewable energy. Genie Solar Energy acquires the customers, manages the procurement of materials and labor involved in installing the solar system and arranges for third party financing when the customer requires it.
