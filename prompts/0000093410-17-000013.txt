Summary Description of Chevron 
Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. 
A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-5. As of December 31, 2016, Chevron had approximately 55,200 employees (including about 3,200 service station employees). Approximately 26,500 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 48 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. 
Overview of Petroleum Industry 
Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies, in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets.

Delivery Commitments
The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. 
In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 140 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2017 through 2019. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. 
6

Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 1,913 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2017 through 2019 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.
Development Activities

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas 
Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2016 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-6, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-11. 
The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the company’s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. 
United States
Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2016 averaged 691,000 barrels per day. 
The company's activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. During 2016, net daily production in these areas averaged 123,000 barrels of crude oil, 576 million cubic feet of natural gas and 40,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2016, the company divested properties in areas including Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. The company is pursuing selected opportunities for divestment of additional properties in 2017.
In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,000,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. The stacked plays multiply the basin’s resource and economic potential by allowing for multiple horizontal wells to be developed from a single pad location using shared facilities and infrastructure, which reduces development costs and improves capital efficiency. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill multiple horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using multistage hydraulic fracture stimulation. The company drilled 93 wells and participated in 108 nonoperated wells in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2016.
During 2016, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 158,000 barrels of crude oil, 183 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of NGLs. The company divested selected shelf properties in 2016 and is pursuing divestment of additional shelf assets in 2017. Chevron is also engaged in various exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 
The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields in 2016 averaged 94,000 barrels of liquids (47,000 net) and 14 million cubic feet of natural gas (7 million net). Production ramp-up and development drilling for the first development phase continued in 2016. In addition, work continued on Stage 2, the second phase of the development plan, which includes four additional development wells, two each at the Jack and St. Malo fields. Start-up of the first Stage 2 development well was achieved in third quarter 2016. Development drilling is planned to continue in 2017. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 128,000 barrels of crude oil and 33 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years.
At the 58 percent-owned and operated deepwater Tahiti Field, net daily production averaged 31,000 barrels of crude oil, 13 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 2,000 barrels of NGLs. Four infill production wells were completed in 2016. The next development phase, the Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project, achieved a final investment decision in mid-2016. The expansion project includes four new wells and associated subsea infrastructure. The four wells have been drilled and cased, and completion operations are underway. First oil is expected in 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The Tahiti Field has an estimated remaining production life of at least 20 years.
The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. In 2016, net daily production averaged 8,000 barrels of liquids and 1 million cubic feet of natural gas. The next development phase, the Mad Dog 2 Project, is planned to develop the southern portion of the Mad Dog Field. The development plan includes a new floating production platform with a design capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. A final investment decision was reached in February 2017. First oil is expected in 2021. At the end of 2016, proved reserves had not been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project.

The development plan for the 60 percent-owned and operated deepwater Big Foot Project includes a 15-slot drilling and production tension leg platform with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Fabrication of replacement mooring tendons began in mid-2016. Platform installation is expected to resume in late 2017, with first oil expected in late 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 35 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.
Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project, the unitized development of the deepwater Knotty Head and Pony discoveries. The planned facilities have a design capacity of 80,000 barrels of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Fabrication and development drilling activities progressed in 2016, with first oil expected in 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project.
During 2016 and early 2017, the company participated in five appraisal wells and four exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
