ITEM 1: BUSINESS
 
Red Metal Resources Ltd. was incorporated under the Nevada Business Corporations Act on January 10, 2005, as Red Lake Exploration, Inc. On August 27, 2008, the name of the Company was changed to Red Metal Resources Ltd. In addition to the name change, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation were amended to increase the amount of the total authorized capital stock of the Company from 75,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001 designated as Common Stock to 500,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001.
 
On February 10, 2021, the Company changed its corporate jurisdiction from the State of Nevada to the Province of British Columbia by means of a process called a “conversion” under the Nevada Revised Statutes and a “continuation” under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, under the Nevada Revised Statutes, were replaced with the Articles of the Company, under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), upon the Company’s continuation to British Columbia. The authorized capital of the Company was amended to an unlimited number of common shares without par value.
 
The Company’s head office is located at 278 Bay Street, Suite 102, Thunder Bay, Ontario, P7B 1R8. The Company’s registered office address is 700 – 595 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V7X 1S8.
 
On August 21, 2007, the Company formed Minera Polymet Limitada (“Polymet”) as a limited liability company, under the laws of the Republic of Chile. On September 28, 2015, the Company changed Polymet’s incorporation from Limited Liability Company to a Closed Stock Corporation (“SpA”). As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K the Company owns 100% of Polymet, which holds its Chilean mineral property interests.
General
 
The Company is engaged in the business of mineral exploration in Chile with the objective to explore and, if warranted, develop mineral properties. All of the Company’s mineral claims are located in the Candelaria iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) belt of the coastal cordillera, in the Carrizal Alto Mining District, III Region of Atacama, Chile. The Company has three active copper-gold projects on two properties, namely the Farellón and Perth Projects both located on the Carrizal Property, and the Mateo Project located on the Mateo Property. In addition to holding these active properties, as an exploration company, the Company periodically stakes, purchases or options claims to allow time and access to fully consider the geological potential of claims.
 
The Company’s flagship project, the Farellón Project, is a mid-stage exploration project consisting of eight mining concessions totaling 1,234 hectares.
 
The Company acquired the initial mining claim for the Farellón Project pursuant to an assignment agreement between Polymet and Minera Farellón Limitada (“Minera Farellón”) dated September 25, 2007, and amended on November 20, 2007. Under the terms of the assignment agreement, Minera Farellón agreed to assign to Polymet its option to buy the Farellón 1 al 8 mining concession. Polymet acquired the option on April 25, 2008, and concurrently assumed all of Minera Farellón’s rights and obligations under the Farellón option agreement. Polymet exercised the option and bought the property from the vendor on April 25, 2008. The patented mining concessions are registered in the name of and owned 100% by Polymet.
 
On September 17, 2008, the Company acquired the Cecil 1 - 49, Cecil 1 - 40 and Burghley 1 - 60 claims for an aggregate purchase price of $27,676. On December 1, 2009, the Company initiated the manifestacion process by applying to convert the Cecil 1 - 40 and Burghley 1 - 60 exploration (pedimento) claims to mining (mensura) claims. In January 2013 the Company abandoned the manifestacion process for the Cecil 1-40 and Burghley 1-60 claims as the Company discovered that the most prospective ground, as outlined in the Company’s prospecting and mapping program completed in April 2012, was covered by several mensuras underlying both claims.
 
On August 21, 2012, the Company acquired four mineral claims - Azucar 6-25, Kahuna 1-40, Stamford 61-101, and Teresita - through the government auction for a total price of $19,784.
 
On December 15, 2014, the Company entered into an option agreement with David Marcus Mitchell to earn 100% interest in a Quina 1-56 clam (the “Quina Claim”). The Quina Claim covers 251 hectares and is centered at 310,063 east and 6,890,435 south UTM PSAD56 Zone 19 and is contiguous to the Farellón Property. Acquisition of the Quina Claim added approximately 2 kilometers of strike length of the Farellón veins. In order to acquire the 100% interest in the Quina Claim the Company paid a total of $150,000 in combined stock and cash payments and completed the acquisition on December 15, 2018.

On June 3, 2015, the Company entered into an option agreement, made effective on June 15, 2015, with Minera Stamford S.A., to earn 100% interest in a mining claim known as “Exeter 1-54” (the “Exeter claim”). The Exeter claim totals 235 hectares and is contiguous to the Farellón Property, which is located in the Carrizal Alto mining district, located approximately 75 kilometers northwest of the city of Vallenar, 150 kilometers south of Copiapo and 20 kilometers west of the Pan American Highway. In order to acquire 100% interest in the Exeter claim, the Company paid a total of $150,000 and completed the transaction on May 12, 2019.
 
The Company’s Perth and Mateo Projects are both early-stage exploration projects. The Perth Project is composed of 13 mining concessions covering 2,044 hectares and the Mateo Project is composed of 5 mining concessions covering 182 hectares. Both projects are 100% owned by Polymet.
 
These properties form substantial land holdings in a historical mining district, which was a prolific past producer, shut down due to economic conditions, rather than exhaustion of deposits. The Company’s Carrizal Property, adjacent and contiguous to the Carrizal Alto Mine, has undergone only limited modern exploration, which has so far demonstrated the potential of the property to host a mineralized deposit.
 
To date the Company has not determined whether its claims contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable, and it has not produced revenues from its principal business.
 
Chile’s mining and land tenure policies
 
Chile’s current mining and land tenure policies were incorporated into laws in 1982 and amended in 1983. The laws were established to secure the property rights of both domestic and foreign investors to stimulate mining development in Chile. While the state owns all mineral resources, exploration and exploitation of these resources is permitted by acquiring mining concessions which are granted by the courts according to the law.
 
Concessions are defined by UTM coordinates representing the centre-point of the concession and dimensions (in metres) in north-south and east-west directions. There are two kinds of concessions, mining and exploration, and three possible stages of a concession to get from an exploration concession to a mining concession: ‘pedimento’, ‘manifestacion’, and ‘mensura’ (see below for descriptions). An exploration concession (‘pedimento’) can be placed on any area, whereas the survey to establish a permanent exploitation concession (‘mensura’) can only be effected on “free” areas where no other mensuras exist.
 
Pedimento
 
A pedimento is an initial exploration concession with well-defined UTM coordinates delineating the north-south and east-west boundaries. The minimum size of a pedimento is 100ha and the maximum is 5,000ha, with a maximum length-to-width ratio of 5:1. A pedimento is valid for a maximum period of two years. At the end of the two-year period it can either be reduced in size by at least 50% and renewed for an additional two years or, entered into the process to establish a permanent concession by converting it into a manifestacion. New pedimentos are allowed to overlap pre-existing pedimentos, however, the pedimento with the earliest filing date always takes precedence providing the concession holder maintains their concession in accordance with the Mining Code of Chile and the applicable regulations.
Manifestacion
 
Before a pedimento expires, or at any stage during its two-year life (including the first day the pedimento is registered), it may be converted to a manifestacion. A manifestacion is valid for 220 days, and then prior to the expiry date, the owner must request an upgrade to a mensura.
Mensura
 
Prior to the expiration of a manifestacion, the owner must request a survey (mensura). After acceptance of the survey request (‘Solicitud de Mensura’), the owner has approximately 12 months to have the concession surveyed by a government licensed surveyor. The surrounding concession owners may witness the survey, which is subsequently described in a legal format and presented to the National Mining Service of Chile (Sernageomin) for technical review, which includes field inspection and verification. Following the technical approval by Sernageomin, the file returns to a judge of the appropriate jurisdiction, who dictates the constitution of the claim as a mensura. Once constituted, an abstract describing the claim is published in Chile’s official mining bulletin (published weekly), and 30 days later the claim can be inscribed in the appropriate Mining Registry (Conservador de Minas).

-


Once constituted, a mensura is a permanent property right, with no expiration date. As long as the annual fees (‘patentes’) are paid in a timely manner (from March to May of each year), clear title and ownership of the mineral rights is assured in perpetuity. Failure to pay the annual patentes for an extended period can result in the concession being listed for ‘remate’ (auction sale), wherein a third party may acquire a concession for the payment of back taxes owed (plus a penalty payment). In such a case, the claim is included in a list published 30 days prior to the auction and the owner has the possibility of paying the back taxes plus penalty and thus removing the claim from the auction list.
 
Due to the complicated nature of the land tenure system in Chile, Red Metal has engaged a land tenure specialist who sends a monthly report on the status of all claims in the areas the Company is working in. This report includes a list of any new concessions in our area and any obligation on the Company’s part to notify new concession holders of its existing concessions.
 
Unproved mineral properties
 
Due to a lack of operating capital, during the past two fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company conducted no material exploratory operations on any of its properties. Until the Company is able to raise operating capital, which the Company cannot assure that it can do, the Company will not be able to initiate new exploration efforts or continue the exploration efforts it has begun. In the past the Company entered into several various agreements, being the joint ventures or the option agreements to acquire an interest in its claims. These agreements give the Company confidence there are opportunities to raise funds by selling some of its properties or by entering into joint venture agreements to continue developing some of its properties.
 
Active properties
 
Through a number of transactions since 2007, the Company has assembled its active mineral properties identified and further detailed in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively, below as the Farellón Property, the Perth Property, and the Mateo Property:

Carrizal Property – Farellón And Perth Projects
 
Property Description and Location
 
The Carrizal Property is located approximately 700 km north of Chile’s capital city of Santiago, in Region III, referred to as the “Region de Atacama”. The Carrizal Property lies within the Carrizal Alto Mining District, straddling the border between Huasco and Copiapo provinces, approximately 75 km northwest of the City of Vallenar, 150 km south of Copiapo, and 20 km west of the Pan-American Highway. The centre of the Carrizal Property is situated at coordinates 308750 mE and 6895000 mN (PSAD56 UTM Zone 19, Southern Hemisphere).
 
The Carrizal Property has historically been subdivided into two separate projects, namely the Perth and Farellón project areas, representing roughly the northern and southern halves of the Carrizal Property, respectively. The Carrizal Property consists of 21 mining concessions (“mensuras”). The Carrizal Property covers a total area of 3,278 hectares (2,044 ha in the Perth Project and 1,234 ha in the Farellón Project) (Figures 2, 3 & 4).

Accessibility
 
The Carrizal Property is readily accessible from the City of Vallenar, Chile, via both paved and well-maintained dirt roads. Access is primarily gained by taking the Pan-American highway (Ruta 5) north from Vallenar to the Carrizal turn-off (approximately 20 km north). From the turn-off, a well-maintained dirt road runs to the CMP Cerro Colorado iron mine and continues to Canto del Agua and towards Carrizal Alto. From this route, a dirt side road then leads directly to the Carrizal Property (Figure 1).
 
Title/Interest
 
The Company owns all of the concessions in the Carrizal Property, through right of title.
 
Surface Rights and Legal Access
 
The surface rights of the Carrizal Property are owned by the Chilean government; however, if the Carrizal Property is developed and mined at a later date, the surface rights will need to be secured as part of the permitting process. Surface rights are rented to mines for the life of the mine by the Chilean government and claim holders have legal unimpeded access to their pedimentos and mensuras.

Other Land Tenure Agreements
 
There are pre-existing Net Smelter Return Royalties (“NSR”) on the properties as outlined in Table 2 below and there are no other known land tenure agreements regarding the Carrizal Property. To date, all mining concessions that comprise the Carrizal Property have been surveyed by the Chilean government.

Exploration Plans and Permits
 
The Company holds an approved permit to mine up to 5,000 tonnes per month. This permit does not allow for processing to occur on site, but ore can be excavated up to 5,000 tonnes per month and delivered to an independent processor.
Exploration History
 
Introduction and Regional History
 
Mining has played an important role in Chile’s economy starting in the 16th century with gold, silver and copper being mined from high grade deposits. Copper mining, in particular, has employed a significant portion of the population both directly and indirectly over the last 100 years. Historically, the most significant mineral producing zone in Chile has been the Coastal Cordillera, ranging between 50 and 100 km wide, extending over 2,500 km from Valparaiso in the south, northward to the Peruvian boarder.
 
The Carrizal Alto Mine area is located within this prolific Coastal Cordilleran range, in the Atacama III Region of northern Chile, between Copiapo and Vallenar. Historical records indicate that copper mining commenced at Carrizal Alto in the 1820s and continued on a significant scale mostly by British companies until 1891, when disastrous flooding occurred and mines closed. The historical reports indicate that the larger mines were obtaining good grades over significant widths in the bottom workings at the time of closure. Very little information regarding mining has survived, but there is a small amount of historical data located in the SERNAGEOMIN National Archives in Santiago, Chile. Up until 1891, mining at the Carrizal Alto Mine site produced over 3 million tonnes of Cu ore, grading between 5 and 15% copper (National Archives in Santiago, Chile). There was also a large quantity of direct shipping ore at 12% copper. At one time there was a considerable body of tailings present to support these figures, however this material has been reprocessed and depleted due to the high prices of gold and copper over the last few years.
 
The Carrizal Alto Mine area contains a series of northeast-trending shear structures, including the principal vein systems of ‘Mina Grande’ and ‘Armonia’. Both vein systems have been worked extensively. The Mina Grande shear contains workings that extend for over 2.5 km as a nearly continuous line of pits, collapsed stopes, narrow open cuts and numerous shafts. The Armonia vein system is similar, extending for 1.8 km. Oxidation depths range from 50 to 150 m, and judging from remnant material, many of the veins were probably worked to this depth and then abandoned as sulfide mineralization was reached.
 
In the most productive zone at Mina Grande (which stretches for 1.5 km), the mineralized vein reached 15 m in width and is composed of quartz, sericite, chalcopyrite and pyrite. Amphibole-rich seams occur proximal to the diorite wall rock, which also frequently contains chalcopyrite and pyrite-bearing impregnations and smaller veins. The main producing mine in the Carrizal Alto Mine area was the Veta Principal on the Mina Grande shear, which was mined to a depth of 400 m along a strike of 1.8 km and over a width varying from 2-15 m. The deepest workings reached 600 m. Several slag dumps remain at old sites of local smelters treating the sulfide ores. Carrizal Alto, despite spectacular past production from the Capote, Mina Grande, and Armonia mines, has remained virtually untouched since the brief gold revival of the 1930s.
 
The current Carrizal Property is comprised of two contiguous blocks, namely the Farellón to the south and Perth to the north (Figure 2). Both of these blocks border the historically-productive Carrizal Alto Mine to the east, sharing geological and mineralogical attributes, and for consistency, the historical names have been retained.
 
Farellón Project Area
 
The Farellón block of concessions, which are contiguous with the Carrizal Alto Mine area, was mined on a limited basis in the 1940s. Very little information remains from this time period, except for a few plans of the limited underground mining (SERNAGEOMIN National Archives, Santiago, Chile).
 
In 1963, eight samples were taken from two high grade veins from the accessible workings within the Farellón project area, namely Veta Pique and Veta Naciente. These samples were analyzed for copper, gold, silver, and gangue oxides (Table 3). Unfortunately, no units of measure were provided in the 1963 report accompanying the assay grades, although wt% is most likely for copper. In conjunction with historic records from the 1940s, this information was incorporated into a mineral resource estimate (see below).

In the 2010 Technical Report by Micon on the Company’s Farellón Property (which corresponds roughly to the current Farellón Project area), the author stated that “no attempt was made to verify the sampling program of 1963, as the workings were not entirely accessible and there is no sample location map upon which to attempt to duplicate the samples” (Lewis, 2010).

Oliver Resources, an Irish-based company, through its Chilean subsidiary Oliver Resources Chile Ltda., briefly explored the Farellón Property in 1990 with a stream sediment sampling program and sampling of the Farellón Alto and Bajo mine dumps.
 
The Farellón Property was incorporated into a larger land package called the Azucar Project in the 1990s, owned by Minera Stamford S.A. (Minera Stamford), a Chilean exploration company. In a joint venture with Metalsearch, an Australian company, exploration on these concessions included geological mapping, rock chip sampling, soil geochemistry, reverse circulation (RC) drilling and metallurgical sampling. Geological mapping of the Azucar project showed a NE-trending sheared contact 50 to 200 m wide, containing significant consistent mineralization along a 2 km strike length. Minera Stamford collected 152 rock chip and dump samples from prospective areas along the mineralized shear zone, of which 36 samples fell within the boundary of the Farellón Project. Samples were analyzed for gold, copper and cobalt. The highest gold sample within the Farellón Property was 13.50 g/t Au, the highest copper result was 6.15% Cu, and the highest cobalt result was 0.68% Co. A total of 591 soil samples were also taken by Minera Stamford, but no records of this work have been located.
 
A reverse circulation drilling program of 33 holes totaling 6 486 m was completed between 1996 and 1997 targeting the shear zone on the Azucar property by the JV between Minera Stamford and Metalsearch. Twenty-two (22) of these holes were located within the Farellón Project area, representing a total of 3918 m. Drill holes were placed at irregular intervals along the mineralized shear zone, and the holes were sampled at regular 1 m intervals along their entire length. Results of this drill campaign confirmed the consistent presence of mineralization in the shear zone, to a vertical depth of ~200 m. As shown in Table 4, the highest gold concentration was 21.03 g/t Au, the highest copper result was 9.21% Cu, and the highest cobalt result was 0.58% Co (all of these results are over 1 m intervals).

The historic Farellón workings are in metamorphic units within the sheared metamorphic/tonalite contact zone which is about 200m wide. The workings are large but restricted to the oxide zone and range from 1-20 m wide. A sample of the wall rock and quartz veined metamorphic rocks taken by Minera Stamford returned 3.0% copper, 1.4 g/t gold, 0.08% cobalt, and 1.1% arsenic.

The lower Farellón workings are several hundred metres to the south and associated with massive siderite. A sample collected by Minera Stamford of the lode material returned 5.6% copper, 2.4 g/t gold, 0.02% cobalt. A 20 ton trial parcel of material from the Farellón workings in the 1950s is reported to have returned over 1% cobalt.
 
The Company acquired the rights to the Farellón Property on April 25, 2008, upon its Chilean subsidiary exercising the option to buy the property from Minera Farellón. The Company drilled five RC drill holes in 2009, totaling 725m using a Tramrock Dx40 RC rig. This larger rig necessitated widening existing roads rehabilitating access to old drill pads. The drill program was designed to twin some of the Minera Stamford 1996-1997 drill holes for data verification, as no geological information was recovered from the Minera Stamford drill program and assays were not accompanied by laboratory certificates. One drill hole tested 100 m below the known mineralization, and another hole tested continuity of mineralization between previously drilled sections.
 
Collar locations and azimuths for the 2009 drilling were surveyed using a total station surveying tool. Each drill hole had 1.5 m of blue PVC piping added to it as a surface pre-collar which was cemented into place to permanently denote the drill hole location. Downhole surveys were completed on all drill holes from the 2009 program and on six drill holes from the 1996-1997 Minera Stamford program (holes 9, 14, 20, 21, 22, and 23). Surveying of all historic drill holes surrounding the current drilling was attempted, but some of the holes were caved and the survey tool was unable to be lowered into the hole.

Results from the 2009 drilling confirmed the general location and tenor of the mineralization determined during the 1996-1997 Minera Stamford drilling program, however, the 2009 program was not able to reproduce the historical gold assays within holes FAR-09-A and FAR-09-E, designed to duplicate historical holes FAR-96-22 and FAR-96-21, respectively. In the case of FAR-09-E, the disparity between the historical 1996-1997 and 2009 assays was also found with respect to copper. All drill holes during the 2009 drilling program intersected oxide facies mineralization with only minor amounts of sulfide (e.g. hole FAR-09-D).

In 2011, the Company completed a second drilling program, consisting of nine reverse circulation holes and two combined RC/diamond drill (core) holes. Chips and core recovered consisted of 2050 m of RC drilled, and 183 m of diamond (core), for a total of 2233 m. The program was designed to expand the known mineralized zone down-dip to 200 m vertical depth, extend the known mineralized strike length of the overall deposit to 700 m, and infill large gaps with holes drilled at 75 m spacing. Two of the drill holes finished with diamond drill core, providing information to better define the structural controls on mineralization.
 
Collar locations and azimuths for the 2011 drilling were surveyed using a handheld GPS. The Company used a magnetic REFLEX EZ-TRAC instrument to complete downhole surveys using a digital remote gyroscope. Downhole surveys were completed on all 11 drill holes from the 2011 program every 50-100 m downhole so most drill holes had at least three readings taken along with the one at the surface. Due to the high magnetic susceptibility of the subsurface, the azimuth reading and the magnetic readout gave inaccurate readouts. Therefore, only the downhole dip could be recorded with any level of confidence. The significant assays are reported as core lengths as the true width of the mineralized zone was not established.

Drilling returned copper results as high as 8.86% Cu, with 0.80 g/t Au over 1 m (FA-11-001), and 5.35 g/t Au, 4.77% Cu, and 0.024% Co over a 2 m interval (FA-11-006). There was evidence of pinching and swelling in the mineralized vein structures, as significant intercepts ranging in width from 2 m to 32 m. Ten of the eleven drill holes contained significant intercepts (9). Drill hole FA-11-002 did not intercept the interpreted mineralized zone, likely due to a misinterpretation of localized fault off-set of the mineralized vein. Select drill hole sections from the 2011 drilling program are presented in Figures 5 through 10, all taken from Lewis (2012).

All significant intercepts from the 2011 drilling program were dominated by supergene oxide mineralization from surface to ~150 m depth. Sulfide mineralization was minimal within this shallow depth range, becoming more abundant as the transition to the hypogene zone approached below ~150 m depth. This transition zone was highly variable depending on faulting, groundwater flow pathways, and variable elevation. Below 150 m, hypogene conditions dominated, resulting in abundant sulfide mineralization, as seen in drill holes FA-11-003 (177-182 m), FA-11-009 (202-211.55 m), and FA-11-010 (179.13-183 m). Supergene mineralization was dominated by malachite, chrysocolla, and copper±gold within goethite and limonite iron oxides. Alteration haloes were associated with supergene mineralization such as carbonate, limonite, hematite, goethite, and manganese oxide. Other alteration minerals were present, such as chlorite, epidote, actinolite, biotite, and sericite, however these minerals were not related to the supergene mineralization.
 
Hypogene mineralization was dominated by chalcopyrite with associated gold. Chalcopyrite occurred as amorphous blebs and lesser disseminations hosted in massive, sometimes vuggy quartz and calcite. A good example was found in drill core from hole FA-11-009 within the mineralized intersection between 202 m and 211.55 m. The mineralized intersections broadly occur along the regional lithological boundary shear zone between overlying Paleozoic metasediments to the west and underlying Jurassic intrusives to the east.
 
Most of the 2011 drill holes did not pass through the lithological boundaries, even after drilling through the mineralized structures. Therefore, it was interpreted that this mineralization occurs in close proximity to the lithological boundaries, but that the mineralized structures do not exactly follow the contact but instead occur as splays and faults emanating off the major structural boundary.
 
The 2011 drilling results confirmed that mineralization is still present down-dip of the intersections identified during the previous drilling campaign and are still open at depth. The infill drilling confirmed that the mineralization had significant grades and initiated the process of outlining a consistent 75 m spacing between drill holes. The 2011 drilling results also indicated that the significant grades for the copper and gold mineralization were still open along strike to the northeast and southwest, as demonstrated by hole FA-11-001, which was drilled towards the northwest. All drill holes during the 2011 drilling program intersected oxide facies mineralization with the only significant intercepts bearing sulfides in holes FA-11-003 and FA-11-009. The supergene-hypogene transition occurred anywhere between 50 m and 150 m and appeared to be dependent on local fracturing and faulting.
 
A mapping and sampling program was conducted on the Farellón Property in 2012, covering the contact zone between the metasediments and the diorite. The main focus of this program was to ascertain the nature of the veins occurring within each major rock type, and to determine whether any major differences existed in vein structure, mineralogy, alteration, size, and geochemical composition. Over 1,270 mapping sites were visited, with information such as major rock type and mineralization recorded. Of these sites, 56 samples were selected and submitted for geochemical analysis. The range of total copper achieved by this sampling program was between 1.17 and 5.78 % Cu, with between 50 and 99% of that representing copper sulfide mineralization. These samples also contained from 19-2465 ppm Co, and from 0.02-2.87 g/t Au.
 
Two diamond drill holes were completed in 2013 by Perfoandes on behalf of Red Metal totaling 116 m (45 m in the first hole, 71 m in the second). The first hole (F13-001) was located 28 m north of FAR-11-001 on a 45° bearing. Drill core was selectively sampled (16 m sampled from FAR-13-001 and 15 m sampled from FAR-13-002), and analyzed for Au, total Cu and soluble Cu. A significant intersection was encountered in each drill hole, returning 0.7 % Cu and 0.2 g/t Au over 6 m. The second hole recorded 1.75% Cu and 0.25 g/t Au over 9 m. These results confirmed similar findings from FAR-11-001, which was collared 28 m to the south. Both holes recorded the change in mineralogy from dominantly ankerite and other carbonates to more quartz-dominant, containing pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralization.
 
In 2014, the Company entered into a contract with a Chilean artisanal miner allowing the artisanal miner to extract mineralized material on the Farellón property in return for a 10% net sales royalty. In January 2015, the artisanal miner began selling mineralized material to ENAMI, the Chilean national mining company. To date approximately 11,265 tonnes of sulfide-mineralized material with an average grade of 1.67% Cu, 5.8 g/t Ag and 0.21 g/t Au, as well as 1813 tonnes of oxide mineralized material with an average grade of 1.56% Cu has been sold to ENAMI. The ENAMI processing facility currently does not have the capability of recovering cobalt and therefore the artisanal miner did not regularly analyze for cobalt. Three grab samples taken from the same location as the mined mineralized material (Level 7 - 70 m level), were analyzed for gold, copper, and cobalt, with results shown below in Table 10.

The Kahuna concession (part of the Farellón Project area) was historically held by Vector Mining, a private company, and optioned to Catalina Resources PLC (Catalina), a private UK registered mineral exploration company. Catalina conducted a geophysical exploration program in order to determine whether the mineralized structures to the northeast, exploited in the Carrizal Alto mine, extended into the Kahuna area, to determine whether any such structures were associated with possible sulfide mineralization, and to define drill targets for a subsequent phase of work. The survey area was traversed in detail and a geological map was prepared showing all the different lithologies and previous mine workings. Two target areas were defined; one within the diorite intrusive hosting the high-grade mineralization at the old Carrizal Alto mine, the other in the surrounding metamorphic sediments. Two ground geophysical surveys (induced polarization (IP) and magnetometry) were completed May 2007, confirming the continuity of the mineral-bearing structures between Carrizal Alto and the Kahuna area, allowing for the definition of sites for follow-up drilling.
 
The ground magnetic survey was completed on a grid measuring 1.2 km by 3.2 km. A total of 70 km were surveyed on lines spaced 50 m apart. In the IP survey a total of 27 km of data were acquired with a gradient array. Three one km lines were surveyed in a more detailed follow-up survey with a multi-array consisting of both pole-dipole and multi-bipole gradient array. The principal orientation of the shear zones was confirmed to be to the northeast towards Carrizal Alto where similar structures were exploited previously for copper and cobalt. However, there are also several trends to the northwest interpreted to be fault zones that offset the mineralized shear zones slightly. A north-south trend is probably due to dykes. A strong IP anomaly was located in the western portion of the survey area. The IP anomaly correlated with a shallow strongly conductive zone known to be associated with mineralization developed on the margin of the intrusive and exposed in shallow workings. Despite positive results warranting further attention, Catalina eventually dropped the option to the Kahuna Property, and it returned to Vector Mining.
 
Perth Project Area
 
The northern concessions of the Carrizal Property have historically been called the Perth Project. There are numerous artisanal workings throughout this section of the Carrizal Property. The Puenta Negra Mine area contains the Argentina and Dos Amigos veins, with the most significant workings on the property occurring at the Argentina shaft. Unfortunately, no historic mining records have been located for the Argentina and Dos Amigos veins.
 
In the 1990s the Cachina Grande area of the Carrizal Alto received some attention. The Cachina Grande area is underlain by Paleozoic metasediments to the west of the dioritic-hosted Carrizal Alto. In 1991, seven samples from the Cachina Grande area were taken for the report on the Carrizal Alto mining district by Oliver Resources (Ulriksen, 1991). Samples were taken from the Argentina old workings vein 1.8 m, resulting in a range of Cu between 1.76 and 3.4% Cu, and between 0.05 and 1.22 g/t Au. Samples taken from the Dos Amigos North dump were grab samples and ranged between 0.46 and 0.83% Cu, and between 1.29 and 3.41 g/t Au.
 
Appleton Resources Ltd. optioned the Perth Property in 2007 and completed a surface sampling program covering 12 veins identified on the southern portion of the project area, as part of a NI 43-101-compliant report on their Perth Caliza Property (which includes the southern portion of the current Perth project area) (Butrenchuk, 2008). Significant results from the 56-sample program by Appleton Resources in 2007 include total copper between 0.01 and 11.4% Cu, and between 0.01 and 10.7 g/t Au and up to 0.186% Co.
 
In 2011, the Company conducted another sampling program, collecting 129 samples from its Perth Property, and analyzing for total copper, soluble copper, gold, and cobalt. Results included total copper ranging between 0.01 to 11.36% Cu, gold ranging between 0.01 to 29.93 g/t Au, and cobalt ranging between 2 to 6933 ppm.
 
In 2013 and 2014, the Company optioned the Perth Project area to Minera Activa, a Chilean private mining company. Minera Activa conducted a surface sampling, stripping and channel sampling program followed by a two-phase drilling program within the Perth Project area. The surface sampling and stripping program consisted of collecting 762 samples, a combination of grab and chip samples, and analyzing them for total copper, soluble copper, gold, and cobalt. Results are included a range of copper total results between 0.001 and 7.16% Cu, between 0.005 and 16.5g/t Au, and between 0.001 and 0.437% Co. Minera Activa drilled 30 diamond drill holes on the Perth Project area, of these 30 holes, only three were entirely on the Red Metal mineral concessions, the remainder targeted a vein that is exposed at surface on a claim owned by another company that runs through the middle of Red Metal’s Perth Project area. Of these three drill holes only one, DP-04, intersected any significant mineralization; 1 m grading 2.15 gt Au, 1.32% Cu and 0.017% Co.

Historical Resource Estimates and Production
 
There are no formal historical resource estimates on the Farellón project. However, a number of old memo-style reports were put together by the provincial engineer for Atacama particularly in 1963. The sources for the 1963 report were other reports dated from 1942 to 1949. In the report it was noted that the deposit consisted of 3 veins in metamorphic rocks and that blocks of material approximately 50 m in length and depth had been extracted. The historical estimates do not conform to the presently accepted CIM standards and definitions, for resource estimates, as required by NI 43-101 regulations.
 
The 1963 report contained a number of tables which indicated the reserves reported in the previous 1949 report by Ing. Herbert Hornkohl. There are a number of inaccuracies in the tables contained in the 1963 report, most likely related to typing errors, and Micon has attempted to correct these errors by comparing them to the 1949 tables, where applicable. The tables from the reports are reproduced below but not all of the units of measurement were provided for the tabulated grades in the reports. Therefore, Micon has not assigned units of measurement to any grades which are not specified in the reports. After the 1949 study was conducted, the mine was worked and at 1963 there was no visible mineralization (positive ore). There were 500 tons of waste and 1,320 tons of extracted material with the following grades.

Derived from the 1949 and 1963 reports in the Sernageomin files, Chile.
 
The May 2000 Minera Stamford report mentions a resource estimate but this is a conceptual resource estimate based on a minimal amount of information. However, Micon has reviewed this conceptual estimate and concluded that it would not meet the criteria necessary for its inclusion in an NI 43-101 report. Therefore, the Company should not rely on it as justification for a program of compilation work and further exploration. Further work is required to locate and evaluate the true extent and nature of the mineralization on the Farellón Project.
 
As mentioned previously a small amount of historical production has occurred on the Farellón Property primarily during the 1940s. However, there are few existing records of the production and there appear to be some discrepancies in the potential size of the waste dumps (1,000 and 500 tons) and grades reported in the material between the 1949 and 1963 reports contained in the archived files.

Geological Setting
 
Regional Geology
 
Chile is divided into three major physiographic units running north-south, namely the Coastal Cordillera, Central Valley (also termed the Central Depression), and the High Cordillera (Andes). The Carrizal Property lies within the Coastal Cordillera, on the western margin of Chile.
 
There are five main geological units within the Coastal Cordillera, including, (1) early Cretaceous back-arc basin marine carbonates (east); (2) late-Jurassic to early-Cretaceous calc-alkaline volcanic arc rocks (central); (3) early-Cretaceous Coastal batholith (west) (Marschik, 2001); (4) the Atacama fault zone (west) (Marschik, 2001); and (5) Paleozoic basement metasedimentary rocks along the western margin (Hitzman, 2000).
 
The Coastal Cordillera formed in the Mesozoic Era as major plutonic complexes were emplaced into broadly contemporaneous arc and intra-arc volcanics and underlying Paleozoic deformed metasediments (Hitzman, 2000). This time period also saw development of the NW-trending brittle Atacama fault system, followed by widespread extension-induced tilting. Sedimentary sequences accumulated immediately east of the Mesozoic arc terrane in a series of interconnected, predominantly marine, back-arc basins. Early- to mid-Jurassic through mid-Cretaceous volcanism and plutonism throughout the Coastal Cordillera and immediately adjoining regions are generally considered to have taken place under variably extensional conditions in response to retreating subduction boundaries (slab roll-back) and steep, Mariana-type subduction (Hitzman, 2000).
 
Local Geology
 
The Carrizal Property covers two distinct contact zones between Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks in the central section, and late Jurassic diorites and monzodiorites to the northwest and southeast.
 
Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks belonging to the Chanaral Metamorphic Complex are composed of shales, phyllites and quartz-feldspar schists/gneisses (Minera Stamford, 2000). The sedimentary rocks have a strong NNE-striking shallow foliation dipping ~40° southeast. The intrusives towards the southeast corner of the Carrizal Property, in the Farellón Project area, belong to the Canto del Agua formation and consist of diorites and gabbros hosting many NE-oriented intermediate-mafic dykes. These diorites are known to host extensive veining with copper and gold mineralization (Arevalo and Welkner, 2003). Locally, a small stock-like felsic body, called Pan de Azucar, with lesser satellite dykes, intrudes the diorite. The intrusive relationship between the diorite and metasediments on this south end of the Carrizal Property always appears to be tectonic (Willsteed, 1997).
 
Property Geology
 
The southern contact zone between the metasedimentary rocks and the diorite is a mylonitic shear zone, ranging between 5 m and 15 m in width, striking NNE, and dipping ~65° to the northwest. This shear zone is host to mineralized quartz-calcite veins that splay off to the east into the diorites of the adjacent Carrizal Alto Mine area.
 
The Perth project area at the northern end of the Carrizal Property, also hosts a significant NS-trending vein swarm. Although these veins pinch and swell, they are generally 2 m wide and have been measured up to 6 m wide. Individual veins can be traced from a few 100 m to greater than 2 km in length. Most of the veins identified thus far on surface lie within the metasedimentary rocks, however several veins have been traced cross-cutting the northern metasediment-granodiorite contact.
 
Mineralization
 
The Carrizal Property occurs within the Central Andean IOCG Province (Sillitoe, 2003). Vein type, plutonic-hosted IOCG deposits such as Carrizal Alto, and by extension the contiguous Carrizal Property, are characterized by a distinct mineralogy that includes not only copper and gold but also cobalt, nickel, arsenic, molybdenum, and uranium (Sillitoe, 2003; Clark, 1974). All of the IOCG deposits in the region are partially defined by their iron content in the form of either magnetite or hematite (Sillitoe, 2003).

22
--


A variety of alteration assemblages has been noted in the Chilean deposits according to whether or not the deposits are hematite or magnetite dominated:
 

1. | Magnetite-rich veins contain appreciable actinolite, biotite and quartz, as well as local apatite, clinopyroxene, garnet, hematite and K-feldspar, and possess narrow alteration haloes containing one or more of actinolite, biotite, albite, K-feldspar, epidote, quartz, chlorite, sericite and scapolite. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Hematite-rich veins tend to contain sericite and/or chlorite, with or without K-feldspar or albite, and to possess alteration haloes characterized (Sillitoe, 2003) by these same minerals. Typically, the vein deposits of the coastal Cordillera are chalcopyrite, actinolite and magnetite deposits (Ruiz, 1962). 

 
Carrizal Alto, just east of the Carrizal Property, has historically been known as a significant cobalt deposit (Ruiz, 1962; Clark, 1974) and has returned cobalt grades of up to 0.5% Co in the form of cobaltiferous arsenopyrite (Sillitoe, 2003; Ruiz, 1962), carrollite, and other cobalt sulfides (Clark, 1974). Copper mineralization on the Carrizal Property consists of malachite and chrysocolla in the oxide zone and chalcopyrite in the sulfide zone. There is some indication that in the oxide zone some of the copper mineralization is tied up in a goethite-bearing clay matrix (Willsteed, 1997; Floyd, 2009).
 
Alteration associated with the greater shear zone is comprised of actinolite, biotite, sericite, epidote, quartz and carbonate mineralization. The sulfidized quartz-calcite veins occurring within the shear zone can display an intense pyrite-sericite-biotite alteration halo. In places, there is massive siderite and ankerite alteration (Minera Stamford, 2000).
 
Deposit Types
 
The main target on the Carrizal Property is vein-style iron oxide-copper gold (IOCG) mineralization associated with a shear contact between intrusive diorite and metasedimentary rocks, containing significant amounts of iron oxide, copper, gold and cobalt, distinctive of IOCG deposits in the region (Sillitoe, 2003). IOCG deposits of northern Chile are known to exist in the belt from just south of the town of Vallenar (almost 29°S) to just south of Chanaral (26°S) (Hitzman, 2000). Although this deposit type covers a wide spectrum, the characteristic IOCG deposits of northern Chile have been clearly defined by Sillitoe (2003) as:
 
“Iron oxide-copper-gold deposits, defined primarily by their elevated magnetite and/or hematite contents, constitute a broad, ill-defined clan related to a variety of tectono-magmatic settings. The youngest and, therefore, most readily understandable IOCG belt is located in the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile and southern Peru, where it is part of a volcano-plutonic arc of Jurassic through Early Cretaceous age. The arc is characterised by voluminous tholeiitic to calc-alkaline plutonic complexes of gabbro through granodiorite composition and primitive, mantle-derived parentage. Major arc-parallel fault systems developed in response to extension and transtension induced by subduction rollback at the retreating convergent margin. The arc crust was attenuated and subjected to high heat flow. IOCG deposits share the arc with massive magnetite deposits, the copper-deficient end-members of the IOCG clan, as well as with manto-type copper and small porphyry copper deposits to create a distinctive metallogenic signature.”
 
“The IOCG deposits display close relations to the plutonic complexes and broadly coeval fault systems. Based on deposit morphology and dictated in part by lithological and structural parameters, they can be separated into several styles: veins, hydrothermal breccias, replacement mantos, calcic skarns and composite deposits that combine all or many of the preceding types. The vein deposits tend to be hosted by intrusive rocks, especially equigranular gabbrodiorite and diorite, whereas the larger, composite deposits (e.g. Candelaria-Punta del Cobre) occur within volcano-sedimentary sequences up to 2 km from pluton contacts and in intimate association with major orogen-parallel fault systems. Structurally localised IOCG deposits normally share faults and fractures with pre-mineral mafic dykes, many of dioritic composition, thereby further emphasising the close connection with mafic magmatism. The deposits formed in association with sodic, calcic and potassic alteration, either alone or in some combination, reveal evidence of an upward and outward zonation from magnetite-actinolite-apatite to specular hematite-chlorite-sericite and possess Cu-Co-Au-Ni-As-Mo-U-(LREE) (light rare earth element) signature reminiscent of some calcic iron skarns around diorite intrusions. Scant observations suggest that massive calcite veins and, at shallower paleodepths, extensive zones of barren pyritic feldspar-destructive alteration may be indicators of concealed IOCG deposits.”
 
The Carrizal Property lies well within the Chilean IOCG belt and fits many of the tectonic and mineralogical definitions outlined by Sillitoe (2003). The Carrizal Property is considered to be a vein-style IOCG deposit with significant amounts of iron oxide, copper, gold and cobalt distinctive of IOCG deposits in the region.

The main targets on the Carrizal Property are the two mineralized shear contact zones between the metasediments and diorites (Farellón Project area) and monzodiorites (Perth Project area). The shear zone has been interpreted to host several parallel, mineralized lenses.
 
Exploration
 
Between 2009 and 2013 the Company conducted three drill programs and one property wide mapping and sampling program detailed in Carrizal Property - Farellón and Perth Projects - Exploration History. The latest information on the Carrizal Property stems from bulk sampling efforts by a contract artisanal miner between January 2015 and February 2017. During this period the Company collected data from bulk sampling efforts (underground exploration workings and rock sampling) conducted by contract miners on the Carrizal Property. This work resulted in 11,265 tonnes of sulfide-mineralized material with an average grade of 1.67% Cu, 5.8 g/t Ag, and 0.21 g/t Au, as well as 1,813 tonnes of oxide mineralized material with an average grade of 1.56% Cu. The ENAMI processing facility did not have the capacity to recover cobalt; however, three grab samples taken from the same location as the bulk sampling yielded between 0.07% and 0.12% Co.
Drilling
 
The Company has not conducted any drilling activities on the Carrizal Property over the last three-year period. See Carrizal Property - Farellón and Perth Projects - Exploration History for previous drilling results.
Sample Preparation, Analysis, and Security
 
There have been no exploration or drilling samples collected by Red Metal, and as such, there are no preparation, analysis, or security details to describe.
 
MATEO PROPERTY
 
Property Description and Location
 
The Mateo Property is composed of 5 mineral concessions covering 182 hectares in the III Region of Chile, Region de Atacama. The Mateo Property is situated 10 kilometres east of the City of Vallenar with the highest point at approximately 1,050 metres above sea level. The property is located close to power, water, and the urban centre of Vallenar, with a readily available mining workforce.
Accessibility
 
The Mateo Property is easily accessible year-round via a well-used road from Vallenar. The road crosses through the middle of the west half of the property and along the southern border of the east half of the property.
Geology and Mineralization
 
The Mateo Property is located within the brittle-ductile north-south-trending Atacama Fault System that is known to host many of the major deposits in the Candelaria IOCG belt. Known mineralization is hosted in an andesitic volcaniclastic sequent assigned to the Bandurrias Formation. Widespread iron oxide and skarn style alteration indicate an IOCG mineralizing system further supported by significant amounts of economic grade mineralization found in six historic artisanal mines on the property. Mineralization is found in mantos, veins and breccias.
Exploration History
 
Historical work on the Mateo Property includes several drill programs completed by different Chilean private and public companies. Records exist from eight drill holes completed in 1994 on the Irene mine and include two full reports written by ENAMI, the Chilean national mining company, with interpretation of mineralization and recommendations for further exploration and mining work.

The Irene mine was investigated by ENAMI in 1994. Work completed during the time included surface RC drilling, including 490 metres in four RC drill holes, and underground diamond drilling, including 220 metres in four drill holes. The Company obtained ENAMI’s reports of mining activities from 1994 to 1997. Approximately 11,875 tonnes of rock were mining in that time averaging 4.3% copper, 61.9 grams per tonne silver, and 1.01 grams per tonne gold. During the period June 2009 to December 2010, the vendor of the Irene mine, Minera Farellón, conducted small scale mining activities on a different area of the Irene claims and mined 1,705 tonnes grading 1.39% Cu, 1.39 g/t Ag, 0.29 g/t Au in sulphides and 1,477 tonnes grading 1.98% Cu in oxides. The difference in grade between the historic work and recent work is not an indication that further high-grade material will not be found on the Mateo Property and further modeling and exploration work needs to be completed to determine the best drill targets.
 
In 2011, the Company completed a mapping and prospecting program over wide area including the Mateo concessions and a wide area surrounding the concessions. The geological mapping identified nine significant zones of mineralization on the property and confirmed widespread skarn style alteration. Reconnaissance samples were collected on multiple mineralized structures from mantos, veins and mineralized breccia bodies.
 
Samples of 21.72 g/t Au with 0.69% Cu, 3.10 g/t Au with 0.50% Cu and 3.57 g/t Au with 0.62% Cu taken from one vein traced for approximately 350 metres on surface. Multiple mineralized veins, mantos and breccia bodies were identified with 36 of 138 samples returning Au results greater than 1.00 g/t and 59 of 138 samples returning Cu results greater than 1.00%.
 
Additional significant reconnaissance sampling results from the Mateo mapping program are listed below:

Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
 
No mineral processing or metallurgical testing programs have been undertaken on the Mateo Property.
 
Competition
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other similar companies for financing and joint venture partners, and for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration contractors and supplies. We do not represent a competitive presence in the industry.
 
Raw materials
 
The raw materials for our exploration programs include camp equipment, hand exploration tools, sample bags, first aid supplies, groceries and propane. All of these types of materials are readily available from a variety of local suppliers.
 
Dependence on major customers
 
We have no customers. Our first customer likely will be ENAMI, which refines and smelts copper from the ore that it buys from Chile’s small- and medium-scale miners. ENAMI is located in Vallenar. We could also sell our ore to the Dos Amigos heap leach facility located approximately fifty kilometers south of Vallenar in Domeyko.

Patents/Trademarks/Licenses/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements/Labor Contracts
 
We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks, and, other than the royalties that were discussed under the “Unproved mineral properties” section, no royalty agreements or labor contracts.
 
Government controls and regulations
 
We are not required to obtain permits or submit operational plans in order to conduct exploration on our properties. The mining business, however, is subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. We cannot predict what additional legislation or revisions might be proposed that could affect our business or when any proposals, if enacted, might become effective. Such changes, however, could require more operating capital and expenditures and could prevent or delay some of our operations.
 
The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. For mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclaiming and rehabilitating mining properties following the cessation of operations, and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time. As we are not mining or processing, and are unlikely to do so for some years, we have not investigated these regulations.
 
None of the exploration work that we have completed to date requires an environmental permit. We must repair any damage done to the land during exploration. Some of our claims are within the boundaries of a national park. According to the Mining Code of Chile, we will have to get written authorization from the government to mine or complete any exploration work within the park boundaries. We submitted an application to the government in December 2011 to explore within the park boundaries. We received a response to our application requesting we complete an environmental study on the area we are applying to work in. As part of this study, we will have to hire an environmental consultant to investigate if any significant archeological remains exist in the area we intend to work in. Mapping and prospecting work completed north of the park boundary on the Farellón property has shown potential to expand the mineralized zone to the north where exploitation would not fall within the park boundaries. The Company has decided to focus exploration north of the park boundary to determine the potential of the entire mineralized area to host an economic deposit before pursuing the application to work within the park boundary any further.
 
If our operations in Chile become profitable, any earnings that we remit abroad will be subject to Chilean withholding tax.
 
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material government controls and regulations at each of our mineral claims.
 
Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws
 
We have incurred no costs to date for compliance with environmental laws for our exploration programs on any of our claims.
 
Expenditures on research and development
 
We have incurred no research or development costs since our inception on January 10, 2005.
 
Number of total employees and number of full-time employees
 
Red Metal does not have any employees. Caitlin Jeffs, Michael Thompson, and Joao (John) da Costa, who are directors and officers, and Jeffrey Cocks, and Cody McFarlane, directors of the Company, provide their services as independent consultants. Polymet retains the services of an administrative assistant and a bookkeeper located in Chile, who are Polymet’s only employees, other services are provided by independent consultants. The Company contracts for the services of geologists, prospectors and other consultants as and when required.
