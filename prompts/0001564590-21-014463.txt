Item 1. Business. 
Our Company
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing immune modulators and precision therapies to improve the lives of patients with solid tumor cancers. Our primary focus is on developing immuno-oncology and targeted cancer therapies. Each of our product candidates has an innovative mechanism of action and addresses patient populations for which better therapies are needed. In addition, we use companion diagnostics where appropriate to allow us to select patients most likely to benefit from treatment with our product candidates. The most advanced product candidates that we or our partners are developing are identified below.

• | Bemarituzumab (FPA144) is an antibody that inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b, or FGFR2b, and that induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity that we are studying in a clinical trial in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin and oxaliplatin, a standard-of-care chemotherapy regimen known as mFOLFOX6, as front-line treatment of patients with FGFR2b+, non-HER2+ gastric (stomach) or gastroesophageal junction, or GEJ, cancer. In December 2017, we granted Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Zai Lab, an exclusive license to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

• | FPT155 is a soluble CD80 fusion protein that enhances co-stimulation of T cells through CD28 that we are studying in a clinical trial in multiple cancers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FPA157 is an anti-CCR8 antibody that is engineered to deplete CCR8-expressing intratumoral regulatory CD4+ T cells. We are conducting IND-enabling activities for FPA157.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BMS-986258 is an anti-T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3, or TIM-3, antibody that our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, is studying in a clinical trial in combination with Opdivo® (nivolumab) in patients with advanced malignant tumors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our product candidates are typically only-in-class, first-in-class or meaningfully differentiated from other in-class therapeutics. We generally look for single-agent activity or clear activity in, for example, tumor types that are rarely sensitive to checkpoint inhibitors.
 We have two late-stage research programs. These programs arose from our prior in-house target discovery and validation and protein therapeutic generation and engineering capabilities, which we eliminated in 2019. We expect to advance each of these programs through preclinical development relying mostly on outsourced and contracted capabilities. In addition, we plan to supplement our product pipeline from time to time by selectively acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, rights to product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
 COVID-19 Business Update
 In response to the global spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our employees and our business. While we are not experiencing any material financial impacts at this time, given the global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We continue to closely monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as we evolve our business continuity plans and response strategy. In March 2020, our entire workforce, other than those whose job responsibilities require them to be physically present at our offices, transitioned to working remotely, which we have continued through the date of this Annual Report. To date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly impacted our ability to maintain our business operations. 
 1


Clinical Development and Preclinical Activities
 We continue to support our active clinical sites and provide investigational drug supply for patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we and our contract research organizations, or CROs, have taken measures to implement remote and virtual approaches, including remote patient monitoring, where appropriate and possible, to maintain patient safety and trial continuity and to preserve the integrity of our clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively impact our and our CROs’ ability to collect, clean and report clinical trial data or interact with ethics committees or other regulatory authorities due to limitations in employee resources, access to clinical sites or otherwise.
 We rely on CROs to perform most of the activities related to the conduct of our clinical trials, and we expect to advance our preclinical and late-stage research programs through preclinical development relying mostly on out-sourced and contracted capabilities. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic increases the risk that the CROs or other service providers we engage will not be able to perform their contractual obligations relating to our clinical trials or preclinical studies in a timely or satisfactory manner. For example, resource limitations and social distancing requirements may affect the ability of our service providers to timely perform preclinical studies of our product candidates, which would delay our timelines and our potential clinical development of those product candidates.
 If the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic persists, we could experience significant disruptions to and delays in our clinical development and preclinical activities, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
 Supply Chain
 We are working closely with our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and other suppliers to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our drug product supplies as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to have adequate supply of our product candidates and any third-party drug products that may be used to conduct our current and planned preclinical and clinical activities. However, if the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic persists for an extended period of time and impacts these CMOs or other suppliers, or if the pandemic impacts essential distribution systems, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our product candidates or third-party drug products, which would adversely impact our ability to conduct and complete our preclinical studies and clinical trials in accordance with our timelines or at all.
Other Financial and Corporate Impacts
 We may need or desire to seek additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborations, or strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, and if we need or desire to access additional capital in the future, we may be unable to do so and our operations may be negatively impacted.
The extent of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including on our clinical and preclinical programs, and the value of and market for our common stock is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration, spread and severity of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the countries in which we and our collaborators, partners and service providers operate, including in the countries where we and our partners are conducting clinical trials, the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease, including the widespread availability and adoption of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. For example, if remote working arrangements for our business, or those of our partners or service providers, are extended for longer than we currently expect, we may need to reassess our priorities and our near- and longer-term corporate objectives.

We continue to assess the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations. For additional information on the risks posed to our business by the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report.
 Strategy
 Our goal is to build a leadership position in the development and commercialization of oncology therapeutics. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Focus on oncology therapeutics. There continues to be significant medical need for innovative and effective cancer therapies. With the significant experience and expertise of our clinical scientists in the field of oncology, we believe we are well positioned to develop and clinically evaluate effective and innovative protein therapeutics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to advance and expand our pipeline. We have a robust pipeline of proprietary and partnered targeted therapeutics that address multiple cell types in the tumor microenvironment. We and our partners are currently advancing bemarituzumab, FPT155 and BMS-986258 through clinical development and FPA157 and certain partnered programs through preclinical development. We also have two late-stage research programs. We plan to focus our resources on the further development of our product candidates, advancing our preclinical and late-stage research programs into clinical and preclinical development and supplementing our ongoing development pipeline from time to time by selectively acquiring or in-licensing, on an exclusive basis, rights to develop product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish strategic license agreements and product and clinical collaborations to supplement our development capabilities and generate funding. From time to time, we plan to establish additional product and clinical collaborations. These collaborations will allow us to supplement our development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization capabilities to broaden and accelerate clinical development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, provide us with significant funding to advance our pipeline and validate our technology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a U.S.-focused commercial enterprise by retaining U.S. commercial rights for our products. As our product candidates near commercialization, we plan to build sales and marketing capabilities in the United States that we can adequately serve as we work toward becoming a focused commercial organization. We currently have global rights to bemarituzumab, FPT155, FPA157 and our proprietary preclinical and research-stage programs, except that we granted Zai Lab an exclusive license to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clinical Programs
 Bemarituzumab (FPA144)
 Bemarituzumab is an antibody that inhibits FGFR2b that we are developing to treat epithelial cancers that overexpress FGFR2b. We have developed, in collaboration with a third-party companion diagnostic development partner, an immunohistochemistry-, or IHC-, based assay to identify patients with FGFR2b+ gastric and GEJ cancer who would be most likely to benefit from treatment with bemarituzumab. We plan to conduct additional work with our third-party companion diagnostic development partner to adapt this IHC-based assay to identify FGFR2b overexpression in other epithelial cancers such as non-small cell lung, breast and ovarian cancers to support our clinical development of bemarituzumab to treat FGFR2b+ epithelial cancers.
 We believe that bemarituzumab acts on tumor cells in two ways:
  
• | bemarituzumab binds to FGFR2b and blocks certain FGFs from binding to FGFR2b, preventing these FGFs from promoting the growth of the tumor cells; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | once bemarituzumab binds to FGFR2b on the surface of the tumor cell, bemarituzumab recruits natural killer immune cells into the tumor microenvironment to kill the tumor cell in a process called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Development of Bemarituzumab 
 We are completing a global Phase 2 clinical trial of bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 as front-line treatment of patients with advanced FGFR2b+, non-HER2+ gastric or GEJ cancer, which we refer to as the FIGHT trial. The FIGHT trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bemarituzumab in combination with standard-of-care mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy as compared to placebo in combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy in front-line gastric and GEJ cancers. We are conducting the FIGHT trial in China in collaboration with Zai Lab. The FIGHT trial enrolled 155 patients in 15 countries across Asia, the European Union and the United States, with 77 patients randomized to the bemarituzumab arm and 78 patients randomized to the placebo arm.
 4


We identified patients for inclusion in the FIGHT trial using both an IHC test, which allowed us to detect FGFR2b overexpression on the tumor tissue in a biopsy specimen, and a ctDNA blood-based test, which allowed us to detect FGFR2 gene amplification from DNA shed by tumor cells in blood plasma. FGFR2 gene amplification is a cause of FGFR2b overexpression, and measuring FGFR2 gene amplification in the blood is an indirect way of identifying tumors that overexpress FGFR2b that we may otherwise not identify using an IHC test. We excluded from eligibility for the trial any patients known to be HER2+. We screened over 900 patients and found that approximately 30% of non-HER2+ gastric and GEJ cancers overexpress FGFR2b. The frequency of FGFR2b overexpression was similar across Asia, the European Union and the United States.
 In November 2020, we announced that all three primary and secondary endpoints in the FIGHT trial met pre-specified statistical significance (at a 2-sided alpha of 0.20) as compared to placebo in combination with mFOLFOX6. The primary endpoint in the FIGHT trial was progression-free survival, or PFS, and the secondary efficacy endpoints were overall survival, or OS, and objective response rate, or ORR. In January 2021, clinical results from the FIGHT trial were presented in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Virtual Annual Symposium, or the 2021 ASCO GI presentation. As of the September 28, 2020 data cutoff date for the 2021 ASCO GI presentation, the FIGHT trial demonstrated the following efficacy results for bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 as compared to placebo in combination with mFOLFOX6:
  
• | an increase in median PFS from 7.4 months in the placebo arm to 9.5 months in the bemarituzumab arm (hazard ratio 0.68; 95% confidence interval 0.44 – 1.04; p = 0.073);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in median OS from 12.9 months in the placebo arm to not reached in the bemarituzumab arm (hazard ratio 0.58; 95% confidence interval 0.35 – 0.95; p = 0.027); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an improvement in ORR of 13.1%, from 33.3% in the placebo arm to 46.8% in the bemarituzumab arm (95% confidence interval -29.0% to 2.8%; p = 0.106).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional analysis of the data showed a correlation between higher levels of FGFR2b overexpression and an increase in PFS and OS benefit in patients in the bemarituzumab arm, confirming both the importance of the FGFR2b target and the activity of bemarituzumab against the FGFR2b target.
 The incidence of all of the following adverse events was comparable between patients in the bemarituzumab treatment arm and patients in the placebo arm of the study: adverse events of any grade (100% vs. 98.7%, respectively), serious adverse events (31.6% vs. 36.4%, respectively) and deaths due to adverse events (6.6% vs. 5.2%, respectively). Stomatitis (31.6% vs 13.0%) and elevated transaminases (34.2% vs 19.5%) were more common in the bemarituzumab arm as compared to the placebo arm of the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events that were grade 3 or higher were also more frequently reported in patients receiving bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 (82.9%) as compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with mFOLFOX6 (74.0%).
 Ocular events are common in therapies targeting FGFR and were also reported in the FIGHT trial. As expected, corneal events were reported more frequently in the bemarituzumab arm (67.1% vs 10.4%), with the most common being dry eye (26.3%), keratitis (15.8%) and punctate keratitis (14.5%). More patients discontinued bemarituzumab (34.2%) compared to placebo (5.2%) due to an adverse event, and the majority of these patients (21 of 26 patients) discontinued bemarituzumab due to an ocular event. The discontinuation of bemarituzumab due to an ocular event decreased the median duration of exposure to bemarituzumab by 3.2 weeks; from 25.3 weeks (n=55, range: 2.0 to 71.7 weeks) for patients who did not experience an ocular event to 22.1 weeks (n=21, range: 12.0 to 46.7 weeks) for patients who experienced an ocular event. There were no reported treatment-emergent adverse events of retinal pigment epithelial detachment or hyperphosphatemia in patients receiving bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6. 
 The data observed in the FIGHT trial support the advancement of the development of bemarituzumab as a potential treatment for FGFR2b+, non-HER2+ gastric and GEJ cancer. Accordingly, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of bemarituzumab in gastric and GEJ cancer by the end of 2021. For future clinical trials of bemarituzumab, we plan to work closely with investigators and advisors to incorporate best practices based on our findings from the FIGHT trial to better identify and minimize the occurrence of corneal adverse events and to manage these events when they do occur, including baseline eye exams, prophylactic lubricating eye drops and close monitoring for signs and symptoms of corneal toxicity, including dry eye. 
 5


In addition, we believe the FIGHT data support the potential development of bemarituzumab in other epithelial cancers that overexpress FGFR2b, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. We plan to initiate clinical development of bemarituzumab in other epithelial cancers that overexpress FGFR2b by the end of the year.
 Market Opportunity
 Globally, gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy with the third highest mortality. It is estimated that nearly 500,000 patients were diagnosed with gastric or GEJ cancer in 2020 globally. Of these patients, approximately 330,000 patients were diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, of which approximately 260,000 are diagnosed with HER2- metastatic gastric or GEJ cancer, and nearly 75,000 of these patients have FGFR2b+ cancers. No new frontline therapies have been approved for these patients in over a decade, and systemic chemotherapy remains the standard of care. We believe bemarituzumab has the potential to offer new advancements in the treatment of FGFR2b+, HER2- metastatic gastric or GEJ cancers.
In June 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, granted Orphan Drug Designation to bemarituzumab for the treatment of gastric cancer, including GEJ cancer, in patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b. 
 In addition to gastric and GEJ cancer, the literature have reported meaningful FGFR2b overexpression in numerous other epithelial tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. We believe the data we observed in the FIGHT trial support the potential development of bemarituzumab in these and other cancers that overexpress FGFR2b.
 Under our China collaboration agreement, we granted Zai Lab an exclusive license to develop bemarituzumab in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. We plan to continue to seek strategic collaborators to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab in other territories. We plan to retain the right to commercialize or co-commercialize bemarituzumab in the United States.
 FPT155
 FPT155 is a soluble CD80-Fc fusion protein. CD80 is a member of the B7 family of checkpoint inhibitors that is involved in modulating T cell priming and activation. This program came from our in vivo screens, which demonstrated that a soluble form of CD80 had potent in vivo anti-tumor activity when compared with 500 other immune-related proteins. FPT155 uses the binding interactions of soluble CD80 to (i) block CTLA-4 from competing for endogenous CD80, allowing CD28 signaling to prevail in T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment and (ii) directly engage CD28 to enhance its co-stimulatory T cell activation activity without inducing super agonism.
 Clinical Development of FPT155
 We are conducting a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial of FPT155 in patients with solid tumors. We have completed enrollment of patients at the 560 mg (flat dosing every 3 weeks) monotherapy dose level and have begun enrolling patients at the 840 mg (flat dosing every 3 weeks) monotherapy dose level. We have observed pharmacodynamic biomarker data in the Phase 1a dose escalation portion of the trial that show expansion of central memory T cells in the blood, which is consistent with the predicted mechanism of action of FPT155 that has been observed in preclinical studies.
 As part of the trial, we have also tested FPT155 as monotherapy in exploratory cohorts with tumor types and at dose levels at which we have not observed any dose-limiting toxicities and at which we have observed efficacy in preclinical models, with the objective of gaining additional data on safety, pharmacokinetics and potential preliminary single-agent clinical activity of FPT155. In this exploratory cohort, we enrolled patients with tumors likely to have T cell infiltration, which are commonly referred to as “warm” or “hot” tumors.
 Although we anticipate single-agent activity of FPT155, early safety data we have observed in the trial and preclinical data suggest that FPT155 may be safely combined with an anti-PD-1 therapy, and that the combination will be synergistic. Accordingly, we are evaluating patients in a dose escalation cohort in the Phase 1a portion of the trial to evaluate the combination of FPT155 and pembrolizumab in patients with PD(L)-1 treated non-small cell lung cancer. We are currently enrolling patients in the third combination cohort (280 mg of FPT155 flat dosing every three weeks). We plan to follow the dose escalation of the combination with an expansion cohort evaluating a selected dose of FPT155 in combination with pembrolizumab in the same patient population.
 6


We expect to determine the development path for FPT155 in “warm” and “hot” tumors in 2021 based on monotherapy clinical results at the 560mg and 840mg dose levels and combination clinical results from the ongoing dose escalation.
BMS-986258
 BMS-986258 is a fully human monoclonal antibody against TIM-3, an immune checkpoint receptor that is known to limit the duration and magnitude of T cell responses. BMS-986258 binds to TIM-3 that is expressed on certain T cells, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. This abrogates T cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which together result in decreased tumor growth. BMS-986258 is BMS’s first clinical candidate arising from our March 2014 immuno-oncology research collaboration. 
 Clinical Development of BMS-986258
 BMS is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BMS-986258 in combination with Opdivo and in combination with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.’s rHuPH20 in patients with advanced malignant tumors (NCT03446040). 
 Preclinical Programs
 FPA157
 FPA157 is an anti-CCR8 antibody that is engineered to eliminate CCR8-expressing CD4+ regulatory T cells within solid tumors. This program originated from an in-house screen that we used to identify extracellular targets preferentially expressed by CD4+ regulatory T cells that reside within tumors. Preclinical efficacy studies performed in mouse models confirmed that depletion of CCR8-expressing intratumoral regulatory T cells yields a potent anti-tumor response. We believe FPA157 will provide therapeutic benefit to patients by removing the restraints that intratumoral regulatory T cells impose on anti-tumor immunity, and that these effects may be distinct from the PD-1 pathway.
 We are currently conducting IND-enabling activities for FPA157.
 Late-Stage Research Programs
 We currently have two late-stage research programs that arose from our work with our discovery capabilities. We expect to advance each of our late-stage research programs through preclinical development relying mostly on outsourced and contracted capabilities.
Collaborations and License Agreements
 A part of our strategy is to establish collaborations with strategic partners. These collaborations allow us to supplement our development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization capabilities to broaden and accelerate clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates, provide us with significant funding to advance our pipeline and validate our technology. 
 In addition, our strategy for supplementing our ongoing development pipeline from time to time is to selectively acquire or license, on an exclusive basis, rights to develop product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We continue to evaluate for potential acquisition or licensing assets that are IND-ready or in early clinical development and that we can leverage our in-house development capabilities to develop to data read-outs in the near- to medium-term. Our primary focus remains on oncology therapeutics. 
 A summary of our key product, clinical and discovery collaborations and license agreements is set forth below. For information regarding the financial terms of the following agreements, including amounts we have received through December 31, 2020, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Overview – Collaboration and License Revenue.”
 Collaborations
 Zai Lab China License and Collaboration Agreement
 In December 2017, we entered into the China collaboration agreement with Zai Lab, pursuant to which we granted Zai Lab an exclusive license to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab, and all fragments, conjugates, derivatives and modifications thereof, or the licensed antibody, in China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, each a region, and collectively, the territory. 
 7


Under the terms of the China collaboration agreement, Zai Lab will be responsible, at its expense, for (i) developing and commercializing products containing the licensed antibody, each, a licensed product, under a territory development plan, and (ii) performing certain development activities to support our global development and registration of licensed products, including the FIGHT trial, in the territory, under a global development plan. In addition, Zai Lab agreed to reimburse us for certain global development activities, which is limited to a maximum of $10.0 million, and certain costs for the development of companion diagnostics.
 In January 2018, pursuant to the terms of the China collaboration agreement, Zai Lab paid us a $5.0 million non-refundable and non-creditable upfront fee ($4.2 million after netting value-added tax withholdings). Additionally, pursuant to the China collaboration agreement, with respect to each licensed product, we will be eligible to receive up to $39.0 million in specified developmental and regulatory milestone payments.
 Zai Lab will also be obligated to pay us a royalty, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and region-by-region basis, in the high teens or low twenties, depending on the number of patients Zai Lab enrolled in the FIGHT trial, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, on net sales of each licensed product in the territory until the latest of (i) 11 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such region, (ii) the expiration of certain patents covering such licensed product in such region, and (iii) the date on which any applicable regulatory, pediatric, orphan drug or data exclusivity with respect to such licensed product expires in such region. We cannot determine the date on which Zai Lab’s potential royalty payment obligations to us would expire because Zai Lab has not yet developed any licensed products under the agreement, and we therefore cannot at this time identify the date of the first commercial sale of or expiration of any related patents covering or regulatory exclusivity periods with respect to any licensed products.
 Under the China collaboration agreement, provided that Zai Lab enrolls and treats a specified number of patients in the FIGHT trial in China, Zai Lab is eligible to receive a low single-digit percentage royalty, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, on net sales of a licensed product outside the territory until 10 years after the first commercial sale of each such licensed product outside the territory.
 Unless earlier terminated by either party, the China collaboration agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and region-by-region basis upon the expiration of Zai Lab’s payment obligations with respect to each licensed product under the agreement. Zai Lab may terminate the agreement in its entirety at any time with advance written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety with written notice for Zai Lab’s material breach of its diligence obligations with respect to development and obtaining marketing approval, and may terminate the agreement on a region-by-region basis for Zai Lab’s breach of its diligence obligations with respect to timely commercialization of a licensed product in a region following marketing approval. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety if Zai Lab or its affiliates or sublicensees commences a legal action challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of any of our patents in the territory. Either party also may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party.
 BMS Immuno-oncology Research Collaboration 
 In March 2014, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement, or the immuno-oncology research collaboration, with BMS pursuant to which we and BMS are collaborating to carry out a research program to (i) discover novel interacting proteins in two undisclosed immune checkpoint pathways using our target discovery platform, (ii) further the understanding of target biology with respect to targets in these checkpoint pathways, and (iii) discover and pre-clinically develop compounds suitable for development for human therapeutic uses against targets in these checkpoint pathways. Based on data arising from our initial screens, in January 2016, we amended the immuno-oncology research collaboration to add an additional undisclosed checkpoint pathway to the research program, for a total of three immune checkpoint pathways.
 In December 2017, we earned a $5.0 million milestone payment under the discovery collaboration agreement in connection with BMS’s filing of an IND for BMS-986258, BMS’s anti-TIM-3 antibody. This antibody is BMS’s first clinical candidate arising from the collaboration.
 The initial three-year research term of the immuno-oncology research collaboration ended in March 2017. BMS exercised its option to extend the research term to March 2018 and then again to extend the research term for an additional year to March 2019. BMS agreed to provide us with funding for our additional research during the extended term. BMS does not have the right to extend the research term beyond March 2019.
 8


In connection with entering into the immuno-oncology research collaboration, BMS paid us an upfront payment of $20.0 million. We are eligible to receive up to $240.0 million per collaboration target in specified developmental-, regulatory- and commercialization-related contingent payments comprising aggregate developmental-related contingent payments of up to $53.0 million, aggregate regulatory-related contingent payments of up to $74.0 million and aggregate commercialization-related contingent payments of up to $113.0 million. We are also eligible to receive up to $60.0 million in sales-based contingent payments per collaboration product.
 For each commercialized product under the immuno-oncology research collaboration that is directed toward a target in a checkpoint pathway, BMS is also obligated to pay us tiered mid-single digit to low double-digit percentage royalties, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, on net sales of such product for the longer of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such product, (ii) the life of certain licensed patents covering such product or (iii) the date on which any applicable regulatory, pediatric, orphan drug or data exclusivity with respect to such product expires. We cannot determine the date on which BMS’s potential royalty payment obligations to us would expire because BMS has not yet commercialized any products under the immuno-oncology research collaboration, and we therefore cannot identify the date of the first commercial sale of or expiration of any related patents covering such product.
 Unless earlier terminated by either party, the immuno-oncology research collaboration will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of all of BMS’s payment obligations under the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement. BMS may terminate the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement in its entirety or on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis at any time with advance written notice. Either party may terminate the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement in its entirety or on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such other party fails to timely cure the breach. Either party also may terminate the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party. 
 License Agreements 
 License Agreement with Galaxy 
 In December 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Galaxy Biotech LLC, or Galaxy, pursuant to which Galaxy granted us an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize FGFR2b antibodies, including bemarituzumab. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in at least one tumor indication. 
 In May 2016, we amended the license agreement to revise certain milestone definitions, reduce certain milestone payments and add certain development-related milestone payments that were triggered by dosing of certain patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial of bemarituzumab, which milestones were deemed achieved as of December 31, 2016. In May 2017, we further amended the license agreement to align the net sales definition under the agreement to the net sales definition under any sublicense we may grant under the agreement and to amend the termination provisions to allow for a direct license between Galaxy and any sublicensee upon termination of the agreement.
 Through December 31, 2020, we made milestone payments to Galaxy totaling $14.6 million. We are obligated to pay Galaxy additional milestone payments of up to $77.4 million, comprising aggregate intellectual property-related milestone payments of up to $3.0 million, aggregate development-related milestone payments of up to $17.5 million for development in two indications, aggregate regulatory-related milestone payments of up to $41.5 million for two indications and aggregate commercial-related milestone payments of up to $30.0 million. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties on net sales of bemarituzumab from the high-single digits to the low-double digits.
 Our license agreement with Galaxy will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations in all countries. For each licensed product, we are obligated to pay Galaxy royalties on net sales of such product on a country-by-country basis for the longer of the life of the licensed patents covering such licensed product in such country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We cannot determine the date on which our royalty payment obligations to Galaxy would expire because no commercial sales of bemarituzumab have occurred and the last-to-expire relevant patent covering bemarituzumab in a given country may change in the future. Galaxy currently has issued patents, which we have licensed, covering bemarituzumab in the United States, Europe, China, Japan and other countries that expire in 2029. Further patents may issue from pending patent applications in these and other countries and these patents would expire in 2029. These patent expiration dates do not reflect any patent term adjustments or extensions that may be available.

We may terminate the license agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis upon prior written notice to Galaxy. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety or with respect to certain countries after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in certain circumstances in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Either party may terminate the license agreement in the event of the other party’s filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of its assets for the benefit of creditors. Galaxy may terminate the license agreement if we or any of our affiliates challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent licensed to us by Galaxy under the license agreement or if we aid or assist any affiliate or third party in such a challenge other than as required by law. 
 Non-Exclusive License with BioWa-Lonza 
 In February 2012, we entered into a license agreement with BioWa, Inc. and Lonza Sales AG, or BioWa-Lonza, pursuant to which BioWa-Lonza granted us a non-exclusive license to use their Potelligent® CHOK1SV technology, including the CHOK1SV cell line, and a non-exclusive license to related know-how and patents. This license is necessary to produce our bemarituzumab antibody. 
 Under the agreement, we made milestone payments to BioWa-Lonza totaling $1.2 million through December 31, 2020. We are obligated to pay BioWa-Lonza additional milestone payments of up to $24.7 million for regulatory and commercialization milestones achieved in our bemarituzumab antibody program. We are also obligated to pay BioWa-Lonza tiered royalties on net sales of bemarituzumab up to mid-single digit percentages of the proceeds of such sales. 
 Our license agreement with BioWa-Lonza will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations. For each licensed product, we are obligated to pay BioWa-Lonza royalties on net sales of such licensed product on a country-by-country basis for the longer of the life of the licensed patents covering such licensed product in such country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in a major market country, which includes the United States. However, because we believe the last-to-expire patents currently licensed to us under the license agreement would expire in less than 10 years, we believe the date on which our royalty payment obligations to BioWa-Lonza would expire in any country would be 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in a major market country. 
 We may terminate the license agreement for convenience subject to our continuing obligation to pay royalties. BioWa-Lonza may terminate the license agreement in the event of our uncured material breach, if we oppose or dispute the validity of patents licensed to us under the license agreement or if we are declared insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or have a receiver or trustee appointed for substantially all our property. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other biological discoveries relating to new targets, pathways and relevant inventions and technologies that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally initially pursue patent protection covering both compositions of matter and methods of use. 
 Throughout the development of our product candidates, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use, combination therapy, biomarker and companion diagnostic related claims. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our product candidates and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our success will also depend significantly on our ability to obtain rights to intellectual property held by third parties that may be necessary or useful to our business, including for the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates. We generally obtain rights to third-party intellectual property through exclusive or non-exclusive licenses. For example, we entered into a non-exclusive license with BioWa-Lonza to use their proprietary protein expression and cell line technology, which is necessary to produce certain of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain rights to intellectual property held by third parties that are necessary or useful to our business, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 10


The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly limited before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below: 
 Bemarituzumab
 Our bemarituzumab patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications we exclusively licensed from Galaxy, as well as U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications wholly owned by us. The patent portfolio covers compositions of matter, methods of use, companion diagnostics, combination therapies and formulations relating to bemarituzumab. The issued U.S. patents and issued foreign patents, covering compositions of matter and methods of use, expire between 2029 and 2034. Patents that may issue from the pending U.S. and foreign applications would expire between 2029 and 2039. 
 FPT155
 Our patent portfolio for FPT155 includes pending U.S. and foreign patent applications wholly owned by us. Those pending applications cover compositions of matter, methods of use, combination therapies, biomarkers and formulations relating to FPT155. The issued U.S. patent covering compositions of matter and methods of use, expires in 2036. Patents that may issue from the pending U.S. and foreign applications would expire between 2036 and 2041.
 Manufacturing 
 We currently have process development capabilities. Historically, we generally performed cell line and process development for our product candidates and manufactured quantities of our product candidates necessary to conduct preclinical studies of those product candidates. We expect to increasingly rely on third-party service providers and may in the foreseeable future outsource all or a portion of the cell line and process development activities that we currently conduct, as well as the manufacturing of quantities of our product candidates for use in preclinical studies. We do not have and do not currently plan to acquire or develop the facilities or capabilities to manufacture bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in human clinical trials or commercialization. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance required for our clinical trials and expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture clinical trial drug supplies for the foreseeable future. We also contract with additional third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes. 
 We must manufacture drug product for clinical trial use in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved. Our third-party manufacturers and their facilities are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other authorities to assess our and their compliance with applicable regulations, including inspection and review of the procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. 
 11


Commercialization 
 We have not yet established sales, marketing or product distribution operations. We generally expect to retain some commercial rights in the United States for our product candidates in specialty markets. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with third-party therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any companion diagnostics. The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 The acquisition and licensing of pharmaceutical product candidates is also very competitive. More established companies that have strategies to license or acquire products may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies that take similar or different approaches to product acquisitions and licensing. 
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates protein therapeutics like bemarituzumab, FPT155, FPA157 and our other product candidates as biological drug products, or biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and related regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development or approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial actions. These actions could include the suspension or termination of clinical trials by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, revocation of a biologics license, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, import detention, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any administrative or judicial action involving us or our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, effectiveness, safety, purity, potency, labeling, storage, distribution, recordkeeping and reporting, approval, import and export, advertising and promotion and post-market surveillance of biologics, including our current and potential future product candidates. 
 The FDA’s and comparable regulatory agencies’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of any current or future product candidates or approval of product or manufacturing changes, new disease indications, or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. 
 12


Biologics Product Development 
 The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | Preclinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | submission of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical trials can begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic for its intended use or uses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, which must occur before a biologic can be marketed or sold.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any new approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Before testing any compound in human subjects, a company must develop extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act and related regulations. 
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an IND application must be submitted to the FDA. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, within the 30-day time period, the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such case, the sponsor of the IND application must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial can begin. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the clinical trial plan before the trial commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable safety risk. 
 A clinical trial sponsor is required to submit to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public posting on NIH’s clinical trial website details about certain active clinical trials and clinical trial results. For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following phases, which may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1 — the biologic is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, reactivity, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence of effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product’s effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 — clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 — when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the product appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements in order for the resulting data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. 
 The Biologics License Application Approval Process 
 In order to obtain approval to market a biologic in the United States, a BLA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product for the proposed indication must be submitted to the FDA. Each BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to, among other things, the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling. The application may include data from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, as well as supplemental data from alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. 
 The FDA will initially review a BLA for completeness before it accepts such BLA for filing. Under the FDA’s procedures, the agency has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA, or the filing period, to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, efficacious, pure and potent, which includes determining whether the product is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP and in a manner that assures and preserves the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 During the approval process, the FDA will also determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh its risks. Depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug, a REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to training and certification requirements for prescribers and/or pharmacies to safe use conditions that must be in place before the drug is dispensed. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the BLA applicant must submit a proposed REMS that the FDA deems satisfactory in order for the FDA to approve the BLA. 
 The FDA’s standard review time for a BLA for a new molecular entity is 10 months from the end of the filing period. Based on pivotal clinical trial results submitted in a BLA, at the discretion of the FDA or upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant a priority review designation to a product, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the end of the filing period. Priority review is given for a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products or offer a therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists. Priority review designation does not change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 After the FDA completes its review of a BLA, it will either communicate to the sponsor that it will approve the product or issue a complete response letter to communicate that it will not approve the BLA in its current form and to inform the sponsor of changes that the sponsor must make or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the FDA can complete review and ultimately approve the application, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the sponsor may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Resubmitting a BLA in response to a complete response letter can add additional time to the approval process for a product. 
 14


Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct a clinical trial of the product in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional data or information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 The testing and approval process for a biologic requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. 
 The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These additional Phase 4 clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing product approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. Conversely, the results of Phase 4 clinical trials can raise new issues of safety or effectiveness that were not apparent during the original review of the BLA for a product, which may result in product restrictions or even withdrawal of product approval. The FDA has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the FDA. If any of our products are subject to post-marketing requirements and commitments, there may be resource and financial implications for our business.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval will be limited to specific disease states, patient populations or dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study or clinical trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, requirements to conduct additional studies or trials, or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action. 
 FDA Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for recordkeeping, reporting of adverse experiences with the biologic, and submitting biological product deviation reports to notify the FDA of unanticipated changes in distributed products. Manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP standards. As a result, we and our third-party manufacturers must implement certain quality processes, and manufacturing controls and comply with documentation requirements in order to ensure that any approved product is safe and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality, purity and potency characteristics, that it purports to have. Certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, some of which require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, refuse to approve any BLA or other application, force us to recall a drug from distribution, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of the BLA for any affected biologic. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action. 
 15


The FDA and other federal and state agencies closely regulate the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs. While doctors may prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use as long as consistent with any REMS restrictions, if applicable, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a product that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to market a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make relating to our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions, potential civil and criminal penalties, criminal prosecution and agreements with governmental agencies that materially restrict the manner in which we may promote or distribute drug products. Government regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities, have recently increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs. 
 Orphan Drug and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation and Exclusivity 
 The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which are generally diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a biologic is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or the PREA, submission of a pediatric assessment is not typically required for pediatric investigation of a product that has been granted orphan drug designation. However, under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the scope of the PREA was extended to require pediatric studies for products intended for the treatment of an adult cancer that are directed at a molecular target that the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. 
 The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from FDA user fees. Orphan designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Generally, if a product that receives orphan designation is approved for the orphan indication, it receives orphan drug exclusivity, which prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same use for seven years. Additionally, if a biologic designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or provides a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease, which could create a more competitive market for us. 
 After the FDA grants orphan designation, the FDA publicly discloses the identity of the applicant, as well as the name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use. 
 Similarly, the European Commission grants orphan medicinal product designation to products intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating affecting not more than five in 10,000 people. In order to receive orphan designation, there must also be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition, or if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. In addition, sponsors are required to submit to the European Medicines Agency’s, or EMA’s, Pediatric Committee, or the PDCO, and comply with a pediatric investigation plan, or a PIP, in order to initiate pivotal clinical investigation and seek marketing authorization for pediatric use of the product in the EU.
 16


Designated orphan medicinal products are entitled to a range of incentives during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for study protocols, a partial or total reduction in fees and eligibility for conditional marketing authorization. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU member states. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of such product. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is established to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. After five years, a member state can request that the period of market exclusivity be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated the criteria for orphan designation no longer apply and the medicine is sufficiently profitable. The period of market exclusivity may be extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created a licensure framework for biosimilars, which could ultimately subject our biological product candidates to competition from biosimilars. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an abbreviated application for licensure of a biologic that is “biosimilar to” a referenced branded biologic. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively than if a “full” BLA were submitted by relying to some extent on the FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference biologic to which the proposed product is similar. 
 Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor’s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted to the sponsor of the reference product. No biosimilar application may be submitted until four years after the date of approval of the reference product, and no such application, once submitted, may receive final approval until twelve years after that same date (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results are reported to the FDA). Once approved, biosimilar products likely would compete with (and in some circumstances, may be deemed under the law to be “interchangeable with”) the previously approved reference product.
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 As part of our clinical development plans, we have engaged third-party collaborators to develop companion diagnostics to identify patients most likely to respond to certain of our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States. The FDA regulates medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA. The use of companion diagnostics with therapeutic products raises important concerns about the safety and effectiveness of both the companion diagnostic devices and the corresponding therapeutic products and, therefore, the companion diagnostic will ordinarily require PMA before it is marketed. Because the companion diagnostic tests that we are developing or may develop in the future are essential for the safety and effective use of certain of our therapeutics, these diagnostic tests would be subject to the PMA approval process.
 17


The PMA process is costly, lengthy and uncertain as to outcome. PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For companion diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take six months. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application, and where practical, will identify what is necessary to secure approval of the PMA. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while such trials are conducted, after which the data are then submitted in an amendment to the PMA application. Once granted, a PMA may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 We and any third party collaborator that we engage to develop companion diagnostics will work cooperatively to generate the data required for submission with the PMA application, and will remain in contact with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, at the FDA to ensure that any changes in requirements are incorporated into the development plans. We anticipate that meetings with the FDA with regard to our drug product candidates, as well as companion diagnostic product candidates, will include representatives from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or the CDER, and CDRH to ensure that the BLA and PMA submissions are coordinated to enable the FDA to conduct a parallel review of both submissions. FDA guidance addresses issues critical to developing companion diagnostics, such as biomarker qualification, establishing clinical validity, the use of retrospective data, the appropriate patient population and whether the FDA will require that the device and the drug be approved simultaneously. According to the guidance, if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on a diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the FDA’s approval of the therapeutic product. We plan to structure our programs for the development of our companion diagnostics to be consistent with this guidance. 
 In the European Economic Area, or the EEA, in vitro medical devices are required to conform with essential requirements by undergoing a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. We expect our companion diagnostic will require a conformity assessment through an accredited EEA Notified Body, and that the data generated for the U.S. registration will be sufficient to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the European Union and other countries.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed care providers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is granted, the reimbursement rates paid for covered products might not be adequate. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement to allow us to sell such products on a competitive and profitable basis. For example, under these circumstances, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer our products and patients may decline to purchase such products. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future success. 
 18


The market for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on the degree to which these products are listed on third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included on such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor may individually establish coverage and reimbursement policies, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement can be a time-consuming and costly process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. Additionally, companion diagnostic tests that we or our collaborators may develop require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biologics products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biologics products, will apply to companion diagnostic tests.
 Anti-Kickback, False Claims, Physician Payments Sunshine and Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing, several other types of U.S. state and federal laws are relevant to certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, including their interactions with healthcare providers. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, false claims statutes, and the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and other healthcare laws. We are subject to these laws and they may affect our business. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other individuals and entities on the other hand. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and subsequent legislation, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have violated the statute. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions; however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to a government program, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced investigations and private lawsuits and, in many cases, have agreed to significant and burdensome settlements under these laws for a variety of allegedly improper promotional and marketing activities, including inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates; providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe products; or engaging in promotion for “off-label” uses. Federal False Claims Act violations may result in significant civil monetary penalties, including three times the damages incurred by the government from the violation and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The majority of U.S. states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, and in some states, apply regardless of the payor.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA also imposes obligations on certain covered entities, which include healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information and their covered subcontractors, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to track payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests, and to publicly report such data. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives. Manufacturers subject to the Open Payments Program must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. Failure to comply with the reporting obligations may result in civil monetary penalties. 
 Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain healthcare providers. Some states also require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and report information on the pricing of certain drugs. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal or civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, even if they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries have been a particular focus of these efforts and have been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures that have changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision that became effective January 1, 2019 and repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which payment is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when a decision will be made. Further, although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures are also increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biologics product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will continue to be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing our activities outside of the United States, including clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly across jurisdictions, and the time required to obtain marketing approval in jurisdictions outside of the United States may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 51 full-time employees and no part-time employees. Of these employees, 27 were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 12 have an M.D. or a Ph.D. degree. 
 In October 2019, we implemented a corporate restructuring, pursuant to which we eliminated 63 positions across all functions. We completed this restructuring in 2020.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities to achieve our objectives. 
 Corporate Information 
 Our principal corporate offices are located at 111 Oyster Point Boulevard, South San Francisco, California 94080 and our telephone number is (415) 365-5600. We were incorporated in December 2001 in Delaware and completed our initial public offering in September 2013.
