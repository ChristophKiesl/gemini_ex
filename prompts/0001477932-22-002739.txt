DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Our Corporate History and Background

The Company was incorporated on July 1, 1999, under the laws of the State of Nevada, under the name “Han Logistics, Inc.” On August The Company was originally founded February 1, 2006 as Dycam, Inc. In March 2006, the Company changed its name to Mekju Processing, Inc. In November 2006, the Company changed its name to Auxium Technologies, Inc. In November 2014, the Company changed its name to Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. On November 2, 2015, the Company changed its name to Wincash Resources, Inc. In early 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to switch directions and become involved in the business of the collection and ultimately the sale of diamond jewelry. On January 3, 2018, the Company effected a name change and changed its name from Wincash Resources, Inc. to Fovea Jewelry Holdings, Ltd. On March 18, 2019, the Company changed its jurisdiction from Nevada to Wyoming.

Led by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, an avid jeweler, the goal of the Company is to generate continuous, scalable and growing revenues from the sale of its diamond jewelry. The Company intends to regularly visit jewelry shows and other dealers throughout Asia.

Since December 1, 2021, the Company extended its retail distribution in China and delivered its precious stone products to a retailer on a consignment basis.  As more Chinese are buying luxury products like Jade - most popular precious stone, which has in recent years experienced a double digit growth. Demand for Jade is driven almost entirely by the Chinese market. At the top end of this kind of precious stone, it can be worth more than gold. Investment into raw stone can be a very good medium term buy sell process. Pandemic allow us to get better bargain on lot size inventory too.

We are in the early stages of developing our diamond jewelry business; accordingly, our operating history is limited. The Company holds inventory for its most popular diamond jewelry products, but not for all items it offers for sale. Most of the time, we procure our products from vendors after we have received an order from a customer. The Company has four vendors with whom it works who have previously and currently are able to supply whatever the company’s procurement needs are for products within a week. Assuming we are able to develop our business, our main products we wish to sell are loose diamonds, from emerald-cut to round-cut diamonds.

Our plan of operations over the next 12-month period is to continue developing our website to have a fully functioning online store and sell our diamond products.

Having locations in Hong Kong and China for the purposes of conveniently shipping products, the Company has the ability to export its inventory of diamonds and medals, to be sold in East Asia and around the world. Likewise, the Company also imports such products back to Hong Kong and China, to be sold throughout the local markets.

The Company adheres to strict processes related to acquisition and sale of its products. It begins by selecting the best inventory. All inventory is carefully screened by management, then sent to be graded by the proper grading authority. All of the Company’s diamonds are certified by the Gemological Institute of America.

We determine the price of a diamond according to the “4C” criteria:

Clarity: The most expensive diamond is the one that is absolutely clear in clarity, but many of them have inclusions (scratches or trace minerals) that can detract from the pure beauty of the diamond. Clarity has several categories that affect the price of a diamond: FL (Flawless, no internal/external flaws), VVS1, VVS2 (Very, Very Slightly Included, an excellent quality of diamond), VS1, VS2 (Very Slightly Included, not visible to the eye), S1, S2 (Slightly Included, may be visible to the eye), I1, I2, I3 (Included, the lowest grades of clarity). GOLD SHINY does not carry the last two clarity grades in its inventory.
Color: A diamond can divide light into a spectrum of colors, and reflect light as more or less colorful, depending on the color grade. The less color in a diamond, the better the color grade. Color grades are categorized into D (absolutely colorless, the highest color grade), E (colorless, only traces of color and only detected by gemologists), F (colorless, slight color detected, still a high quality diamond), G-H (near colorless, color noticeable, but still an excellent value), I-J (near colorless, color slightly detectable), K-M (low grade color), N-Z (low grade color). GOLD SHINY does not carry the last three color grades in its inventory to maintain a good selection of diamonds.
Cut: The roundness, depth, width and uniformity of the facets determine a diamond’s brilliance. Cut is the most important characteristic of a diamond; even with perfect color and clarity, a poor cut will affect its brilliance.
Carat: The weight of a diamond. In the engagement-ring market today, usually the “dowry” is around 1 carat and above.

We maintain an online store at fovea-jewellery.com for the sale of our diamonds and jewelry.  However, to better utilise the online platform, since 2021, we are in the process of upgrading the software application and logistics and expected to be available in 3rd or 4th quarter of 2022. Overseas resellers are the major resources for the sale an distribution of our products under travelling restrictions currently during 2021.
Competition

In the diamond and jewelry business, we compete with a number of comparably sized and smaller firms, as well as a number of larger firms throughout East Asia. Our primary competitors are small jewelry business, but large jewelry businesses are also be our competitors. Many of our competitors have the ability to attract customers as a result of their reputation and the quality diamond jewelry they obtain through their industry connections. Additionally, other reputable companies that sell jewelry, though not focused on diamond jewelry, may decide to enter our markets to compete with us. These companies have greater name recognition and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We will likely lose business to such companies.
Government Regulation and Approvals

We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for any of our services or products. We do not believe that we are subject to any government regulations relating to the ownership and licensing of our intellectual property.
Employees

As of the date hereof, we have 1 non-employee officer, Thomson Lee, who operates our company.
