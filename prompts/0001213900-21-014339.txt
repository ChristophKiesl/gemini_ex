Overview



PARTS iD, Inc. is a technology-driven, digital commerce company focused on creating custom infrastructure and unique user experiences within niche markets. The Company was founded in 2008 with a vision of creating a one-stop digital commerce destination for the automotive parts and accessories market. Management believes that the Company has since become a market leader and proven brand-builder, fueled by its commitment to delivering an engaging shopping experience; comprehensive, accurate and varied product offerings; and continued digital commerce innovation.



At its core, the Company’s technology solution is a data and information platform that enables and facilitates a differentiated digital commerce experience within complex product markets, as opposed to a pure digital commerce or electronics retailer. The deep technology platform that we have built integrates software engineering with catalog management, data intelligence, mining and analytics, along with user interface development that utilizes distinctive rules-based parts fitment software capabilities. In order to handle the ever-growing need for accurate automotive product and parts data, the Company has utilized cutting-edge computational and software engineering techniques, including Bayesian classification, to enhance and improve data records and product information and also deliver an engaging user experience. The technology platform also offers the Company fungibility, which was demonstrated by the fact that it was able to launch seven new verticals in August 2018.

Through the journey of building a comprehensive and complex product portfolio with over 17 million SKUs, as well as building an end-to-end digital commerce platform, the Company has developed a platform for both digital commerce and fulfillment, relying on insights gleaned from nearly 14 billion data points related to vehicle parts, a virtual shipping network comprising over 2,500 locations, nearly 5,000 active brands, and machine-learning algorithms for complex fitment industries such as vehicle parts and accessories.



While the Company’s platform has been initially focused on automotive parts and accessories, management believes the Company’s platform is scalable and can be applied to other complex, multi-dimensional fitment, product portfolio industries, in addition to the seven new parts and accessories verticals — semi truck, motorcycle, powersports, RV/camper, boating, recreation and tools — that we launched in August 2018.






The Company has positioned these verticals under its existing “iD” brand and believes this will drive brand loyalty among customers and reputation among vendors, ultimately increasing online traffic, brand visibility, and customer orders for adjacent markets. The Company has since experienced growth in revenue related to the new verticals, our original equipment (“OE”) business, and our repair parts business.



Customer service is a key aspect of the experience the Company offers to its customers throughout their buying journey. The Company has specialized customer support teams which assist customers in navigating through the platform, addressing any technical questions, order tracking and completing the order.



Digital Commerce Platform



The Company’s digital commerce platform was developed in-house from inception as a solution for industries with data limitations and parts fitment complexities, all while making processes simpler and more efficient. A core differentiator of the Company’s digital commerce platform is its purpose-built and proprietary data catalog developed over more than a decade by collecting, analyzing and refining data regarding original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, vehicles and aftermarket products and customer feedback to define a universe of accurate Year-Make-Model, or YMM, values. Management believes this functionality creates a unique user experience path that drives purchase intelligence and increases consumer confidence and trust.

The Company’s in-house data catalog houses nearly 14 billion data points for automobiles and the Company’s other seven verticals. This data catalog is designed to tie vehicles with parts that fit their specific YMM, including the variations of sub-model, engine size, transmission type and drivetrain type, as well as to recommend complementary products, such as tools required to install purchased parts and accessories. To build its catalog, the Company aggregates data from multiple sources, cross-pollinates this data to address any gaps in data sets, enriches the catalog using its proprietary internal data, then applies artificial intelligence to make further improvements. Through this process, the Company’s data catalog is able to: (i) determine the exact parts fitment for a product by its parameters, even if certain fitment details are originally missing in manufacturers’ data feeds; and (ii) rapidly incorporate new SKUs as they become available. Because its data catalog is continually expanding with each customer interaction, the Company also is able to offer better purchase recommendations, increase up-sell opportunities, improve the efficiency of its fulfillment operations, and lower errors and mistakes in orders. These economic and commercial advantages result in a fly-wheel effect that increases operating leverage and momentum. Because the cost of operating the Company’s data catalog is largely fixed, the Company has been able to expand its customer offerings into adjacent categories at relatively low incremental costs. The Company’s in-house catalog and deep understanding of fitment data helps offer a personalized and tailored experience to its diverse customer base of DIY, DIFM and PRO (mechanics) customers. For example, the Company can offer its DIFM consumers the ability to research and choose from a wide variety of tires, and in the same transaction select a tire installation center (2,117 locations available as of February 28, 2021) near them and schedule an appointment. The Company is committed to providing an enhanced customer experience and becoming a one-stop shop and seamless solution for all vehicle enthusiast needs.



Product Vendors



The Company provides its product vendors with access to its large customer base and e-commerce market. The Company’s 1000+ product vendors can leverage the Company’s disruptive technology, enhanced fitment data, deep understanding of the market and large customer database to sell and position their innovative product catalog instantly. Product vendors can benefit from the Company’s engaging shopping experience, advanced 3D imagery, in-depth product description, reviews, installation guides and other tailored content offered by the Company’s platform, complemented by specialized customer service.
Fulfillment Operations



The Company’s virtual, proprietary and capital-efficient fulfillment model manages our sales volume while carrying minimal inventory, which is primarily associated with its private label products. The Company’s platform, which incorporates live or frequently updated inventory feeds from our product vendors, provides stock-on-hand for more than 17 million products across nearly 5,000 brands. The Company’s fulfillment model decides which product vendor to source from while the sale is made based on a proprietary algorithm, which incorporates factors such as availability of inventory, customer proximity, shipping cost and profitability.



This decentralized, data-driven approach allows the Company to increase delivery speed through more than 2,500 shipping points from its U.S. vendor network.



Products



The Company primarily sells automotive parts and accessories, including a wide range of goods from automobile accessories, wheels and tires, performance parts, lighting and repair parts. In addition, the Company launched seven new verticals in August 2018 and, in 2020, the value of the orders received from these new verticals grew to approximately 10% of the Company’s total order value. These seven new verticals offer parts and accessories for semi-trucks, motorcycles, powersports (including ATVs, snowmobiles and personal watercraft), RVs/campers, boats, recreation (including outdoor sports and camping gear) and tools using the same proprietary platform.



The Company primarily sources its products from industry leading brands and product vendors located in the U.S., except that its private label products are largely sourced from foreign product vendors. Regarding sales of products sourced from our product vendors, no single product vendor accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company’s inventory on hand, which largely relates to private label products, has generally remained below $1.0 million in value. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the sale value of customers’ unshipped and undelivered orders were $16.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively.



Private Label Product. The Company’s private label business uses proprietary data to identify, import and sell higher margin products that are in demand on its platform. Management believes that by selecting and pairing a superior import product with its purpose-built and proprietary data catalog, consumers are provided the option to purchase a high-quality product at a reasonable cost. Private label revenue was less than 10% of the Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Branded Product. The Company has developed and implemented application-programming interfaces with the majority of its drop-ship product vendors that allow it to electronically transmit orders, check inventory availability, and receive the shipment tracking information and share it with its customers. These processes allow the Company to offer nearly 5,000 brands on an inventory-free basis, thereby reducing carrying costs and improving margins.



Industry and Market Opportunity



The Company’s management believes the U.S. aftermarket automotive market is massive, fragmented, and ripe for disruption as overall consumer preferences are increasingly shifting to online transactions. Although the ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain and consumer demand for automobile parts and accessories may be impacted in a recessionary environment, a recent survey published by Capgemini SE, a consulting corporation, found that 46% of U.S. adults surveyed plan to use their cars more often and public transportation less often in the future. Additionally, the pandemic is accelerating trends of online shopping more broadly as consumers seek to avoid physical retail locations.



In 2020, the domestic automotive aftermarket market opportunity was estimated to be approximately $392 billion. The Company has historically focused on the $46 billion specialty automotive equipment market, but is seeking to accelerate its growth through automotive repairs, targeted international expansion and the addition of new verticals. The Company’s other product verticals present an aggregate market opportunity exceeding $120 billion in 2020.






Marketing



Management believes its customers’ core need is to find the right parts that fit their vehicle at the best price and are delivered on time. Our marketing strategies are designed around customer acquisition and retention which includes paid and non-paid advertising. Our paid advertising primarily includes search engine marketing, display, paid social media, connected TV (CTV) and paid partnerships. Our non-paid advertising efforts include search engine optimization, non-paid social media and e-mail marketing.

The Company currently drives traffic to its platform primarily with search engines; 77% of the Company’s traffic and 66% of its revenue in 2020 was acquired in this manner. Once on the platform, customers are presented with the Company’s proprietary marketing and product content that is created via in-house, multi-step image and video processing. Automated image refinement and the Company’s creative design team work to ensure consistency and quality across all content, including the product images presented to customers on the Company’s platform. Product pages on the Company’s platform present customers with multiple, customized product choices, plus cross-sell and up-sell opportunities, as well as training materials, product comparison information, installation instructions and customer reviews. Customers have the option to shop and explore on the Company’s platform in multiple ways, including by part number, brand or product category.



Competition



The parts and accessories industries in which the Company sells its products are competitive and fragmented, and products are distributed through multi-tiered and overlapping channels. The Company competes with both online and offline sellers that offer parts and accessories, repair parts and OEM parts to either the DIY or the DIFM consumer groups. Current or potential competitors include (i) online retailers, including both niche retailers of uncommon, highly specialized products and general retailers of a larger number of broadly available products; (ii) national parts retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, NAPA and O’Reilly Auto Parts; (iii) internet-based marketplaces such as Amazon.com and eBay.com; (iv) discount stores and mass merchandisers; (v) local independent retailers; (vi) wholesale parts distributors and (vii) manufacturers, product vendors and other distributors selling online directly to consumers. The Company faces significant competition from these and other retailers in the United States and abroad. The majority of these competitors are, and will be, substantially larger than the Company, and have substantially greater resources and operating histories. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to keep pace with the technological or product developments of its competitors. These companies also compete with the Company in recruiting and retaining highly qualified technical and professional personnel and consultants.



Competitive factors in the markets the Company serves include fitment data and related intelligence, technology, customer experience, customer service, range of product offerings, product availability, product quality, price and shipping speed. Management believes its custom-built tech-stack for the complex, multi-dimensional automotive parts and accessories industry, which offers nearly 5,000 brands and more than 17 million unique SKUs, provides it with a unique competitive advantage.



Intellectual Property



The Company owns a number of trade names, service marks and trademarks, including “iD,” “CARiD,” “BOATiD,” “MOTORCYCLEiD,” “CAMPERiD,” “POWERSPORTSiD,” “TOOLSiD,” “TRUCKiD,” “RECREATIONiD” and more, for use in connection with its business. In addition, the Company owns and has registered trademarks for certain of its private label brands. Management believes these trade names, service marks and trademarks are important to the Company’s sales and marketing strategy.

Environmental Matters



The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of its business, including those governing the use and transportation of hazardous substances and emissions-related standards, established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and similar state-level regulators, including the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”).



While the Company has processes in place to ensure that products are sold in compliance with the requirements imposed by the EPA and similar state-level regulators, all verification processes have inherent limitations. The Company has been, is currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory proceedings initiated by the EPA, CARB or other applicable regulatory bodies, and the results of such proceedings are uncertain. For additional information, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Although management believes that the Company is in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws, rules, and regulations, it is unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future laws, rules, and regulations on its business, properties or products. Such laws, rules, or regulations may cause the Company to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, may require it to modify its product offerings, may adversely affect the price of or demand for some of its products, and may ultimately affect the way the Company conducts its operations. Failure to comply with these current or future laws, rules, or regulations could result in harm to the Company’s reputation and/or could lead to fines and other penalties, including restrictions on the importation of the Company’s products into, or the sale of its products in, one or more jurisdictions until compliance is achieved.



Seasonality



The Company’s revenue is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, although sales typically spike during the spring months upon the distribution to the general public by the IRS of income tax refunds and during the winter holiday season. While the Company expects to be able to maintain sales growth through seasonality, it recognizes that future revenues may be affected by these seasonal trends as well as cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, especially the automotive parts and accessories industry.
Employees



As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed 108 full-time employees, all in the United States. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union, and management believes that the Company’s relations with its employees are good.



Certain call center, development, and back-office services are provided by independent contractors in Ukraine, Belarus, Philippines and Costa Rica.
