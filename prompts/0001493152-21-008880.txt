ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Vinco Ventures: End-to-end product innovation, development, and commercialization
 
Our Company was incorporated on July 18, 2017 in the State of Nevada under the name of Idea Lab X Products, Inc, On September 12, 2017, we filed an Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing the name to Xspand Products Lab, Inc., and then on September 7, 2018 we filed an Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing the name to Edison Nation, Inc. On November 5, 2020, the Company (the “Parent”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Vinco Ventures, Inc. (the “Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”). Under the terms of the Agreement, the Merger Sub merged with and into the Parent and the Parent became the surviving corporation of the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”). The name of the Surviving Corporation became Vinco Ventures, Inc. The transaction closed on November 10, 2020.
 
Vinco Ventures, Inc. seeks to be involved with every step of the consumer product life cycle – from ideation, to research and development, manufacturing, sales, packaging and fulfillment. The Company also seeks to raise awareness of the Vinco Ventures brand name as a diversified consumer products business through a number of media channels.
 
The first stage of development for any consumer product is the impetus to turn an idea into a salable commodity. Considered to be the “go-to” resource for independent innovators with great consumer product invention ideas, Vinco Ventures through its Edison Nation web portal maintains a consumer-facing online presence whereby innovators can submit ideas for consideration by us. If an idea is successfully chosen, Vinco Ventures will apply its proprietary, web-enabled new product development (“NPD”) and commercialization platform that can take a product from idea through final e-commerce sale. Vinco Ventures presently engages with over 180,000 registered online innovators and entrepreneurs interested in accessing the Company’s NPD platform to bring innovative, new products to market focusing on high-interest, high-velocity consumer categories. The Company generates revenue from its web presence by charging a fee for each idea submission, and also through subscription-based plans for innovators that wish to submit high volumes of ideas.
 
Since its inception, the Edison Nation web portal has received over 200,000 idea submissions, with products selling in excess of $250 million at retail through the management of over 300 client product campaigns with distribution across diverse channels including e-commerce, mass merchandisers, specialty product chains, entertainment venues, national drug chains, and tele-shopping. These clients include many of the largest manufacturers and retailers in the world including Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, HSN, Rite Aid, P&G, and Black & Decker. The Company generates revenue from licensing agreements with such manufacturers and retailers. Such agreements are entered into when innovators submit their ideas through Vinco Ventures’ web portal. Occasionally, the Company also generates revenue from innovators that wish to use the Company’s product development resources, but license or distribute products themselves.
 
Vinco Ventures has a number of internally developed brands (“EN Brands”) which act as a launchpad for new innovative items that have matriculated through the innovation portal. These EN Brands include Cloud B, Pirasta, Uber Mom, Lily and Grey, Trillion Trees, and Barkley Lane. Additionally, the Company offers a partnership model for entrepreneurs and businesses that are seeking to elevate their existing brands. Recent partnerships for Vinco Ventures include 4Keeps Roses and Mother K. Within the partnership model, the Company seeks to identify new lines of distribution and provide innovation through development of new item that enhance the brands overall image and consumer adoption.
 
Once most consumer products are ideated, developed, manufactured, and possibly even licensed, they must be packaged and distributed. Currently, we maintain a logistics center in Clearwater, Florida. The Company generates revenue from the sale of custom packaging for many of the products that have run through our NPD or in-house product development process. The Company also sells packaging products to a number of other entities that are not related to the Company’s product development process, including pharmaceutical and e-commerce companies. For packaging products, the Company does not have long-term agreements with customers, and instead manufactures and sells its packaging products subject to purchase orders from its customers.
 
Once a product is ready for distribution, consumer awareness must be raised in order to sell the product. Accordingly, the Company has begun to pursue a media strategy. First, the Company is seeking to re-release episodes of the ‘Everyday Edisons’ television program, while simultaneously seeking a distribution partner for forthcoming episodes. The Company intends to generate revenue from the Everyday Edisons brand by entering into a contract with a broadcast network or online streaming service. The Company is seeking to expand its web presence by acquiring or creating other innovator-facing internet media properties. The Company intends to generate revenue from such internet media through the display of paid advertisements on its properties.

Market Strategy
 
The process for developing and launching consumer products has changed significantly in recent years. Previously, Fortune 500 and other companies maintained multimillion-dollar research and development divisions to develop and launch products to be sold primarily on retail shelves and supported by large television and print advertising investment. The emergence of e-commerce giants, including Amazon.com, has caused retail shelf space to no longer be a requirement to launch a new product. Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter enable solo entrepreneurs to inexpensively produce an advertising video and quickly introduce a new product to millions of potential customers, and to quickly gain those customers for a low cost of acquisition relative to the cost and time required in prior years as expensive traditional advertising investment is no longer required to gain market awareness. For example, according to Statista.com, crowdfunded sales of products will exceed $18.9 billion in 2021. The consumer shift away from brick and mortar retailers toward e-commerce has resulted in the bankruptcy or downsizing of many iconic retailers which sold toys, including Toys R Us, Sears, Kmart, and K-B Toys, with the resultant loss in shelf space and available locations helping to drive our market opportunity. By utilizing the opportunities to market products over the internet, rather than through traditional, commercial channels, we believe we can reach a much broader market for our brands and products.
Leveraging Evolving Market Opportunities for Growth
 
The Company believes that its anticipated growth will be driven by six macroeconomic factors:
 

● | The significant growth of ecommerce (Up 32.4% in 2020 versus 2019 (eMarketer 2020)); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The increasing velocity of “brick and mortar” retail closures; 
● | Product innovation and immediate delivery gratification driving consumer desire for next-generation products with distinctive sets of features and benefits without a reliance on brand awareness and familiarity; 
● | The marriage of media-based entertainment and consumer goods 
● | The rapid adoption of crowdsourcing to expedite successful new product launches; and 
● | The opportunity to market products over the internet and television, rather than through traditional, commercial channels, to reach a much broader, higher qualified target market for brands, and products. 

 
In addition, we intend to acquire more small brands that have achieved approximately $1 million in retail sales over the trailing twelve-month period with a track record of generating free cash flow. By leveraging our expertise in helping companies launch thousands of new products and our ability to create unique, customized packaging, we will seek to elevate the value of these acquired brands by improving each part of their launch process, based on our own marketing methodologies.
 
We believe our acquisition strategy will allow us to acquire small brands using a combination of shares of our common stock, cash and other consideration, such as earn-outs. We intend to use our acquisition strategy in order to acquire up to ten or more small brands per year for the next three years. In situations where we deem that a brand is not a “fit” for acquisition or partnership, we may provide the brand with certain manufacturing or consulting services that will assist the brand to achieve its goals.
 
On November 30, 2020, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, SRM Entertainment, LTD entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement with Jupiter Wellness, Inc. (“Jupiter”). Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Jupiter agreed to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock (the “Exchange Shares”) issued by SRM from the Company. As consideration for the purchase of the Exchange Shares, Jupiter issued the Company 200,000 shares of its restricted common stock, symbol JUPW as listed on NASDAQ Capital Markets. The Company made the decision to divest the amusement park business due to the slow re-openings of amusement parks around the world and the investment that would have been needed to remain open and the investment required to relaunch as the amusement parks begin to get back to full capacity. Please see Note 18 — Discontinued Operations for further information.

One Company Initiative
 
During 2020, the Company had three distinct business units, which allows the Company to focus on growing sales and leveraging operations. The units consist of:


● Innovate. The Vinco Ventures New Product Development (“NPD”) platform helps inventors go from idea to reality. This is accomplished by optimizing the Company’s new product election process through deeper analytics to predict success on platforms like crowdfunding and web marketplaces like Amazon. The Company drives brand awareness of the platform by producing content for inventors and innovators on media platforms including our own Everyday Edison’s television show.
 
● Build and Launch. Distributed by geography, industry skillset and expertise in the development process to ensure efficient product build and launch our teams of product designers and developers take the product from the concept to the consumers’ hand. The bulk of the Company’s operations are part of this business unit, and the Company will continue to develop this unit to meet the needs of our product launch schedule.
 
● Sell. Our omni-channel sales effort is divided into three groups: (1) business-to-business revenue opportunities including traditional brick and mortar retailers, (2) online marketplaces and direct-to-consumer revenue opportunities, and (3) our NiTRO Team (Near Term Revenue Opportunities). NiTRO, identifies brands and products lines that would benefit from being part of Vinco Ventures.
 
In November 2020, in connection with the name change and startup of Honey Badger, the Company set a path for new key fundamentals in their strategy. Vinco Ventures, Inc. plans to leverage the new market opportunity by utilizing their B.I.G. Strategy: Buy. Innovate. Grow.
 
● Buy. Acquisitions is our model. We will seek to acquire significant brands to continue to add to the Portfolio.
 
● Innovate. – Leverage the internal traffic platforms of Honey Badger, our brands are able to quickly innovate and determine the highest conversion traffic and target accordingly. Once identified, we scale while maintaining conversions for success.
 
● Grow. More targeted traffic equals more conversions. With our internal engines, we are able to expedite growth of our acquired brands to reach their target numbers quicker.


Innovate: The Vinco Ventures New Product Development & Commercialization Platform
 
New product ideas have little value without the ability and skill required to commercialize them. The considerable investment and executional “know how” needed to initiate a process - from idea to product distribution - has always been a challenge for the individual innovator. Vinco Ventures’ web presence is designed to take advantage of online marketplace and crowdfunding momentum for our future growth mitigating new product development risk while allowing for optimized product monetization based on a product’s likelihood to succeed. To that end, Vinco Ventures empowers and enables innovators and entrepreneurs to develop and launch products, gain consumer adoption and achieve commercial scale efficiently at little to no cost.
 
The cornerstone of Vinco Ventures’ competitive advantage is its NPD platform, which is designed to optimize product licensing and commercialization through best-in-class digital technologies, sourcing / manufacturing expertise and one of the largest sets of go-to-market solutions. The NPD platform can take a product from idea through ecommerce final sale in a matter of months versus a year or more for capital intensive and inefficient new product development protocols traditionally used by legacy manufacturers serving “big box” retailers.
 
Product Submission Aggregation
 
Interested innovators enter the Vinco Ventures web site to register for a free account by providing their name and email address. The member then creates a username and password to use on the site. Once registered, the member is provided with their own unique, password protected dashboard by which they can begin submitting ideas and join online member forums to learn about industry trends, common questions, engage in member chats, and stay informed of the latest happenings at Vinco Ventures. They can also track the review progress of ideas they submit through their dashboard.
 
Vinco Ventures accepts ideas through a secure online submission process. Once a member explores the active searches in different product categories being run on the platform for potential licensees seeking new product ideas to be commercialized, the member can submit their new product ideas for processing. Vinco Ventures regularly works with different companies and retailers in various product categories to help them find new product ideas.
 
Registered members pay $25 to submit an idea. This submission fee covers a portion of the cost to review each idea submitted to the platform. There are no additional fees after the submission fee.


Although the platform might not have an active search that matches the innovator’s idea, the Vinco Ventures licensing team hosts an ongoing search for new consumer product ideas in all categories.
 
“Insider Membership” is Vinco Ventures’ premium level of membership. Members that are insiders (“Insiders”) receive feedback on all their ideas submitted and gain access to online features that aren’t available to registered members. In addition, Insiders pay $20 for each idea submitted (20% discount vs. a registered member), can opt-in ideas for free, as well as receive other benefits. An annual membership costs $99, or $9.25 / month automatically debited from a credit card each month. Also included online is feedback to the innovator on the status of each stage of the process and notification when ideas are not selected to move forward during any stage in the review process.
 
Insiders also have access to the Insider Licensing Program (the “ILP”). The primary benefit of the ILP is having the Vinco Ventures licensing team working directly on an innovator’s behalf to help secure a licensing agreement with one of the company’s manufacturing partners. If an idea is selected for commercialization by a retail partner, Vinco Ventures will invest in any necessary patent applications, filings and maintenance. The innovator’s name is included on any patent or patent application that Vinco Ventures files on the member’s behalf after the idea has been selected.

In addition to the above member programs, Vinco Ventures ASOTV (“As Seen on TV”) Team hosts a search for new products suitable for marketing via DRTV (“Direct Response TV”) and subsequent distribution in national retail chains including mass merchandisers, specialty retail, drug chains and department stores.
 
Product Submission Review
 
Led by the Company’s licensing team (which has over 150 years of combined experience in a variety of industries and product categories), all ideas submitted by innovators through the Company’s website are reviewed and assessed through an 8-stage process. Vinco Ventures’ product idea review process is confidential with non-disclosure agreements executed with every participating registered or “Insider” member.
 

The NPD platform’s database of over 85,000 product ideas helps determine which inventions have a substantial market opportunity quickly through proprietary algorithms that have been developed incorporating continuous learning from marketplace experience and changes in category requirements.
 
Selected ideas are assessed by the licensing team based on nine key factors: competing products, uniqueness, retail pricing, liability & safety, marketability, manufacturing cost, patentability, consumer relevant features and benefits, and commercialization.
 
The time required to review ideas depends upon different variables, such as: the number of searches concurrently running on Vinco Ventures platform, idea volume and complexity of the search, how many presentation dates to licensees are pending, the date an idea is submitted.
 
Presentation dates to potential licensees are usually set a few weeks following the close of the search. After the presentation has been given to a licensing / retail partner, the partner has 45 days to 6 months to select ideas on which they will move forward.
 
The ILP incorporates a four-stage process:
 

● | Stage #1 — Preliminary Review: The licensing team performs a preliminary review to ensure an invention meets the program criteria. Factors that might stall an idea from moving forward include: an invention is cost-prohibitive, has engineering challenges, and/or major players in the marketplace have already launched products like it. If none of these apply, an idea will be approved and move on to the preparation phase. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Stage #2 — Preparation: The licensing team performs a best partner review. Vinco Ventures’ retail and manufacturing contacts are assessed, and the team begins to plan which licensors would be the best fit for an idea. A gap analysis and visits the store shelves are executed to gain greater understanding of marketplace potential. 
● | Stage #3 — Pitching: At this phase, an idea can become a “Finalist.” The licensing team begins to proactively pitch an idea to potential licensees using a proprietary presentation system. When a company expresses interest, the team proceeds into term sheets and negotiations while staying in constant contact with the prospect until the best possible deal is struck for the innovator. 
● | Stage #4 — Outcome: In the end, the market decides what products will be successful. There are no guarantees. If for some reason Vinco Ventures is not successful in finding a licensing partner, a complete debrief is given to the Insider.

Due to the public nature of licensing, Vinco Ventures only accepts ideas from Insiders that are patented or patent-pending. A valid provisional patent application is required. The cost of submitting an idea to the ILP is $100, and a member must be an “Insider” to be considered.
 
The Vinco Ventures ASOTV new product development process follows a six-stage protocol appropriate for the broadcast-based sales channel. For more information regarding the ASOTV process, the Vinco Ventures NPD platform, its features and member benefits, visit https://app.edisonnation.com/faq.
 
Acquisition of Intellectual Property
 
Once an innovator’s idea is judged to be a potentially viable, commercial product and selected for potential commercialization, the Company acquires intellectual property rights from the innovator.
 
Once an innovator’s intellectual property is secured, the innovator’s product idea can then either be licensed to a manufacturer or retailer or developed and marketed directly by Vinco Ventures. In either case, Vinco Ventures serves as the point-of-contact with the innovator for term sheets, royalty negotiation and concluding licensing agreements. Vinco Ventures also maintains contact with the innovator to keep them engaged during product development.
 
In general, innovators are paid a percentage of the Company’s revenue from the commercialization of the innovator’s intellectual property. This percentage varies with the Company’s investment in the development of the intellectual property, including whether the Company decides to license the innovator’s idea for commercialization or instead, to directly develop and market the innovator’s idea.
 
Build and Launch: Product Design and Development
 
With product design, product prototyping and creation of marketing assets all resourced with expert Vinco Ventures in-house capabilities, we have made protracted, high-cost, high-risk research and development models obsolete.
 
Vinco Ventures custom designs most products in-house for specific customers and their needs. We utilize our existing tooling to produce samples and prototypes for customer reviews, refinement and approval, as well as our in-house packaging design and fabrication resources.
 
The Company’s design and product development professionals are dedicated to the commercialization and marketability of new product concepts advanced through the company’s NPD platform and for licensors / partners like Disney World and Universal Studios.
 
No matter the product, Vinco Ventures’ objective is to optimize its marketability, function, value and appearance for the benefit of the consumer end user. From concept and prototyping, through design-for-manufacture, special attention is paid to a product’s utility, ease of use, lowest cost bill of materials, and how it “communicates” its features and benefits through design.
 
The combined experience and expertise of the Company’s team spans many high-demand categories including household items, small appliances, kitchenware, and toys. The Company’s in-house capabilities are complimented by third-party engineering and prototyping contractors, and category-specific expert resources within select manufacturers.
 
Manufacturing, Materials, and Logistics
 
To provide greater flexibility in the manufacturing and delivery of products, and as part of a continuing effort to reduce manufacturing costs, Vinco Ventures has concentrated production of most of the Company’s products in third-party manufacturers located in China and Hong Kong. The Company maintains a fully staffed Hong Kong office for sourcing, overseeing manufacturing and quality assurance.


Vinco Ventures utilizes a variety of contracted manufacturing facilities to supply a majority of its products. The Company continues to explore more efficient and expert manufacturing partners to gain greater economies of scale, potential consolidation, and cost savings on an on-going basis.
 
Products are also purchased from unrelated enterprises with specific expertise in the design, development, and manufacture those specialty products.
 
We base our production schedules on customer orders and forecasts, considering historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Actual shipments of ordered products and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory in a product line.

Most of our raw materials are available from numerous suppliers but may be subject to fluctuations in price.
 
Sell: Paths to Market
 
Vinco Ventures partners with many of the biggest and most well-known online entities, consumer products companies and retailers. They use the Company’s platform as a “think engine” to develop targeted products, significantly reduce research and development expense, and expedite time to market.
 
Each potential licensee of an innovator’s idea publishes an exclusive page on the Vinco Ventures web site with innovation goals and timeline for their search. Appropriate new product ideas are submitted in 100% confidence with all intellectual property safely guarded.
 
Once the search concludes, Vinco Ventures presents each potential licensee with the best patent protected, or patentable ideas that can be selected for development.
 
Licensing partners and customers include Amazon, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Church & Dwight, Black & Decker, HSN, Worthington Industries, Pampered Chef, Boston America Corp., Walmart, Target, PetSmart, “As Seen on TV,” Sunbeam, Home Depot, and Apothecary Products.
 
Online Marketplace and Crowdfunding
 
Vinco Ventures has established a commercialization path to include the development and management of crowdfunding campaigns. This is evolving to be a engine for future growth. The benefits of crowdfunding include increased product testing efficiency, decreased financial risk, and the ability to get closer to the end consumer, simultaneously.
 
The ability for consumers to re-order product not only gauges marketplace demand, but it can also be leveraged as a quantitative “proof point” for potential sales to licensees. Most importantly, the money pledged for orders can be used to finance manufacturing and ecommerce launch marketing costs as negative working capital.
 
Sales, Marketing, and Advertising
 
Our Omni-channel sales effort is divided into three groups: (1) business-to-business revenue opportunities including traditional brick and mortar retailers, (2) online marketplaces and direct-to-consumer revenue opportunities, and (3) our NiTRO Team (Near Term Revenue Opportunities). NiTRO, identifies brands and products lines that would benefit from being part of Vinco Ventures.
 
Vinco Ventures’ business to business team sells products through a diverse network of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. New customer prospects are gained through outbound sales calls, trade show participation, web searches, referrals from existing customers.
 
The online team for the company has expertise in selling products on platforms such as the Amazon marketplace as well as portals like Walmart.com and “crowd-funded” websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo.
 
The NiTRO team identifies small, unique brands that could benefit from becoming part of a larger consumer products organization with more resources. The team seeks to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement whereby the respective branded products become part of Vinco Ventures’ portfolio of consumer products.
 
Media Strategy
 
In order to expand the Company’s universe of registered innovators and entrepreneurs submitting ideas on the Vinco Ventures NPD web platform, the Company has entered a global agreement for distribution of two existing 13-episode seasons of the Company’s Everyday Edison TV series with a leading digital media service company. The series will be available in its original English version as well as voiceover adaptations in German, French, and Spanish. Distribution is planned for Europe and the Middle East through digital content providers such as Amazon Prime Video.
Sources of Revenue
 
The Company aggressively pursues six sources of sales volume:
 

● | Our branded products sold through traditional retail channels of distribution and other channels of business to business distribution; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our branded products sold through direct to consumer platforms such as the Amazon marketplace as well as portals like Walmart.com; 
● | Member idea submission and ILP program fees: $25 per submission (registered members); $20 per submission (Insider members); $100 per submission (ILP members); 
● | Licensing agents: We match an innovator’s intellectual property with vertical product category leaders in a licensing structure whereby the innovator can earn up to 50% of the contracted licensing fee. Product categories include kitchenware, small appliances, toys, pet care, baby products, health & beauty aids, entertainment venue merchandise, and housewares; and 
● | Product principals: We work with innovators directly, providing such innovators direct access to all of Vinco Ventures’ resources. Depending on case-by-case factors, innovators may receive a range of up to 35% - 50% of profits.

Market Overview
 
The process for developing and launching consumer products has changed significantly in recent years. Previously, Fortune 500 and specialty consumer product companies funded multimillion-dollar NPD divisions to develop and launch products. These products were sold primarily on “big box” retail shelves supported by large marketing investments.
 
The emergence of ecommerce giants, including Amazon and Walmart.com, has disrupted traditional NPD and commercialization paths and has accelerated a consumer shift away from “brick and mortar” retailers. The result has been the bankruptcy or downsizing of many iconic retailers, including Toys R Us, JC Penney, Macy’s, Sears, Kmart, Office Depot, Family Dollar, and K-B Toys, with a commensurate loss of shelf space and accessible locations.
 
Moreover, crowdfunding sites, like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, have also disrupted NPD process cycles and are now “mainstream.” In fact, as of October 2018, Kickstarter’s cumulative pledged funding exceeded $3.9 billion according to Kickstarter published data. Statista.com estimates that crowdfunded sales of products will exceed $18.9 billion by 2021.
 
These crowdfunding sites have enabled individual innovators and entrepreneurs to design, prototype and market unique products to millions of potential customers with significantly lower acquisition costs when compared to the capital and time required by legacy NPD processes.
 
COVID-19
 
COVID-19 has caused and continues to cause significant loss of life and disruption to the global economy, including the curtailment of activities by businesses and consumers in much of the world as governments and others seek to limit the spread of the disease, and through business and transportation shutdowns and restrictions on people’s movement and congregation.
 
As a result of the pandemic, we have experienced, and continue to experience, weakened demand for our traditional products. Many of our customers have been unable to sell our products in their stores due to government-mandated closures and have deferred or significantly reduced orders for our products. We expect these trends to continue until such closures are significantly curtailed or lifted. In addition, the pandemic has reduced foot traffic in the stores where our products are sold that remain open, and the global economic impact of the pandemic has temporarily reduced consumer demand for our products as they focus on purchasing essential goods.
 
In the United States and Asia, many of our key accounts remain closed or are operating at significantly reduced volumes. As a result, we have made the strategic decision to expand our operations through our Edison Nation Medical (“Ed Med”) division. Through Ed Med, the Company wholesales Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) products through an online portal for hospitals, government agencies and distributors.
 
Given these factors, the Company anticipates that the greatest impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020 occurred in the first quarter of 2020 resulting in a significant net sales decline as compared to the first quarter of 2019.
 
In addition, certain of our suppliers and the manufacturers of certain of our products were adversely impacted by COVID-19. As a result, we faced delays or difficulty sourcing products, which negatively affected our business and financial results. Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products, they may cost more and cause delays in our supply chain, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.
 
We have taken actions to protect our employees in response to the pandemic, including closing our corporate offices and requiring our office employees to work from home. At our distribution centers, certain practices are in effect to safeguard workers, including a staggered work schedule, and we are continuing to monitor direction from local and national governments carefully. Additionally, our two retail locations have been closed until further notice.

As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our financial results, and the anticipated future impact of the pandemic, we implemented cost control measures and cash management actions during 2020, including:
 
● Furloughing a significant portion of our employees in the first quarter of 2020;
 
● Implementing 20% salary reductions across our executive team and other members of upper-level management in the first and second quarter of 2020;
 
● Executing reductions in operating expenses, planned inventory levels and non-product development capital expenditures throughout 2020; and
 
● Proactively managing working capital, including reducing incoming inventory to align with anticipated sales.
 
Leveraging Evolving Market Opportunities for Growth
 
The Company believes that its anticipated growth will be driven by five macro factors including:
 

● | The significant growth of ecommerce (Up 32.4% in 2020 versus 2019 (eMarketer 2020)); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The increasing velocity of “brick and mortar” retail closures; 
● | Product innovation and immediate delivery gratification driving consumer desire for next-generation products with distinctive sets of features and benefits without a reliance on brand awareness and familiarity; 
● | The marriage of media-based entertainment and consumer goods; 
● | The rapid adoption of crowdsourcing to expedite successful new product launches; and 
● | The opportunity to market products over the internet and television, rather than through traditional, commercial channels, to reach a much broader, higher qualified target market for brands, and products. 



In addition, we believe that by leveraging our expertise in helping companies launch thousands of new products and our ability to create unique, customized packaging, we intend to acquire small brands that have achieved approximately $1 million in retail sales over the trailing twelve-month period with a track record of generating free cash flow. In addition, we will seek to elevate the value of these acquired brands by improving each part of their launch process, based on our own marketing methodologies.
 
We believe our acquisition strategy will allow us to acquire small brands using a combination of shares of our common stock, cash and other consideration, such as earn-outs. We intend to use our acquisition strategy in order to acquire ten or more small brands per year for the next three years. In situations where we deem that a brand is not a “fit” for acquisition or partnership, we may provide the brand with certain manufacturing or consulting services that will assist the brand to achieve its goals.

Competition and Industry Background
 
In terms of the Company’s consumer products business, competition is intensifying due to trends towards shorter life cycles for the development, production and marketability of consumer products. Competition is also intensifying due to the availability of online-only distributors, including Amazon.com, which can promote a wide variety of consumer products and represent a wide variety of manufacturers at low cost and limited overhead.
 
Vinco Ventures’ competitive set includes other online inventor platforms (e.g., InventHelp, Quirky, Mako Design + Invent, Davison, and Invention City). Each of these companies operate different types of business models that combine different consulting, development and service fees, and royalty structures.
 
Vinco Ventures was originally founded by the creators of the Emmy Award winning PBS television show, Everyday Edisons. One of the original founders, Louis Freeman, is currently a member of the Vinco Ventures board of directors. The Company’s model differs significantly from others in the inventor space in that it assumes the considerable financial risk, manpower and time required to monetize a product, from concept selection through sale. A portion of the commercialized product’s net profit is shared with the inventor through a variety of forms of licensing agreements.
 
The Company also competes with large manufacturing companies who develop and commercialize their own products in categories in which Vinco Ventures currently participates. However, we also are increasing the Company’s “co-op-etition” footprint with companies, like Black & Decker, who not only compete in product development but also have become active “cooperative” participants on the Vinco Ventures online innovation platform.
 
Customers
 
We sell our products to a diverse network of customers. Domestically, we sell our products to specialty retailers, mass-market retailers and e-commerce sites. Internationally, we sell our products directly to similar retailers and distributors.
 
One customer represented 7% and 14% of our revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that Vinco Ventures’ intellectual property rights have significant value in the marketplace, and that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, that we must continue to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property.
 
We seek protection on our products in as many countries as practical, through registered trademarks, copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available, cost effective and valuable to our products and brands. We also rely on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement which relate to our business.
 
Although we believe we are sufficiently protected, the failure to obtain or the loss of some of these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The consumer products business is highly seasonal with consumers making a large percentage of purchases during the traditional holiday season.
 
These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to our business associated with the underproduction of popular consumer products and the overproduction of less popular consumer products that do not match consumer demand.
 
These factors increase the risk that the Company may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that our own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. Additionally, as retailers manage their inventories, we may experience cyclical ordering patterns for products and product lines that may cause our sales to vary significantly from period to period.
 
E-commerce has partially reduced traditional seasonality to moderate seasonality. We intend to expand this flattening of traditional seasonality from e-commerce channels to our business as well, including through the continued emergence of crowd-funded “micro brands” that we believe will further delink demand for our products and services from historical demand fluctuation.
