ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Our Company 
 With a history dating back to 1886, American Water Works Company, Inc. is a holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936. Through its subsidiaries, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse investor-owned publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. We also operate several market-based businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services. We employ approximately 6,800 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to an estimated 15 million people in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada.
 Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole.
 Operating Segments
 The largest component of the Company’s business includes rate regulated subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in 16 states, collectively presented as our “Regulated Businesses”. We conduct the majority of our business through the Regulated Businesses segment. We also operate market-based businesses within four operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). These four non-reportable operating segments are collectively presented as our “Market-Based Businesses,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses. Additional information can be found in Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 19—Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Regulated Businesses 
 Our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial and other customers, including sale for resale and public authority customers. Our Regulated Businesses that provide these services operate in approximately 1,600 communities in 16 states in the United States and are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, referred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”). Certain federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We report the results of the services provided by our utilities in our Regulated Businesses segment.
 Our Regulated Businesses segment’s operating revenues were $2,871 million for 2016, $2,743 million for 2015 and $2,674 million for 2014, accounting for 86.9%, 86.8% and 88.8%, respectively, of total operating revenues for the same periods.

Water Supply and Wastewater Services
 Our Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to our customers and collect, treat, transport and recycle wastewater. Typically, we do not own the water itself, which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. We are dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from ground water sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third party water suppliers. The level of treatment we apply to the water varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment, while groundwater sources require chemical treatment only. 
 The following chart depicts the sources of water supply as of December 31, 2016: 
 
The percentages of water supply by source type for our top seven states based on our Regulated Businesses operating revenues for 2016 were as follows: 
 
 
 | Surface Water | | | Ground Water | | | Purchased Water
--------------+---------------+----+---+--------------+----+----+----------------
New Jersey | | 72 | % | | | 23 | % | | 5 | %
Pennsylvania | | 91 | % | | | 7 | % | | 2 | %
Missouri | | 80 | % | | | 19 | % | | 1 | %
Illinois | | 53 | % | | | 36 | % | | 11 | %
Indiana | | 44 | % | | | 55 | % | | 1 | %
California | — | | | | 66 | % | | 34 | % 
West Virginia | | 99 | % | | — | | | 1 | % 

 
Our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate water supply. Drought, governmental restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination, or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. We employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversity of our service areas may mitigate some of the economic effect on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce the amount of source water available, while other areas we serve may experience wetter than average weather. 
 In our long-term planning, we evaluate quality, quantity, growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity. Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that we have adequate water supply, we use long-term planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, we employ models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of our use of long-term planning to ensure that we have adequate water supply is our involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, owned by California-American Water Company, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Cal Am”), which includes the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In

addition, the Water Supply Project also includes Cal Am’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (“MRWPCA”) and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (“MPWMD”). The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of Cal Am to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). 
 Wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.
 Economic Regulation and Rate Making Process 
 Our Regulated Businesses operate under a regulatory compact whereby, in exchange for exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services in defined service territories, we have an obligation to serve customers within those territories requesting service, within reasonable limits. In return for agreeing to invest capital into our water and wastewater systems, we are given the opportunity to recover our costs of doing business and earn a reasonable rate of return on our investments.
 The operations of our Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state PUCs, with the primary responsibility of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ from state to state, but in most states PUCs approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, capital expenditures, O&M expenses, taxes, transactions and affiliate relationships, reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time. These policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital. 
 The process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the PUC on a periodic basis. The timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. 
 Our rate case management program is guided by the principles of obtaining timely recovery of capital investment costs, recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption and appropriate recovery of utility operating and maintenance costs, including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations. The program attempts to minimize the delay, or “regulatory lag” between the time our Regulated Businesses make a capital investment or incur an operating expense increase, and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. The management team at each of our utilities accounts for the time required for the regulatory process, and files rate cases with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective. 
 5


Our Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. Examples of approved regulatory practices include:
 
 
Regulatory Practices | Description | States Allowed 
--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------
Infrastructure replacement surcharges | Allows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate proceeding, to reflect recovery of investments made to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe, reliable and affordable services for our customer. These mechanisms typically involve an upfront review of overall multi-year investment plans as well as periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency. | IL, IN, MO, NJ, NY, PA, TN, WV 
Future test year | A test period used for setting rates, that begins with the date new rates are effective. This allows current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be collected on a more timely basis. | CA, HI, IL, IN, KY, NY, PA, TN, VA 
Hybrid test year | Allows an update to historical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year. | IA, MD, MO, NJ, WV 
Utility plant recovery mechanisms | Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction. In addition, some states, such as Indiana, allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects. | CA, IL, KY, NY PA, TN, VA 
Expense mechanisms | Allows changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utility’s control, to be recovered outside of a general rate proceeding or deferred until the next general rate proceeding. | CA, IL, MD, MO, NJ, NY, PA, TN, VA, WV
Revenue stability mechanisms | Separates a water utility's cost recovery from the amount of water it sells to recover its fixed costs and on-going infrastructure investment needs. Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility's revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. | CA, IL, NY 
Consolidated tariffs | Use of a unified rate structure for multiple water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state and is generally used to moderate the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater rate structures. | IA, IL, IN, KY, MD, MO, NJ, PA, WV 

 
We pursue or seek enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments, in order to provide safe, reliable and affordable services to our customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state PUCs will accept our proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes. It is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply. 
 We also support state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries. Legislation in certain states has generally enabled sales between interested parties, has allowed a reasonable market valuation of purchased property, and has enabled consolidation of water and wastewater rates.
 Customers 
 Our Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is a person, corporation, municipality or any other entity that purchases our water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. Also, a single customer may purchase our services for use by multiple individuals or businesses in the case of many homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities. 
 Residential customers make up the majority of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate. In 2016, residential customers accounted for 91.1% of our customer base, 59.0% of the billed water sales and 55.5% of the operating revenues of our Regulated Businesses. We also serve commercial customers, such as offices, retail stores and restaurants; industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturing and production operations; and public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools. We also supply water through our distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes, to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, as well as to other water utilities in the form of bulk water supplies for distribution to their own customers.
 The vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water usage, typically on a monthly basis. We employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices (touch read) or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading. Our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based on their water consumption.

The following table summarizes the number of water and wastewater customers we served by class as of December 31: 
 
 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | | 2014 
---------------+-------+-------+------------+---+-----+------
(In thousands) | Water | | Wastewater | | | Water | | Wastewater | | Water | | Wastewater
Residential | | 2,846 | | | 171 | | | 2,829 | | | 133 | | 2,814 | | 118

Total | | 3,131 | | | 181 | | | 3,112 | | | 141 | | 3,095 | | 124

 
Customer growth in our Regulated Businesses is primarily driven by the following factors:
  
• | adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water and/or wastewater utility systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | organic population growth or decline in our authorized service areas; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the sale of water to other community water systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 Generally, we add customers through acquisitions of small and medium water and/or wastewater systems in close geographic proximity to areas where we operate our Regulated Businesses, which we refer to as “tuck-ins.” The proximity of tuck-in opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using our existing management and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. Pursuing tuck-ins has been and continues to be a fundamental part of our growth strategy. We intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and, if appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where we do not currently operate our Regulated Businesses. Before entering new regulated markets, we will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to our customers, as well as a line of sight to grow our base customers after entering the new market. For more information, see Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—2016 Strategic Focus & Achievements—Growth.
 Seasonality
 Customer demand for our water service is affected by weather and is generally greater during the summer months primarily due to increased usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, we typically expect our operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year compared to any of the other quarters. However, varying summer weather conditions can impact our third quarter financial results. Summer weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues and operating income. Summer weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues and operating income.
Competition
 In our Regulated Businesses, we generally do not face direct competition in our existing markets because: (i) we operate in those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) issued by state PUCs; and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a high barrier to market entry. However, our Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets and/or making strategic acquisitions. Our largest investor-owned competitors, when pursuing acquisitions, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, are Aqua America, Inc., United Water (owned by Suez Environnement Company S.A.), American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, we also face competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp. and Corix.
 All or portions of our regulated subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods: 
  
• | eminent domain (also known as condemnation);
--+---------------------------------------------


• | the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original certificate of public convenience and necessity was granted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its certificate.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7


The acquisition consideration related to such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter.
 We actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as developments occur. We do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our Regulated Businesses, either individually or taken as a whole. 
 Market-Based Businesses 
 Through our Market-Based Businesses, we provide services to military bases; municipalities; oil and gas exploration and production companies; and to some commercial, industrial and residential customers. These customers are not subject to economic regulation by state PUCs and do not require significant capital investment. 
 Our Market-Based Businesses segment’s operating revenues were $451 million for 2016, $434 million for 2015 and $355 million for 2014, accounting for 13.7%, 13.7% and 11.8%, respectively, of total operating revenues for the same periods. Included within the Market-Based Businesses segment results is operating revenues attributed to Canadian operations of $6 million, $6 million, and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 Our Market-Based Businesses are comprised of four operating segments: 
  
• | Military Services Group, which enters into long-term contracts, generally 50 years, with the U.S. Department of Defense for the O&M of the water and wastewater systems on certain military bases;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Homeowner Services Group, which primarily provides warranty-type services to homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking water pipes or clogged or blocked sewer pipes, located inside and outside their premise, as well as interior electric line repairs and other services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Contract Operations Group, which enters into contracts primarily to operate and maintain water and wastewater facilities and other related services mainly for municipalities and the food and beverage industry; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Keystone, which provides customized water sourcing, transfer services, pipeline construction, water and equipment hauling and water storage solutions, for natural gas exploration and production companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Military Services Group
 Our Military Services Group operates on 12 military bases under 50-year contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”). The scope of the contracts includes O&M of the water and wastewater systems on the bases and a capital program. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the Company is funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the base’s mission. Construction of new assets are funded by the U.S. DoD as additional work under the contract. The capital program does not use the Company’s equity or debt borrowings; however, some working capital is used to fund work-in-process until paid by the U.S. DoD. The contract price for nine of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and every three years thereafter. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. Three of these contracts are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination, called “Economic Price Adjustment.” During the contract term, we may make limited short-term working capital investments under our contracts with the U.S. DoD. All of these contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant to termination provisions applicable to these contracts, we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs.
Homeowner Services Group
 Our Homeowner Services Group, through our various protection programs, provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against the cost of interior and external water and sewer line repairs, interior electric line repairs and other services. Our LineSaver™ program involves partnering with utilities, municipalities and other organizations to offer our protection programs to customers serviced by or affiliated with those municipalities and organizations. Terms of these partnership agreements are typically three to five years in length, with optional renewals. As of December 31, 2016, our Homeowner Services Group had approximately 1.7 million customer contracts in 43 states and the District of Columbia and 10 LineSaver™ partnership agreements with municipalities and other organizations.  
 8


Contract Operations Group
 Our Contract Operations Group enters into public/private partnerships, including: (i) O&M; (ii) Design; Build and Operate; and (iii) Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Maintain contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities, the food and beverage industry and other customers. Historically, we have made minimal long-term capital investment under these contracts; instead we perform our services for a fee. Occasionally, we provide our customers with financing for capital projects as part of a long-term O&M partnership. As of December 31, 2016, our Contract Operations Group had 43 contracts across the United States and Canada, varying in size and scope and ranging in length from one to 30 years.    
Keystone
 In July 2015, we acquired a ninety-five percent interest in Water Solutions Holdings, LLC, including its wholly owned subsidiary, Keystone Clearwater Solutions, LLC (collectively referred to as “Keystone”). Keystone is a water management solution company currently focused on exploration and production customers in the Appalachian Basin, as well as customers in the municipal water services market. Keystone primarily provides customized water sourcing, transfer, storage and transport services, along with pipeline construction services for natural gas exploration and production companies. Keystone operates under master service agreements that generally range from two to five years. When the initial term of these agreements expire, they typically renew automatically on an annual basis and generally are cancelable by either party with 30 days prior notice. As of December 31, 2016, Keystone serves 58 customers. 
Competition
 We face competition in our Market-Based Businesses from a number of service providers, including Veolia Environnement S.A., American States Water Company, Operations Management International, Inc. and Southwest Water Company, particularly in the area of O&M contracting. Securing new O&M contracts is highly competitive, as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships, service levels, competitive pricing, references and technical expertise. We also face competition in maintaining existing O&M contracts to which we are a party, as the municipal and industrial fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process. Our Homeowner Services Group faces competition primarily from HomeServe USA, Pivotal Home Solutions (owned by Southern Company Gas) and Dominion Energy Solutions. Keystone currently faces competition from water service providers that typically provide particular segments of the water management cycle, such as Rockwater Energy Solutions, Rain for Rent and Fluid Delivery Solutions, LLC.
Industry and Regulatory Matters
 Overview 
 The United States water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions. Both industries are highly fragmented. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) estimates that approximately 84% of the United States water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned. According to the EPA, there are approximately 50,000 community water systems and approximately 20,000 community wastewater systems in the United States. Over half of the community water systems are very small, serving a population of 500 or less. 
 This large number of relatively small, fragmented water systems and wastewater systems may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace, since such utilities may not have the operating expertise, financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities. Larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems. In addition, water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases, spread across broad geographic regions, may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures, such as droughts, excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas. Larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base, thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer. Since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale, companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies, lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time.

The aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States is in need of modernization and replacement. Increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of water and wastewater residuals’ discharges, which began with passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization. In 2011, the EPA estimated that the nation’s drinking water utilities needed $384.2 billion in infrastructure investments between 2011 and 2030, for thousands of miles of pipe, treatment plants, storage tanks and other key assets, to ensure the public health, security and economic well-being of our cities, towns and communities. In the Clean Watersheds Needs Survey 2012 Report to Congress, the EPA also estimated that $271.0 billion of capital investments and would be necessary between 2012 and 2032, to meet the nation’s wastewater and stormwater treatment and collection needs. Additionally, in 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”) published its Report Card for America’s Infrastructure, in which it gave the water and wastewater infrastructure a grade of “D” because much of the infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life. The ASCE report concluded that there will be an investment gap between 2013 and 2020 of $84 billion for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. 
 The following chart depicts estimated aggregate capital expenditure needs from 2011 through 2030 for United States drinking water systems:

 Environmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation 
 Our water and wastewater operations, including the services provided by both our Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses, are subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect, treat, discharge, recycle and dispose of wastewater. These regulations include the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and other U.S. federal, state, local and Canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute. We also are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and Canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. State PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. 
 Environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently. The overall trend has been that they have become increasingly stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, our capital and operating costs could increase. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation to which our operations are subject. In the past, our Regulated Businesses have generally been able to recover costs associated with compliance related to environmental, health and safety standards; however, this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery. We estimate that we will make capital expenditures of $83 million during 2017 and $78 million during 2018 for environmental control facilities, which we define for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land.

We maintain an environmental program including responsible business practices, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, effective use of natural resources, and stewardship of biodiversity. We believe that our operations are materially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations. Water samples from across our water systems are analyzed on a regular basis for compliance with regulatory requirements. Across our Company, we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous on-line instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. For 2016, we achieved a score of greater than 99% for drinking water compliance and according to the EPA’s statistics, American Water’s performance has been far better than the industry average over the last several years. In fact, in 2016, American Water systems were 21 times better than the industry average for compliance with drinking water requirements. 
 We participate in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 69 of our 81 surface water plants receiving the program’s “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that: (1) have completed a comprehensive self-assessment report, (2) created an action plan for continuous improvement and (3) produced high quality drinking water, we account for approximately one-third of the plants receiving such awards nationwide. In addition, 66 American Water surface water plants have received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, while 60 plants have been awarded the “Ten-Year Phase III” award. Additionally, 39 surface water plants received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award, which recognizes plants that have met the Director award status for 15 years. Further, nine surface water plants have been awarded the “Presidents” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards.
 Safe Drinking Water Act 
 
The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants, the treatment systems which may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements. Federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly stringent, including increased water testing requirements, to reflect public health concerns. To date, the EPA has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water.
 The EPA Administrator has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants to help formulate the basis for future regulations. Many of our systems recently completed the process for monitoring 28 unregulated contaminants under the third round of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, and our laboratory and systems are preparing for the fourth round of testing expected to begin in 2018. There are thousands of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which are lacking a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects information and/or treatment technology. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complicated, but American Water actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groups by sharing its research and water quality operational knowledge. 
 To effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms, the EPA has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and by-products of the disinfection process. In January 2006, the EPA promulgated the Long-term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule. In October 2006, the EPA finalized the Ground Water Rule, applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources. In July 2014, the State of California implemented a primary drinking water standard of 10 micrograms per liter for hexavalent chromium. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceedance of bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. We are in compliance with these standards. The EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalent chromium, fluoride, nitrosamines, perchlorate, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. We do not anticipate that any such regulations, if enacted, will require implementation in 2017. 
 The EPA revised the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing Lead and Copper Rule in 2007 and Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act in January 2011 regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings or fixtures, solder and flux. However, the events in Flint, Michigan have highlighted attention on the occurrence of lead – primarily in building plumbing – and it is anticipated that the EPA will propose updated regulations in 2017. American Water’s inventory of lead service lines is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. It is currently estimated that approximately 5% of our service lines contain lead. Our goal is to replace our lead service lines over approximately 10 years, at an estimated cost of $600 million to $1.2 billion. In cases where we are replacing an American Water owned lead service line, our standard approach will be to replace the company-owned portion and work with the customer to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line, all the way to the customer’s home. Replacing the full service line is considered a best practice as advised by the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, a collaborative of leading water industry organizations. We do not plan on replacing customer-owned lead service lines at locations where our portion of the service line does not contain lead or is not part of a main replacement project.

Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, we do not expect current requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by the state PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, we expect to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements. 
 Clean Water Act 
 The Federal Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems, our operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant penalties and compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdens on our operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at our facilities, some of which result in fines. We do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 
Other Environmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Matters 
 Our operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals which generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. We also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our off-site disposal of wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as the owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs. Our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and are subject to inspections thereunder. For further information, see Item 1—Business—Research and Development.
 Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters. Further description of these proceedings can be found in Item 3—Legal Proceedings.
 Research and Development 
 We have a research and development program, which seeks to improve water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our business. Our research and development personnel are located in New Jersey and Illinois. In addition, our quality control and testing laboratory in Belleville, Illinois supports our research and development activities through testing and analysis. 
 We continue to collaborate with the EPA to achieve effective environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation. This relationship includes sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research. Our engagement with the EPA provides us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements. 
 Approximately one-quarter of our research budget is funded by competitively awarded outside research grants. Such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers. In 2016, we spent $4 million, including $1 million funded by research grants. Spending, net of research grant funding, amounted to $3 million in 2015 and 2014. 
 We believe that continued research and development activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining our leadership position in the industry, which provides us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers.
