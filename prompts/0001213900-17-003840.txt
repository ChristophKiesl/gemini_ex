Corporate Overview and History of Evans Brewing Company, Inc. (Formerly ALPINE 3, Inc.).
 
Evans Brewing Company, Inc. (formerly ALPINE 3 Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18, 2013. Alpine 3 Inc. was set up to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. ALPINE 3 did not undertake any effort to cause a market to develop in its securities, either debt or equity, before it successfully concluded a business combination. On April 4, 2014, The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the “Trust”) purchased 10,000,000 shares of common stock which was all of the outstanding shares of Alpine 3, Inc., and subsequently changed the name to Evans Brewing Company Inc. (“EBC”) on May 29, 2014. On October 9, 2014 the Trust agreed to the cancellation of 9,600,000 of the shares of common stock that it had acquired and retained 400,000 shares of common stock.

On October 15, 2014, Bayhawk and EBC entered into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”), subject to receiving approval of the independent Bayhawk shareholders who voted on the transaction. On September 17, 2015, the independent Bayhawk shareholders approved the agreement by a vote of 251,212 shares for and 1,600 shares against. As such, Bayhawk sold to EBC, and EBC purchased from Bayhawk, assets of Bayhawk, including but not limited to: (A) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales label (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below); and (B) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below) (collectively, the “Transferred Assets”). Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in Evans Brewing Co. (CA) (“Evans Brewing California”) which has the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse, WI (where the non-craft brands will be brewed, with the balance of the craft brands being brewed in Irvine, California). Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock, on a one-for-one basis (the “Exchange Offer”). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares. There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.
 
Overview
 
The brewery continued to operate under the Bayhawk Ales, Inc. name as it transitioned the licensing and branding over to Evans Brewing Company, Inc. That process has been completed and all future activities will be under the Evans Brewing Company banner. Bayhawk Ales Inc. will be dissolved and all of its history will become that of Evans Brewing Company, Inc.
 
Evans Brewing Company is a craft brewery based on Orange County, California that produces and sells premium craft beers, including a variety of ales and lagers. EBC’s beers are currently produced in its 17-barrel brewery in Irvine, California, the oldest continuously operating brewing facility in Orange County and one of the oldest in all of Southern California. This facility has been producing craft beers since January 1995. The brewery is located in a leased building in the McCormick & Schmick’s Seafood Restaurant.
 
EBC products include four beers that are packaged year-round (Pollen Nation Honey Blonde Ale, The KrHOPen India Pale Ale, Oaklore Brown Ale, and ChocōLatté Chocolate Porter), various draft-only offerings (which include The Joaquin Dead Mexican Red Ale, OC Pale Ale, Son of a Beach Blonde Ale), and seasonal beers (which include Approachable Bastard Session IPA, Stout at the Devil Russian Imperial Stout, crHOP Dust Hefeweizen, and Oktoberfest). EBC’s labels for its year round packaging were approved in 2016 and the beers are currently being sold with these labels. EBC has the exclusive rights to make, manufacture, produce, market, sell, and distribute original beers, lagers, and ales known as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents. EBC also owns the assets of Pig’s Eye Brewing Company, LLC, (the “EBC Malt Assets”) including the intellectual property and trademarks relating to original beers, lagers, and ales, including Milwaukee Select and Pig’s Eye (the “EBC Malt Brands”). EBC’s products are distributed to restaurants and other retail outlets in nine states. EBC also produces and packages kegged beer on a private label basis for restaurants and other customers, with the names for such products determined collaboratively with such customer and each product co-branded with the phrase “by Evans Brewing Company”.
 
In addition to manufacturing and selling the products above, EBC also produces and packages beers for other craft breweries in Southern California on a contract-basis. Further, in addition to beer production and sales generally, EBC also produces and offers for sale certain “Evans Brewing Company” branded merchandise including apparel, glassware and other beer accessories.
 
On September 29, 2016, Evans Brewing Company, Inc., closed the acquisition of a restaurant business located in the downtown SOCO District of Fullerton, California, through the acquisition of all the outstanding stock of EBC Public House, Inc., which the Company now operates as its first branded restaurant and taproom under the trade name “The Public House by Evans Brewing Company”. The Public House features the Company’s beers – as well as beers from other selected local Orange County, California breweries, -- food and, potentially, occasional entertainment.
 
In connection with such closing, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of EBC Public House from Mr. Rapport and issued 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Rapport. The asset purchase and share exchange have been treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.

Background
 
EBC and Bayhawk filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Registration Statement”), which went effective on August 10, 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17, 2015, the voting period closed, and EBC announced that approximately 99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction.
 
In connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction, EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the “Bill of Sale”) which outlined the specific assets purchased, as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities agreement (the “Assumption Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC.
 
In connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement, EBC acquired the assets (other than the ownership of Evans Brewing California), the liabilities, and the operations of Bayhawk. As such, on December 10, 2015, in connection with this acquisition, EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2, in that it had assets consisting of more than cash and cash equivalents, and has a business plan and operations.
 
Bayhawk Ales
 
Bayhawk Ales, Inc. (formerly Orange County Brewing Company) (“Bayhawk”) was formed in February 1994 for the purpose of developing and operating one or more breweries in California for the production of high quality, hand-crafted ales for sale in bottle and draft. The Company built a 17-barrel showcase brewery (the "Southern California Brewery") in a leased building in the McCormick & Schmick’s Seafood Restaurant in Irvine, California. The Southern California Brewery, located in the central business district of Irvine near John Wayne International Airport, began brewing beer in January 1995. Irvine is south of Los Angeles and is adjacent to Newport Beach. It is a suburban city of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area and the location of numerous businesses. At the time of the construction of the Southern California Brewery, the Los Angeles metropolitan area was the largest single market for beer in the United States. The products produced by Bayhawk are 90% private labeled. The business has only recently in the last few years become profitable.

The restaurant was acquired from Michael J Rapport and it features the Company’s beers, as well as beers from other selected local Orange County, California breweries, food and occasional entertainment. The Restaurant is the first in a chain of restaurants to be added by the Company.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
Closing of Asset Purchase Transaction
 
On December 10, 2015, EBC completed the previously announced acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Bayhawk, pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014 (subsequently amended and restated on August 6, 2015 (as amended, the “Agreement”)).
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, Bayhawk had agreed to sell, and EBC had agreed to purchase, substantially all of Bayhawk’s assets, as well as its liabilities (collectively, the “Asset Purchase Transaction”). The assets and liabilities of Bayhawk include personal property, intellectual property, inventory, selected distribution contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales labels; and (B) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (collectively, the “Transferred Assets”), and the assumption by EBC, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, of all of the liabilities of Bayhawk (the “Assumed Liabilities”). (The “Evans Brands” include the former assets of Pig’s Eye Brewing Company, including its original beers, lagers and ales (“Pig’s Eye Brands”), as well as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents.) Pursuant to the Agreement, EBC has the right to purchase from Bayhawk 100% ownership in Evans Brewing California.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, EBC and Bayhawk agreed to seek approval of the shareholders of Bayhawk relating to the Asset Purchase Transaction. Because the principal majority stockholders of Bayhawk are also significant stockholders of EBC, Bayhawk and EBC agreed to proceed with the Asset Purchase Transaction if it was approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Independent Shares (i.e. shares not held by Bayhawk’s majority shareholder, The Michael J. Rapport Trust, or by Evan Rapport, who is an officer of EBC and the son of Michael Rapport) that actually vote on the Asset Purchase Transaction proposal.
 
EBC and Bayhawk filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Registration Statement”), which went effective on August 10, 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17, 2015, the voting period closed, and EBC announced that approximately 99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction.
 
In connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction, EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the “Bill of Sale”) which outlined the specific assets purchased, as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities agreement (the “Assumption Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC.

Equipment Lease to Bayhawk
 
Following the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction, EBC entered into an equipment lease (the “Equipment Lease”) with Bayhawk pursuant to which EBC leased the brewing equipment to Bayhawk. The Equipment Lease was effective as of December 1, 2015, and continues month to month. Bayhawk agreed to pay a minimum of $15,000 per month or net profits from operations, whichever is greater. The title to the leased equipment will remain with EBC, and EBC has the right to inspect the equipment and its usage.
 
The foregoing summaries of the terms and conditions of the Bill of Sale, the Assumption Agreement, and the Equipment Lease (collectively, the “Ancillary Agreements”) do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the specific Ancillary Agreement, each of which was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015.
 
Effective September, 2016 the Bayhawk name was dissolved and all operations are now under the name of Evans Brewing Company, Inc and the lease is no longer needed.
 
Change in Shell Company Status
 
In connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement, EBC acquired the assets (other than the ownership of Evans Brewing California), the liabilities, and the operations of Bayhawk. As such, on December 10, 2015, in connection with this acquisition, EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2, in that it has assets consisting of more than cash and cash equivalents, and has a business plan and operations.
Share Exchange
 
As discussed in more detail above and below in this Annual Report, as partial consideration for the purchase of the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, EBC agreed to offer to exchange shares of EBC common stock for all shares of Bayhawk common stock that were tendered in connection with such offer, the transaction being referred to as the “Share Exchange.” The ratio of the share exchange is one (1) share of EBC common stock for each one (1) share of Bayhawk common stock.
 
Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock, on a one-for-one basis (the “Exchange Offer”). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares. There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.
 
No Change of Control
 
In connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction, and the share exchange for the restaurant, there was no change in control of EBC. The officers and directors of EBC did not change, and the majority ownership of EBC did not change.
 
As noted, prior to the closing of the Share Exchange, there was no way to determine how many shares of Bayhawk common stock will be exchanged for shares of EBC common stock. Nevertheless, Michael J. Rapport owns, through The Michael J. Rapport Trust, a majority of the outstanding common stock of both EBC and Bayhawk. As such, following the closing of the Share Exchange, Mr. Rapport continued to own a majority of the common stock of EBC, and as such, there was no change in control of EBC.

On September 29, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of EBC Public House from Mr. Rapport and issued 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Rapport. The close of the restaurant was based on the agreement entered into on December 10, 2015, wherein, EBC entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Public House SPA”) with Michael J. Rapport, as the sole shareholder of EBC Public House, Inc., a California corporation (“Public House”), for the purchase by EBC of 100% of the outstanding shares of Public House from Mr. Rapport, with the transaction closing on September 29, 2016.
