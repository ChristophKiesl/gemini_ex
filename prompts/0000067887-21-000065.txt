Item 1. | Business.

Description of the Business. Moog is a worldwide designer, manufacturer and systems integrator of high performance precision motion and fluid controls and controls systems for a broad range of applications in aerospace and defense and industrial markets. We have three operating segments: Aircraft Controls, Space and Defense Controls and Industrial Systems.
Additional information describing the business and comparative segment revenues, operating profits and related financial information for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are provided in Note 21, Segments, of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Distribution. Our sales and marketing organization consists of individuals possessing highly specialized technical expertise. This expertise is required in order to effectively evaluate a customer’s precision control requirements and to facilitate communication between the customer and our engineering staff. Our sales staff is the primary contact with customers. Manufacturers’ representatives are used to cover certain domestic aerospace markets. Distributors are used selectively to cover certain industrial and medical markets.
Industry and Competitive Conditions. We experience considerable competition in our aerospace and defense and industrial markets. We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, reliability, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, timeliness of delivery, effectiveness of the distribution organization and quality of support after the sale. We believe we compete effectively on all of these bases. Competitors in our three operating segments include:
•Aircraft Controls: Curtiss-Wright, Liebherr, Nabtesco, Parker-Hannifin, Raytheon Technologies and Woodward.
•Space and Defense Controls: Aerojet Rocketdyne, Airbus, Amphenol, Cobham, Curtiss-Wright, Eaton, Elbit, General Dynamics, Glenair, Honeywell, IHI-Aerospace, Kongsberg, LORD, RUAG, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Raytheon Technologies, Schleifring, SEAKR, and Woodward.
•Industrial Systems: Allied Motion, Baumüller, Atos S.p.A, Bosch Rexroth, Cardinal Health, Eaton, ebm-papst, MTS Systems, Nidec, Parker-Hannifin, Schleifring, Shinano Kenshi, Smiths Medical, Wittenstein Group and Woodward.
Government Contracts. All United States ("U.S.") Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government. In 2021, sales under U.S. Government contracts represented 44% of total sales and were primarily within our Aircraft Controls and Space and Defense Controls segments.
Backlog. Our twelve-month backlog represents confirmed orders we believe will be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months. As noted in Item 6, Selected Financial Data of this report, as of October 2, 2021, our twelve-month backlog was $2.1 billion, an increase of 24% compared to October 3, 2020. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for a discussion on the various business drivers and conditions contributing to the twelve-month backlog change.
Raw Materials. Materials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous suppliers. We believe the loss of any one supplier, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term.
Working Capital. See the discussion on operating cycle in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Seasonality. Our business is generally not seasonal; however, certain products and systems, such as those in the energy market of our Industrial Systems segment, do experience seasonal variations in sales levels.
Patents. We maintain a patent portfolio of issued or pending patents and patent applications worldwide that generally includes the U.S., Europe, China, Japan and India. The portfolio includes patents that relate to electrohydraulic, electromechanical, electronics, hydraulics, components and methods of operation and manufacture as related to motion control and actuation systems. The portfolio also includes patents related to wind turbines, robotics, surveillance/security, vibration control and medical devices. We do not consider any one or more of these patents or patent applications to be material in relation to our business as a whole. The patent portfolio related to certain medical devices is significant to our position in this market as several of these products work exclusively together, and provide us future revenue opportunities.
Research Activities. Research and development activity has been, and continues to be, significant for us. Research and development expense was at least $110 million in each of the last three years and represented approximately 4% of sales in 2021.
Human Capital Resources. Moog possesses a unique culture that fuels our business success. Our nearly 14,000 employees across over 25 countries work closely together, driven by a shared sense of purpose and a desire to do the right thing. We value our ground-breaking, challenging work and what we stand for. We value the skill and commitment of our talented workforce above all else. Whether it’s enabling a Mars Rover to land safely or helping to support breakthrough advances in healthcare, together, we solve our customers’ most difficult challenges. 
Although we are a successful, global business, our employees feel like they are amongst friends and are comfortable being themselves. We empower them to find innovative ways of accomplishing things, and the scale of our business means that careers can develop in exciting and unexpected directions. For prospective employees looking for inspiring and meaningful work in a warm, respectful, family-like environment, Moog will feel like home.
In order to ensure we live our values and our culture stays unique and strong, our Board of Directors and executive team put significant focus on our human capital resources. These are some of the key aspects of Moog’s human capital strategy:
Managing Through the Global Pandemic
As we managed through the second year of the global pandemic, we continued to run our business in a manner that was focused on maintaining the health and safety of our employees while meeting our customers’ requirements as an essential business. We were able to effectively support a large number of employees working from home, developed policies and educational materials with employee safety in mind, and re-configured our production environments to maintain proper social distancing. We provided time-off and salary continuation benefits to employees affected by COVID-19 in a manner consistent with our values. 
As the pandemic continued through 2021, we:
•Added additional benefits to help our employees cope with personal challenges such as childcare, eldercare, health care and schooling.
•Sponsored on-site immunization clinics.
•Provided “mental health” days.
•Created training programs and support groups to help people balance changing work and personal requirements brought on by the pandemic.
•Created and implemented protocols for employees returning to the workplace.
We are very proud of how Moog and our people adapted during the pandemic. We are certainly stronger from the multitude of business and personnel challenges we successfully worked through. 
Moog deeply mourns the employees we lost to COVID-19. 
Employee Recruitment
Moog actively seeks to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources and industries in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with trade schools, world-class universities, professional associations, and industry groups to proactively attract talent. 
In 2021, we hired 1,348 new regular employees throughout the world. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Moog aspires to be diverse, equitable, and inclusive, where employees are empowered to bring their whole, authentic selves to work every day. We believe being diverse, equitable and inclusive is better for all of our employees, customers and shareholders. 
During 2021, we rolled out a new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy. In support of this strategy, we:
•Conducted a variety of learning programs to help our employees understand the value of inclusivity, the very different experiences people have, and the role we all must play in creating an inclusive and welcoming environment at Moog.
•Honored employees from different backgrounds and helped increase understanding through a variety of monthly celebrations, including, but not limited, to Black History Month, International Women’s Day, and Pride Month. 
•Piloted Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"). Our ERGs are voluntary, employee-led, corporate-supported groups that are organized primarily around a defined characteristic, special interest, or life experience. This year we supported the formation of ERGs to better enable women and gender equality and to support our black employees. 
At Moog, we are pleased that 33% of the executive team and 29% of our independent directors are female. Having said that, we are continuously striving to ensure the diversity of our organization more fully represents the diversity of the communities in which we operate. 
Compensation and Benefits
Moog works to maintain compensation, benefits and rewards programs that enable us to attract, retain, motivate, and reward employees for their contributions to company performance. Our compensation and rewards programs are linked closely to our values of We Are All In This Together, We Try Harder, Competence Is King and Performance And Commitment Should Be Rewarded.
Moog is committed to providing comprehensive benefit options that reflect the differing priorities and needs of our sites globally, governed by an intent to offer plans that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives.
In addition to traditional employee benefits, Moog has a number of innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employee base, including onsite wellness clinics at a number of locations, online tools that assist employees with their physical and mental health, special events with outside vendors and participants focusing on employee well-being and much more.
Health and Safety
Maintaining a safe and healthy work environment is a key priority and a responsibility for all of our employees. At Moog, we embrace a continuous improvement approach with regard to our global Environment, Health & Safety ("EHS") culture. All Moog businesses strive to operate in a responsible manner that demonstrates our commitment to the health and safety of our employees, customers, suppliers, communities and the environment. Our commitment will not be compromised. We expect our employees, visitors and service providers to follow our EHS standards and practices. We regularly conduct training for all of our employees and work hard to learn lessons from every incident. Additionally, we measure and review our EHS results continuously in each location. 
Employee Engagement and Retention 
Moog is deeply committed to continuously evolving into an even better place to work. We're built on a strong foundation of mutual trust and the premise that we must engage with employees at different levels to empower our people, enable progress and align efforts.
Moog employs a variety of mechanisms to collect and respond to feedback from our employees. We conduct a regular employee engagement survey. We also leverage focus groups and listening sessions to solicit feedback. 
In response to employee feedback and in acknowledgment of the changing landscape brought about by the global pandemic, Moog has been piloting a variety of flexible working arrangements, including remote work and hybrid working schedules. We are implementing these changes in a way that allows our employees to collaborate and innovate in the Moog Way that has made us so successful to date. 
We see our positive employee engagement coming through in high levels of employee retention. For the last four years, the average of voluntary attrition has been just below 5% of our workforce. That is a competitive attrition figure and a testament to Moog being a great place to work. 
Leadership Development and Training
At Moog, we believe that the best leaders are the ones who come from within. These leaders learn with us, grow with us, and reach their potential through challenging job experiences we provide and deliberate learning experiences. 
Moog has carefully designed two leadership development programs to improve the effectiveness of our managers. Our Moog Leadership Program is a two-year program designed to expand, develop, support, and sustain high potential leadership throughout the Company. This program accelerates the growth and development of our high potential employees and prepares them for future senior-level roles within the organization. Our Emerging Leadership Program is a nine-month global, cross-group leadership development program. The goal of this program is to accelerate the development of a pool of global, cross-group top talent in order to help meet the demand for important leadership roles throughout our Company. Finally, our leading and coaching people program, which is open to people managers at Moog, is a two-day course and provides the foundational framework for engaging, empowering, and coaching employees for optimal performance.
In addition to our leadership development programs, Moog has many other valuable training resources available for employees in order to ensure our people have everything they need to succeed both personally and professionally. Moog facilitates these training opportunities and programs through state-of-the-art learning management systems. Our employees are encouraged to take responsibility for their own development and create learning plans that fit their needs and development goals best.
Succession Planning
Each year Moog conducts an extensive talent review across our global enterprise that includes, among other important topics, a review of succession plans for many of our roles. To ensure the long-term continuity of our business, we actively manage the development of talent to fill the roles that are most critical to the on-going success of our Company. 
Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility
Our values, rooted in trust, integrity, and collaboration, lay the foundation for Moog's commitment to corporate social and environmental responsibility. As a company, we believe that to be truly successful, we must do our part to improve the world for current and future generations. At Moog, we are committed to: 
•Protecting our planet by minimizing our environmental impact.
•Striving to contribute our time, talent, and resources to strengthen the communities where we do business.
•Engaging in ethical practices. 
We're all in this together - when our local and global communities succeed, we succeed. Moog and its employees live this mantra with countless initiatives focused on supporting our communities both financially and with employee time. Some recent examples of Moog’s “responsibility in action” include:
•Our Moog team in India sponsored 300 cataract surgeries through Nayonika Eye Care Charitable Trust.
•Our Wolverhampton, United Kingdom ("UK") site has transitioned 90% of its electric lighting to LED bulbs; in doing so, the site will save over 13,000 kWh each year.
•Our U.S. and UK organizations piloted a “direct giving program” that allows our employees to contribute funds and volunteer time to local charities that are meaningful to them. 
•A group of our employees in Torrance, California donated their time to crochet hats and other items for nonprofits like the American Heart Association's "Little Hats, Big Hearts" program.
Business Ethics
Moog is fully dedicated to conducting ourselves by the letter and in the spirit of the many laws and standards that apply to our business. Ethics are deeply embedded in our values and business processes. We regularly re-enforce our commitment to ethics and integrity in employee communications, in our everyday actions and in processes and controls. As a part of our on-going efforts to ensure our employees conduct business with the highest levels of ethics and integrity, Moog has compliance training programs in multiple languages. We also maintain two ethics related hotlines, through which individuals can anonymously raise concerns they have about business behavior they do not feel comfortable discussing personally with business operations managers or human resources personnel. The Company's general confidential ethics hotline is administered by internal company counsel designated as Moog's ethics advocate. In addition, we maintain a separate hotline for cases wherein an employee believes that the Company's financial statements are materially misstated as a result of intentional acts or material weaknesses in the systems of internal control. This hotline is administered by the Company's corporate Secretary.
Customers. Our principal customers are Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"), and end users for whom we provide aftermarket support. Aerospace and defense OEM customers collectively represented 58% of 2021 sales. The majority of these sales are to a small number of large companies. Due to the long-term nature of many of the programs, many of our relationships with aerospace and defense OEM customers are based on long-term agreements. Our industrial OEM sales, which represented 31% of 2021 sales, are to a wide range of global customers and are normally based on lead times of 90 days or less. We also provide aftermarket support, consisting of spare and replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, for all of our products. Our major aftermarket customers are the U.S. Government and commercial airlines. In 2021, aftermarket sales accounted for 11% of total sales.
