ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Development of Business
O-I Glass, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), through its subsidiaries, is the successor to a business established in 1903. The Company is one of the leading manufacturers of glass containers in the world with 72 glass manufacturing plants in 20 countries. It competes in the glass container segment of the rigid packaging market and is the leading glass container manufacturer in most of the countries where it has manufacturing facilities.
The term “Company,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refers to Owens-Illinois, Inc. and its affiliates (“O-I”) prior to the Corporate Modernization (as defined below) and to O-I Glass, Inc. and its affiliates (“O-I Glass”) after the Corporate Modernization.
Corporate Modernization and Paddock’s Chapter 11 Filing
On December 26 and 27, 2019, the Company implemented the Corporate Modernization pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of December 26, 2019, among O-I, O-I Glass and Paddock Enterprises, LLC (“Paddock”).
The Corporate Modernization was conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which permits the creation of a holding company through a merger with a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the constituent corporation without stockholder approval. The Corporate Modernization involved a series of transactions (together with certain related transactions, the “Corporate Modernization”) pursuant to which (1) O-I formed a new holding company, O-I Glass, as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of O-I and a sister company to Owens-Illinois Group, Inc. (“O-I Group”), (2) O-I Glass formed a new Delaware limited liability company, Paddock, as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of O-I Glass, (3) O-I merged with and into Paddock, with Paddock continuing as the surviving entity and as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of O-I Glass (the “Merger”) and (4) Paddock distributed 100% of the capital stock of O-I Group to O-I Glass, as a result of which O-I Group is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of O-I Glass and sister company to Paddock.
Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, each share of O-I stock held immediately prior to the Merger automatically converted into a right to receive an equivalent corresponding share of O-I Glass stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions as the corresponding share of O-I stock being converted. Immediately after the Corporate Modernization, O-I Glass had, on a consolidated basis, the same assets, businesses and operations as O-I had immediately prior to the Corporate Modernization. After the Corporate Modernization, O-I’s share owners became share owners of O-I Glass. The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and as a result, the stockholders of O-I do not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the conversion of their O-I shares. 
On January 6, 2020, Paddock voluntarily filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to equitably and finally resolve all of its current and future asbestos-related claims. O-I Glass and O-I Group were not included in the Chapter 11 filing. Paddock’s ultimate goal in its Chapter 11 case is to confirm a plan of reorganization under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code and utilize this specialized provision to establish a trust that will address all current and future asbestos-related claims. Paddock now operates in the ordinary course under court protection from Asbestos Claims (as defined herein) by operation of the automatic stay in Paddock’s Chapter 11 filing, which stays ongoing litigation and submission of claims to Paddock, defers payment of outstanding obligations on account of settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and will provide a centralized forum to resolve presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos.

​
Reportable Segments
Historically, the Company had three reportable segments based on its geographic locations: Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. These three segments are aligned with the Company’s internal approach to managing, reporting, and evaluating performance of its global glass operations. 
On July 31, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its Australia and New Zealand (“ANZ”) businesses, which comprised the majority of its businesses in the Asia Pacific region (approximately 85% of net sales in that region for the full year 2019), to Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd. (“Visy”).  After the sale of the ANZ businesses, the remaining businesses in the Asia Pacific region do not meet the criteria of an individually reportable segment. Thus, after 2020, the Company will no longer report results for the Asia Pacific reportable segment. For the historical periods presented in this report, the results for the Asia Pacific reportable segment reflect only the results of the ANZ businesses. The sales and operating results of the other businesses that 

2



historically comprised the Asia Pacific segment, and that have been retained by the Company, have been reclassified to Other sales and Retained corporate costs and other, respectively.
Products and Services
The Company produces glass containers for alcoholic beverages, including beer, flavored malt beverages, spirits and wine. The Company also produces glass packaging for a variety of food items, soft drinks, teas, juices and pharmaceuticals. The Company manufactures glass containers in a wide range of sizes, shapes and colors and is active in new product development and glass container innovation.
Customers
In most of the countries where the Company competes, it has the leading position in the glass container segment of the rigid packaging market based on sales revenue. The Company’s largest customers consist mainly of the leading global food and beverage manufacturers, including (in alphabetical order) Anheuser-Busch InBev, Brown-Forman, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Constellation, Diageo, Heineken, Molson Coors, Nestle, and PepsiCo. 
The Company sells most of its glass container products directly to customers under annual or multi-year supply agreements. Multi-year contracts typically provide for price adjustments based on cost changes. The Company also sells some of its products through distributors. Many customers provide the Company with regular estimates of their product needs, which enables the Company to schedule glass container production to maintain reasonable levels of inventory. Glass container manufacturing facilities are generally located in close proximity to customers.
Sales and Markets
The Company’s principal markets for glass container products are in the Americas and Europe with select operations remaining in the Asia Pacific region after the sale of its ANZ businesses.
Americas. The Company has 35 glass container manufacturing plants in the Americas region located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, the U.S. and interests in three joint ventures that manufacture glass containers. Also, the Company has a distribution facility in the U.S. used to import glass containers from its business in Mexico. The Company has the leading share of the glass container segment of the U.S. rigid packaging market, based on sales revenue by domestic producers. In South America and Mexico, the Company maintains a diversified portfolio serving several markets, including alcoholic beverages (beer, wine and spirits), non-alcoholic beverages and food, as well as a large infrastructure for returnable/refillable glass containers. 
The principal glass container competitors in the U.S. are the Ardagh Group and Anchor Glass Container. Imports from China, Mexico, Taiwan and other countries also compete in U.S. glass container segments. Additionally, there are several major consumer packaged goods companies that self-manufacture glass containers. The Company competes directly with Verallia in Brazil and Argentina, and does not believe that it competes with any other large, multinational glass container manufacturers in the rest of the region. 
Europe. The Company is one of the leaders in the glass container segment of the rigid packaging market in the European countries in which it operates, with 34 glass container manufacturing plants located in the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. These plants primarily produce glass containers for the alcoholic beverages (beer, wine and spirits), non-alcoholic beverages and food markets in these countries. The Company also has interests in two joint ventures that manufacture glass containers in Italy. Throughout Europe, the Company competes directly with a variety of glass container manufacturers including Verallia, Ardagh Group, Vetropack, Vidrala and BA Vidro.
Asia Pacific. After 2020, the Company will no longer report results for the Asia Pacific reportable segment due to the sale of most of this segment. On July 31, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its ANZ businesses, which comprised the majority of its businesses in the Asia Pacific region (approximately 85% of net sales in that region for the full year 2019), to Visy.  After the sale of the ANZ businesses, the remaining 

3



businesses in the Asia Pacific region, which consist of three plants and a joint venture, do not meet the criteria of an individually reportable segment.
In addition to competing with other large and well-established manufacturers in the glass container segment, the Company competes in all regions with manufacturers of other forms of rigid packaging, principally aluminum cans and plastic containers. Competition is based on quality, price, service, innovation and the marketing attributes of the container. The principal competitors producing metal containers include Ardagh Group, Ball Corporation, Crown Holdings, Inc., and Silgan Holdings Inc. The principal competitors producing plastic containers include Amcor, Consolidated Container Holdings, LLC, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, Plastipak Packaging, Inc. and Silgan Holdings Inc. The Company also competes with manufacturers of non-rigid packaging alternatives, including flexible pouches, aseptic cartons and bag-in-box containers.
The Company seeks to provide products and services to customers ranging from large multinationals to small local breweries and wineries in a way that creates a competitive advantage for the Company. The Company believes that it is often the glass container partner of choice because of its innovation and branding capabilities, its global footprint and its expertise in manufacturing know-how and process technology.
Seasonality 
Sales of many glass container products such as beer, beverages and food are seasonal. Shipments in North America and Europe are typically greater in the second and third quarters of the year, while shipments in Latin America are typically greater in the third and fourth quarters of the year. 
​
Manufacturing
The Company has 72 glass manufacturing plants. It constantly seeks to improve the productivity of these operations through the systematic upgrading of production capabilities, sharing of best practices among plants and effective training of employees.
The Company also provides engineering support for its glass manufacturing operations through facilities located in the U.S., Poland and Peru.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used in the Company’s glass container operations are sand, soda ash, limestone and recycled glass. Each of these materials, as well as the other raw materials used to manufacture glass containers, has historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources.
Energy
The Company’s glass container operations require a continuous supply of significant amounts of energy, principally natural gas, fuel oil and electrical power. Adequate supplies of energy are generally available at all of the Company’s manufacturing locations. Energy costs typically account for 10% to 20% of the Company’s total manufacturing costs, depending on the cost of energy, the type of energy available, the factory location and the particular energy requirements. The percentage of total cost related to energy can vary significantly because of volatility in market prices, particularly for natural gas and fuel oil in volatile markets such as North America and Europe.
In the Americas’ businesses in the U.S. and Canada, more than 90% of the sales volume is represented by customer contracts that contain provisions that pass the commodity price of natural gas to the customer, effectively reducing the region’s exposure to changing natural gas market prices. In the Americas’ business in South America and Mexico, there is a combination of fixed price contracts, as well as energy pricing linked to variable commodities pricing. Also, in these countries, customer contracts generally allow for annual price adjustments for inflation, variability in energy costs, and foreign currency variation.
In Europe, the Company enters into long-term contracts for a significant amount of its energy requirements. These contracts have terms that range from one to five years.

Research, Development and Engineering
Research, development and engineering constitute important parts of the Company’s technical activities. The Company primarily focuses on advancements in the areas of product innovation, manufacturing process control, melting technology, automatic inspection, light-weighting and further automation of manufacturing activities. The Company has increased its focus on advancing melting technology with investments in modular glass melting furnaces. The Company’s investments in this new technology, known as the MAGMA program, seek to reduce the amount of capital required to install, rebuild and operate its furnaces. This new melting technology is also focused on the ability of these assets to be more easily turned on and off or adjusted based on seasonality and customer demands. The Company’s research and development activities are conducted principally at its corporate facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio.
The Company holds a large number of patents related to a wide variety of products and processes and has a substantial number of patent applications pending. While the aggregate of the Company’s patents are of material importance to its businesses, the Company does not consider that any patent or group of patents relating to a particular product or process is of material importance when judged from the standpoint of any individual segment or its businesses as a whole.
Sustainability, the Environment and Workplace Safety
The Company is committed to sustainability, including reducing the impact its products and operations have on the environment. As part of this commitment, the Company has set sustainability targets, including some for increasing the use of recycled glass in its manufacturing process and reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2”) emissions, and aligned its sustainability ambitions with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Some specific actions taken by the Company include expanding sustainability corporate governance at the board level, appointing a Chief Sustainability Officer who reports to the CEO, establishing a global sustainability network, working with governments and other organizations to establish and financially support recycling initiatives, partnering with other entities throughout the supply chain to improve the effectiveness of recycling efforts, reducing the weight of glass packaging and investing in research and development to reduce energy consumption in its manufacturing process. The Company invests in technology and training to improve safety, reduce energy use, decrease emissions and increase the amount of cullet, or recycled glass, used in the production process.
In addition, the Company is committed to ensuring the health and safety of its employees, as well as contractors and visitors in all of the Company’s facilities. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. The coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic has underscored the importance of keeping the Company’s employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.
The Company’s worldwide operations, in addition to other companies within the industry, are subject to extensive laws, ordinances, regulations and other legal requirements relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties as well as water discharges, air emissions, waste management and workplace health and safety. The Company strives to abide by and uphold such laws and regulations.
Glass Recycling, Deposit Return Systems, and Extended Producer Responsibility
The Company is an important contributor to recycling efforts worldwide and is among the largest users of recycled glass. If sufficient high-quality recycled glass were available on a consistent basis, the Company has the technology to make glass containers containing a high proportion of recycled glass. Using recycled glass in the manufacturing process reduces energy costs and impacts the operating life and efficiency of the glass melting furnaces.
In the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere, government authorities have adopted or are considering legal requirements, including Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) frameworks. EPR and other packaging 

5



recycling regulations may impose fees, mandate certain recycling rates, require minimum use of recycled materials, or result in limitations on or preferences for certain types of packaging. The Company believes that governments worldwide will continue to develop and enact legal requirements guiding customer and end-consumer packaging choices.
Sales of beverage containers are affected by governmental regulation of packaging, including deposit-return system (“DRS”) laws and EPR regulations. As of December 31, 2020, there were a number of U.S. states, Canadian provinces and territories and European countries with some form of legal regulation that imposes fees on producers or consumers of various packaging, including glass containers. The structure and enforcement of such laws and regulations can impact the sales of beverage containers in a given jurisdiction. Such laws and regulations also impact the availability of post-consumer recycled glass for the Company to use in container production.
Countries, states, and localities in all geographies in which the Company operates have recently considered or are now considering new EPR regulations, various laws and regulations to change curbside recycling, modify or create DRS laws, and create alternatives to traditional recycling systems. Although there is no clear trend in the direction of these various activities, the Company believes these legal and regulatory activities will impact the price and supply of recycled glass. As a large user of recycled glass for making new glass containers, the Company has an interest in laws and regulations impacting the supply of such material in its markets.
Climate Change and Air Emissions
Governments globally are increasingly considering a variety of mandatory or voluntary (e.g. Paris Climate Accord) climate-change or environmental regulatory and legal requirements. The Company is unable to predict what climate-change or environmental legal requirements may be adopted in the future. However, the Company continually monitors its operations in relation to climate-change risks and environmental impacts and invests in environmentally friendly and emissions-reducing projects. As such, the Company has made significant expenditures for environmental improvements at certain of its facilities over the last several years; however, these expenditures did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The Company is unable to predict the impact of future environmental legal requirements on its results of operations or cash flows.
In Europe, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme is in effect to facilitate emissions reduction. The Company’s manufacturing facilities which operate in EU countries must restrict the volume of their CO2 emissions to the level of their individually allocated emissions allowances as set by country regulators. If the actual level of emissions for any facility exceeds its allocated allowance, additional allowances can be bought to cover deficits; conversely, if the actual level of emissions for any facility is less than its allocation, the excess allowances can be sold. Should the regulators significantly restrict the number of emissions allowances available, it could have a material effect on the Company’s results.
In the Americas, the U.S. and Canada have engaged in significant legislative and regulatory activities relating to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions for years at the federal, state and provincial levels of government. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) regulates emissions of GHG air pollutants under the Clean Air Act, which grants the EPA authority to establish limits for certain air pollutants and to require compliance, levy penalties and bring civil judicial action against violators. The EPA’s GHG regulations continue to evolve, as the structure and scope of the regulations are often the subject of litigation and federal legislative activity. New GHG regulations in any country or state in the U.S. where the Company operates could have a significant long-term impact on the Company’s operations that are affected by such regulations. The state of California in the U.S., the Canadian federal government and the province of Quebec have adopted cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing GHG emissions. In Mexico and other South American countries, national and local governments are also considering potential regulations to reduce GHG emissions.
Workplace Safety
In the U.S., the Company is subject to various state and federal regulatory agencies, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), that assure safe and healthy working conditions by 

6



setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance. Similar regulatory agencies focused on employee safety exist in other countries in which the Company operates around the world. 
The Company is unable to predict what workplace safety legal requirements may be adopted in the future. However, the Company continually monitors its operations in relation to workplace safety and invests in projects to enhance employee safety. As such, the Company has made significant expenditures for workplace safety improvements at certain of its facilities over the last several years; however, these expenditures did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The Company expects to see continued improvement in health and safety as a result of these projects. The Company is unable to predict the impact of future health and safety legal requirements on its results of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital Resources
 The Company’s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit the Company’s operations and performance. The Company has approximately 25,000 employees and 72 plants spread across 20 countries. Led by its people’s knowledge and ambition, the Company is innovating to meet its customers’ ever-evolving needs to help build their brands and become valued partners. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, the Company provides a safe, inclusive, diverse, motivating and collaborative work environment with opportunities for its employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between its employees and their communities.
 The Company is committed to a culture of respect and integrity and believes it is better when it reflects the diversity of the world it serves, leading to a broader range of perspectives that yield superior decisions and outcomes. The Company is expanding its employee development programs, with significant focus on leadership development and a greater level of diversity. The Company is focused on increasing all aspects of diversity across its management team, which includes taking steps to increase the representation of women in senior leadership roles. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, the Company surveys employees with the assistance of third-party consultants, and takes actions to address areas of employee concern.
​
 A significant portion of the Company’s employees in the Americas are hourly workers covered by collective bargaining agreements. In Europe, a large number of the Company’s employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require the Company to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. The Company considers its employee relations to be good and does not anticipate any material work stoppages in the near term.
​
 The Company continues to emphasize collaboration, leveraging its knowledge and expertise, increasing accountability, and aligning incentives with the right results, with a focus on one team, one enterprise and one plan. The Company believes successful execution along these lines will lead to enhanced value for share owners, customers, and employees. ​
