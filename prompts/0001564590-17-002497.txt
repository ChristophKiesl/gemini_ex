ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (“AWI” or the “Company”) is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1891.  When we refer to “we,” “our” and “us” in this report, we are referring to AWI and its subsidiaries.
 We are a leading global producer of ceiling systems and, prior to April 1, 2016, flooring products for use primarily in the construction and renovation of residential, commercial and institutional buildings. We design, manufacture and sell ceiling systems (primarily mineral fiber, fiberglass wool and metal) and, prior to April 1, 2016, flooring products (primarily resilient and wood) around the world.
 On April 1, 2016, we completed our previously announced separation of Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (“AFI”) by allocating the assets and liabilities related primarily to the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments to AFI and then distributing the common stock of AFI to our shareholders at a ratio of one share of AFI common stock for every two shares of AWI common stock.  Subsequent to the separation and distribution, AWI and AFI operate as two independent, publicly-traded companies, with AFI owning and operating the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments and AWI continuing to own and operate the Building Products (Ceilings) segment.  AFI’s historical financial results have been reflected in AWI’s Consolidated Financial Statements as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.  See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 We are focused on driving sustainable shareholder value creation. Our strategic priorities are to accelerate profitable volume growth globally and to improve the returns in our international business.  Our primary goal is to expand into new and grow in existing markets by selling a broader array of products and solutions into those markets.  
 Reportable Segments
 Effective April 1, 2016 and in connection with our separation of AFI, our former Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments have been excluded from our results of continuing operations.  In addition, effective April 1, 2016, we disaggregated our former Building Products operating segment into the following three distinct geographical segments:  Americas (including Canada); Europe, Middle East and Africa (including Russia) (“EMEA”); and Pacific Rim.  See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information on our reportable segments.
Markets
 We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The major markets in which we compete are:
 North American Commercial.  Many of our products are used in commercial and institutional buildings.  Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings.  Renovation work is estimated to represent the majority of the total North American commercial market opportunity.  Most of our revenue comes from four major segments of commercial building – office, education, retail and healthcare.  We monitor U.S. construction starts and follow project activity.  Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as 18 to 24 months.  We also monitor office vacancy rates, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities.  We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction.  However, we believe that consumers’ preferences for product type, style, color, availability, affordability and ease of installation also affect our revenue.
 North American Residential.  Our Americas segment sells products for use in single and multi-family housing.  Our products compete against mineral fiber and fiberglass products from other manufacturers, as well as drywall.  We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products.  We estimate that existing home renovation (also known as replacement / remodel) work represents the majority of the total North American residential market opportunity.  Key U.S. statistics that indicate market opportunity include existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence.  
 Outside of North America.  About 30% of our 2016 consolidated sales were in EMEA and the Pacific Rim and almost all were commercial in nature.  For the countries in which we have significant revenue, we monitor various national statistics (such as GDP) as well as construction data (starts and project-related information).  Revenues come primarily from new construction and renovation work.

The following table provides an estimate of our major markets that affected 2016 net sales.
 
 
(Estimated percentages of individual segment’s sales) | North American Residential | | | North American Commercial | | Outside of North America | | 
------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+---+---+---------------------------+---+--------------------------+------------+--
 | New | | | Renovation | | New | Renovation | | New | | | Renovation | | Total
Americas | | 0 | % | | 5 | % | 20 | % | | 75 | % | | 0 | % | 0 | % | 100 | %
EMEA | | - | | | - | | - | | | - | | | 55 | % | 45 | % | 100 | %
Pacific Rim | | - | | | - | | - | | | - | | | 80 | % | 20 | % | 100 | %
Total | | 0 | % | | 5 | % | 15 | % | | 50 | % | | 20 | % | 10 | % | 100 | %

 
Management has used estimates in creating the table above because the end-use of our products is not easily determinable.
 Geographic Areas
 See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information by geographic areas.
Customers
 We use our reputation, capabilities, service and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers.  We principally sell commercial products to building materials distributors, who re-sell our products to contractors, subcontractors’ alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners. In our North American retail channel, which sells to end-users in the residential and light commercial segments, we have important relationships with national home centers such as Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and The Home Depot, Inc., as well as wholesalers who re-sell our products to dealers who service builders, contractors and consumers. 
 Approximately 80% of our consolidated net sales are to distributors.  Sales to large home centers account for less than 10% of our consolidated sales.  Our remaining sales are to contractors and retailers.
 Revenues from two commercial distributors, included within our Americas segment, individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2016.  Net sales in 2016 to these two customers totaled $284.0 million.  Net sales of $131.7 million from one of these customers also exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2015.  No one customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated net sales in 2014.  
 Working Capital
 We produce goods for inventory and sell on credit to our customers.  Generally, our distributors carry inventory as needed to meet local or rapid delivery requirements.  We sell the vast majority of our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future.  These practices are typical within the industry.  
Competition
 We face strong competition in all of our businesses.  Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price.  Competition in North America comes from both domestic and international manufacturers.  Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions.  Our products compete with drywall and exposed structure (also known as open plenum).  Excess industry capacity exists for certain products in some geographies, which tends to increase price competition.  The following companies are our primary competitors:
 CertainTeed Corporation (a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain), Chicago Metallic Corporation (owned by Rockwool International), Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Knauf AMF GmbH & Co. KG, Lafarge SA, Odenwald Faserplattenwerk GmbH, Rockfon A/S (owned by Rockwool International), Saint-Gobain and USG Corporation.

Raw Materials
 We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business.  The principal raw materials include: mineral fiber, fiberglass, perlite, waste paper, pigments, clays and starches.  In addition, we use aluminum and steel in the production of metal ceilings and by WAVE, our joint venture that manufactures ceiling grid.
 We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity and natural gas, and water.
 In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all of our operations.  However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers.  There is no assurance that these raw materials will remain in adequate supply to us.
 Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically.  Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs.  Given the competitiveness of our markets, we may not be able to recover the increased manufacturing costs through increasing selling prices to our customers.
 Sourced Products
 Some of the products that we sell are sourced from third parties.  Our primary sourced products include specialty ceiling products.  We purchase some of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from the Pacific Rim and Europe.  Sales of sourced products represented approximately 10% of our total consolidated revenue in 2016.
 In general, we believe we have adequate supplies of sourced products.  However, we cannot guarantee that the supply will remain adequate.
 Seasonality
 Generally, our sales in North America and Europe tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles, the timing of renovation and new construction.  We see similar patterns with respect to our sales in the Pacific Rim, though the timing of the Chinese New Year can affect buying behaviors.
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
 Patent protection is important to our business.  Our competitive position has been enhanced by U.S. and foreign patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AWI or obtained through acquisitions and licenses.  In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.
 Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.  The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies.  Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not believe we are materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets.
 Certain of our trademarks, including without limitation,  , Armstrong®, BioGuard™, Calla®, Cirrus®, Cortega®, Dune™, Huiyi™, Humiguard®, Infusions®, Lyra®, MetalWorks™,  Optima®, Perla™, Soundscapes®, Total Acoustics™,  Ultima®, and WoodWorks®, are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition.  Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as the mark is used, and continues in other countries as long as the mark is registered.  Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.
 In connection with the separation and distribution of AFI, we entered into several agreements with AFI that, together with a plan of division, provided for the separation and allocation of assets between AWI and AFI.  These agreements include a Trademark License Agreement and a Transition Trademark License Agreement.  Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, AWI provided AFI with a perpetual, royalty-free license to utilize the “Armstrong” trade name and logo.  Pursuant to the Transition Trademark License Agreement, AFI provided us with a five-year royalty-free license to utilize the “Inspiring Great Spaces” tagline, logo and related color scheme.

We review the carrying value of trademarks annually for potential impairment.  See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3,700 full-time and part-time employees worldwide compared to approximately 3,800 (excluding AFI) as of December 31, 2015.  Effective April 1, 2016, approximately 3,900 of our former employees were employed by AFI as a result of the separation.
As of December 31, 2016, approximately 73% of our 940 production employees in the U.S. were represented by labor unions.  Collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 300 employees at two U.S. plants will expire during 2017.  Outside the U.S., most of our production employees are covered by either industry-sponsored and/or state-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we idled one of our plants in China.  As a result, we expect a reduction of approximately 190 employees in China in the first quarter of 2017.  We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 
 Research & Development
 Research and development (“R&D”) activities are important and necessary in helping us improve our products’ competitiveness.  Principal R&D functions include the development and improvement of products and manufacturing processes.  We incurred $18.8 million in 2016, $19.7 million in 2015 and $19.8 million in 2014 of R&D expenses worldwide. 
Sustainability and Environmental Matters
 The adoption of environmentally responsible building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council, has the potential to increase demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the award of LEED credits, and we are continuing to develop new products, systems and services to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market products with an increased focus on sustainability.
 We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet evolving regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products, systems and services to our customers will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.  We are committed to complying with all environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations.
 Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
 Regulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and state Superfund and similar type environmental laws governing existing or potential environmental contamination at several domestically owned, formerly owned and non-owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity.  In a few cases, we are one of several Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs”) and have agreed to jointly fund required investigation, while preserving our defenses to the liability.  We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.  
 Most of our manufacturing and certain of our research facilities are affected by various federal, state and local environmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials or the protection of the environment.  We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations.
 We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with distributors, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. From time to time, for example, we may be a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and other claims under a wide range of allegations, including illness due to exposure to certain chemicals used in the workplace; or medical conditions arising from exposure to product ingredients or the presence of trace contaminants.  Such allegations may involve multiple defendants and relate to legacy products that we and other defendants purportedly manufactured or sold. We believe that any current claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. For these matters, we also may have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under 
 7


applicable insurance policies.  When applicable and appropriate, we will pursue coverage and recoveries under those policies, but are unable to predict the outcome of those demands.  While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 Liabilities of $4.7 million and $6.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were recorded for potential environmental liabilities and relating to locations for which we are a PRP that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made.  See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for information regarding the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
