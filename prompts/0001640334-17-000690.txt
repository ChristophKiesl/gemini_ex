Item 1. Business.
Corporate Background
 
Agro Capital Management Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 12, 2013 under the name Guate Tourism Inc. Until September 11, 2015, the Company operated an online tourist guide company in Guatemala. On September 11, 2015, our then largest shareholder, Ms. Blanca Bamaca, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with certain third party investors, whereby Ms. Bamaca sold 6 million shares of the Company’s common stock held by her, representing at the time 82.8% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Upon completion of the sale, the Company abandoned its business plan and sought an operating company with which to merge or to acquire. On October 29, 2015, Guate Tourism Inc. conducted a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agro Capital Management Corp. The subsidiary was not an operating company and held no assets. Guate Tourism Inc., as the surviving entity, changed its name in connection therewith to Agro Capital Management Corp. The Company also amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the Company’s authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 300 million and increase the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split of such shares at the rate of ten shares for every one share then issued and outstanding . 
 
On December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Capital Epitome Sdn Bhd, a private Malaysian corporation (“Capital Epitome”), and Mr. Mohd Nasir Bin Baba, a Malaysian citizen (“Mr. Nasir”), whereby the Company agreed to issue 30 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Agro Capital Management Berhad, a Malaysian corporation (“Agro Malaysia”). 
 
On September 19, 2016, the Company, Capital Epitome and Mr. Nasir rescinded the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Mutual Rescission”) due to, among other reasons, the lack of currently available information regarding Agro Malaysia necessary for the Company to complete a full financial audit of Agro Malaysia for the two prior fiscal years. In connection with the rescission of the Share Exchange Agreement, we returned all of the shares of Agro Malaysia held by us to Capital Epitome and Mr. Nasir and, simultaneously, Capital Epitome and Mr. Nasir returned all of the shares of the Company held by them to the Company for cancellation. 
 
Mr. Michael Xavier Dorairaj and Mr. Michael Marcus Liew are former directors of Capital Epitome. At the time of the Share Exchange Agreement and the Mutual Rescission, Mr. Michael Xavier Dorairaj and Mr. Michael Marcus Liew, two of our directors, were not directors of Capital Epitome.

Business Overview
 
Agro Capital Management Corp. is a shell company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no or nominal assets and no or nominal operations.
 
The Company’s current business plan is to enter into a merger, acquisition or other business venture with Agro Malaysia or other companies in the aqua-culture development industry in Malaysia. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in either consummating a transaction with Agro Malaysia or identifying or negotiating a business transaction with another company, or, if we do enter into a business transaction with Agro Malaysia or another company, no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business transaction, or as to the nature of the target company. 
 
Employees 
 
We have no employees other than our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Christopher Xavier Dorairaj, who currently devotes approximately ten to fifteen hours per week to matters related to the Company. As our business expands, Mr. Dorairaj intends to devote as much time as the board of directors deems necessary to manage the affairs of the Company. He is not being paid at present.
Competition
 There are many established aqua-culture companies and other investment firms which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources, technical expertise and experience than the Company. In view of the Company’s limited financial resources and management availability, the Company will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis the Company’s competitors.
