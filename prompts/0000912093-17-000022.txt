ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
Overview
Viavi Solutions Inc. (“Viavi,” also referred to as “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”), formerly JDS Uniphase Corporation (“JDSU”), is a global provider of network test, monitoring and assurance solutions to communications service providers, enterprises and their ecosystems, supported by a worldwide channel community including Viavi Velocity Solution Partners. Our Velocity program (“Velocity”) allows us to optimize the use of direct or partner sales depending on application and sales volume. Velocity expands our reach into new market segments as well as expands our capability to sell and deliver solutions. Our solutions deliver end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks, enabling customers to optimize connectivity, quality of experience and profitability. Viavi is also a leader in high performance thin film optical coatings, providing light management solutions to anti-counterfeiting, consumer and industrial, government and healthcare and other markets. On August 1, 2015, we completed the separation (“Separation”) of our optical components and lasers business and created two publicly-traded companies: 

• | an optical components and commercial lasers company, Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“Lumentum”), consisting of our former Communications and Commercial Optical Products (“CCOP”) segment and the WaveReady product line within our Network Enablement (“NE”) segment; and


• | a network and service enablement and optical coatings company, renamed Viavi, consisting of our NE, Service Enablement (“SE”) and Optical Security and Performance Products (“OSP”) segments.

In connection with the Separation we distributed approximately 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Lumentum common stock to our stockholders on August 1, 2015. The Company was renamed Viavi and, at the time of the distribution, retained ownership of approximately 19.9% of Lumentum’s outstanding shares. Activities related to the Lumentum business have been presented as discontinued operations in all periods of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying disclosures, discussion and analysis herein pertains to the Company’s continuing operations, unless noted otherwise.
To serve our markets, during fiscal 2017 we operated the following business segments:

• | Network Enablement


• | Service Enablement


• | Optical Security and Performance Products

Industry Trends
NE and SE
The telecommunication (“Telecom”) and cable industries are facing substantial business and technology disruptions that are transforming the users’ experience in accessing voice, data, social media and video content. Multiple network technologies are being deployed to meet the needs of increased network capacity and faster transmission speeds across both the physical and the virtual networks and across the airwaves. All forms of the network are being upgraded to faster speeds to achieve multi-gigabit per second (“Gbps”) broadband speeds and faster response time. 100G optical fiber is being deployed in the Metro networks. Optical is being delivered to fiber-to-the-home (“FTTH”) and permeating to everywhere. Cable service providers are investing in high speed connections and increased bandwidth availability with the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1. Telecom operators are upgrading legacy copper digital subscriber line (“DSL”) networks to G.fast technology. Over the airwaves, 4G/Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) wireless technology is expected to expand coverage with advanced LTE and 5G in the next couple years and provide 100x faster speeds than current LTE networks. 
With the growing number of connected smart mobile devices, the exponential growth in Internet of Things (“IOT”) devices, and demand for high-speed broadband access to support video and other high-bandwidth applications, capacity and intelligence are increasing at the edge of the network pushing the expansion of the overall network and larger links along with new networks requiring re-architecture for scalability and flexibility. This increased demand for capacity will require networks to be more agile, flexible, programmable and more cost effective. It also will drive the network transition from a hardware-centric approach to a hybrid of physical and virtualized software-centric approach through software defined networking (“SDN”) and network function virtualization (“NFV”). Long term, network providers are pursuing automation to provide enhanced offerings including machine to machine communications, connected cars, mobile payment and security.

The convergence of network technologies requires sizable investments from communication service providers (“CSPs”), which consist of telecommunications, cable and cloud service providers. In order to achieve scale and a profitable return on investment, the telecom and cable industries in recent years are experiencing increased consolidation. New entrants have emerged with the rise of cloud service providers, who are increasing their capital expenditures and investing in advanced networks as enterprises are off-loading private corporate networks to the cloud. Traditional service provider capital spending in physical networks has been declining, which impacts the served available market opportunity for our NSE segment. However, the emergence of cloud service providers and virtualized networks create new opportunities for NSE. We believe our NE and SE products and solutions are well positioned to meet these rapidly changing industry trends, given our technology, installed base and product offerings.
OSP
Counterfeiting of banknotes and other goods is on the rise because counterfeiters now have access to a broad range of advanced but relatively low-cost imaging technologies and printing tools giving them the ability to create convincing simulations of actual documents and products for illicit purposes. At the same time, the penalties for counterfeiting can often be relatively modest when compared to the penalties for other crimes. We have decades of anti-counterfeiting expertise leveraging our Optically Variable Pigment (“OVP®”), and more recently our Optically Variable Magnetic Pigment (“OVMP®”) technologies to protect the integrity of banknotes and other high-value documents by delivering optical effects that are very easy for consumers to recognize but also very difficult for counterfeiters to reproduce. We also provide optical technologies for government, healthcare, consumer electronics and industrial markets.
In addition to anti-counterfeiting solutions, we extend our technology expertise to solve complex problems and deliver unique solutions in other industries. For example, we manufacture and sell optical filters for 3D sensing products that separate out ambient light from incoming data to allow devices to be controlled by a person’s movements or gestures.
Sales and Marketing
CSPs make up the majority of NE and SE revenues. We also market and sell our products to network-equipment manufacturers ("NEMs"), original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), enterprises, governmental organizations, distributors and strategic partners worldwide. We have a dedicated sales force organized around the markets our segments serve that works directly with customers’ executive, technical, manufacturing and purchasing personnel to determine design, performance, and cost requirements. We are also supported by a worldwide channel community, including Viavi’s Velocity Solution Partners who support our NE and SE segments.
A high level of support is a critical part of our strategy to develop and maintain long-term collaborative relationships with our customers. We develop innovative products by engaging our customers at the initial design phase and continue to build that relationship as our customers’ needs change and develop. Service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners worldwide.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in California in 1979 as Uniphase Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1993. We are the product of several significant mergers and acquisitions including, among others, the combination of Uniphase Corporation and JDS FITEL in 1999. In 2000 we acquired Optical Coatings Lab, Inc., which is currently part of our OSP business, and in 2005 we acquired Acterna, Inc. which is currently part of our Network and Service Enablement (“NSE”) business, which consists of our NE and SE segments. Following these acquisitions, we operated as a company comprised of a portfolio of businesses with a focus on optical innovation, communications network and service enablement, commercial lasers and anti-counterfeiting solutions. In August 2015, we separated our portfolio of businesses into two separate publicly-traded companies to gain greater strategic flexibility to address rapidly changing market dynamics. At the same time, we changed our name to Viavi Solutions Inc. Our headquarters are located at 430 North McCarthy Boulevard, Milpitas, CA 95035, and our telephone number is (408) 404-3600. Our website address is www.viavisolutions.com.

Corporate Strategy
Our objective is to continue to be a leading provider for all markets and industries we serve. In support of our business segments, we are pursuing a corporate strategy that we believe will best position us for future opportunities as follows:

• | Market leadership in physical and virtualized test and measurement instruments with opportunity to grow market share


• | Market leadership in anti-counterfeiting pigments


• | Acceleration in OSP growth through diversification in high value applications


• | Increase the benefit from the use of our net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL”) by improving our profitability organically and inorganically


• | Greater flexibility in capital structure enabling greater capital return to shareholders

Our long term capital allocation strategy, which supports our corporate strategy, is as follows:

• | Maintenance and run-rate investments to support operational and capital spending


• | Organic investments in initiatives to support revenue growth and productivity


• | Return capital to shareholders through share buybacks


• | Mergers and acquisition that are synergistic to company strategy and business segments

Although we expect to successfully implement our strategy, internal and/or external factors could impact our ability to meet any, or all, of our objectives. These factors are discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors.
Business Segments
Following the Separation of the Lumentum business on August 1, 2015, we operated in two broad business categories: NSE and OSP. NSE operates in two reportable segments, NE and SE, whereas OSP operates as a single segment. Our NSE and OSP businesses each are organized with its own engineering, manufacturing and dedicated sales and marketing groups focused on each of the markets we serve to better support our customers and respond quickly to market needs. In addition, our segments share common corporate services that provide capital, infrastructure, resources and functional support, allowing them to focus on core technological strengths to compete and innovate in their markets.
The table below discloses the percentage of our total net revenue attributable to each of our three reportable segments.

 | Years Ended 
 | July 1, 2017 | | July 2, 2016 | | June 27, 2015
Network Enablement | 54.7 | % | | 55.7 | % | 58.0 | %
Service Enablement | 16.7 | | | 16.9 | | 19.9 | 
Optical Security and Performance Products | 28.6 | | | 27.4 | | 22.1 | 

Network Enablement
Our NE segment provides an integrated portfolio of testing solutions that access the network to perform build-out and maintenance tasks.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we re-grouped our NE products and associated services from three product groupings to two as described below:
Field Instruments: Primarily consisting of (a) Access and Cable products; (b) Fiber Instrument products; (c) Metro products; and (d) RF Test products.
Lab Instruments: Primarily consisting of (a) Capacity Advisor products; (b) Fiber Optic Production Lab Test; (c) Optical Transport products; and (d) Storage Network Test products.
Additionally, following the Separation we no longer sell products or services from the WaveReady product line. 
 For the purposes of providing year-over-year variance analysis in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reflected these changes for all prior periods presented so that they are comparable with our current groupings.
Service Enablement
SE provides embedded systems and enterprise performance management solutions that give global CSPs, enterprises and cloud operators visibility into network, service and application data. These solutions - which primarily consist of instruments, microprobes and software - monitor, collect and analyze network data to reveal the actual customer experience and identify opportunities for new revenue streams and network optimization.
Our portfolio of SE solutions addresses the same lab and production environments, field deployment and service assurance for wireless and fixed communications networks, including storage networks, as our NE portfolio. Our solutions let carriers remotely monitor performance and quality of network, service and applications performance throughout the entire network. This provides our customers with enhanced network management, control, and optimization that allow network operators to initiate service to new customers faster, decrease the need for technicians to make on-site service calls, help to make necessary repairs faster and, as a result, lower costs while providing higher quality and more reliable services. Remote monitoring decreases operating expenses, while early detection helps increase uptime, preserve revenue, and helps operators better monetize their networks.
Markets
Our SE segment provides solutions and services primarily for communication service providers and enterprises that deliver and/or operate broadband/IP networks (fixed and mobile) supporting voice, video and data services as well as a wide range of applications. These solutions provide network and application visibility to enable more cost-effective ways to provide a higher-quality customer experience.
Customers
SE customers include similar CSPs, NEMs, government organizations, large corporate customers, and storage-segment customers that are served by our NE segment.
Trends
Our Service Enablement solutions portfolio grew as a result of several acquisitions made during the past several years to address the network industry shift to a more agile, flexible, programmable, and cost-effective virtualized software-centric network. Our Data Center (formerly called Enterprise) product and solutions offerings address customers’ needs to support data center network traffic through application and performance monitoring.
While the network industry is shifting towards SDN and NFV, in fiscal 2016 we experienced a decline in SE net revenue compared to fiscal 2015 and certain growth products will require a longer investment cycle than originally expected. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $91.4 million related to our SE segment in fiscal 2016. Refer to “Note 8. Goodwill” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Strategy
Consistent with the communication on our last Analyst Day on September 15, 2016, we have taken steps to follow the “Big NE, Focused SE” strategy to emphasize Virtualized Instruments and Assurance and invest in areas of tight integration and synergies with NE to align with industry macro trends and focus the SE portfolio on products and solutions we believe will provide meaningful return on investment (“ROI”) and drive profitability.

Competition
Our NE and SE segments compete against many of the same companies. Competitors of SE include NetScout Systems, Inc. Riverbed Technology, and Spirent Communications plc. While we face multiple competitors for each of our product families, we continue to have one of the broadest portfolios of wireline and wireless monitoring solutions available in the service enablement industry.
Offerings
Viavi’s SE solutions are embedded network systems-including microprobes and software-that collect and analyze network data to reveal the actual customer experience and identify opportunities for new revenue streams. These solutions provide enhanced network management, control, optimization and differentiation for our customers. Using these solutions, our customers are able to access and analyze the growing amount of network data from a single console, simplifying the process of deploying, provisioning and managing network equipment and services. These capabilities allow network operators to initiate service to new customers faster, decrease the need for technicians to make on-site service calls, help to make necessary repairs faster and, as a result, lower costs while providing higher quality and more reliable services.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we re-grouped our SE products and associated services from three product groupings to two as described below:
Data Center: Consisting of our Network Instrument products.
Assurance: Primarily consisting of our (a) Mature Products (Legacy Assurance, Legacy Wireline, Protocol Test, Video Assurance products and RAN (formerly component of Wireless)) (b) Growth Products (Xsight, Packet Portal products, Location Intelligence (formerly components of Wireless)).
For the purposes of providing year-over-year variance analysis in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reflected these changes for all prior periods presented so that they are comparable with our current groupings.
In the second half fiscal 2017, Viavi implemented our Focused NSE restructuring plan as part of its strategy to improve profitability in the Company’s NSE business by narrowing the scope and focus of the SE business. The smaller, more focused SE segment includes Data Center products, mobile assurance products like Xsight and Location Intelligence and invest in development of automation and virtualized network. The SE segment also retains the more mature Assurance product portfolio that is largely maintenance and service contract.
Optical Security and Performance Products
Our OSP segment leverages its core optical coating technologies and volume manufacturing capability to design, manufacture, and sell products targeting anti-counterfeiting, consumer and industrial, government, healthcare and other markets.
Our security offerings for the currency market include OVP®, OVMP® and banknote thread substrates. OVP® enables a color-shifting effect used by banknote issuers and security printers worldwide for anti-counterfeiting applications on banknotes and other high-value documents. Our technologies are deployed on the banknotes of more than 100 countries today. OSP also develops and delivers overt and covert anti-counterfeiting products that utilize its proprietary printing platform and are targeted primarily at the pharmaceutical and consumer-electronics markets.
Leveraging our expertise in spectral management and our unique high-precision coating capabilities, OSP provides a range of products and technologies for the consumer and industrial market, including, for example, 3D sensing optical filters.

Customers
OSP serves customers such as 3M Company, FLIR Systems, Inc., IDT Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Seiko Epson Corporation, SICPA Holding SA Company (SICPA) and STMicroelectronics Holding N.V.. Following the separation from Lumentum, one OSP customer generated more than 10% of Viavi net revenue from continuing operations. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenue from SICPA represented 20.6%, 21.0% and 16.4%, respectively, of Viavi net revenue from continuing operations.
Trends
Counterfeiting of banknotes and other goods is on the rise because counterfeiters now have access to a broad range of advanced but relatively low-cost imaging technologies and printing tools, giving them the ability to create convincing simulations of actual documents and products for illicit purposes. At the same time, the penalties for counterfeiting can often be relatively modest when compared to the penalties for other crimes. As a result of these trends, demand is increasing for sophisticated overt anti-counterfeiting features, such as Viavi’s OVP® and OVMP® technologies, which are easy for consumers to validate without the use of special tools but are difficult to create or simulate using conventional printing technology.
The aerospace, defense, consumer electronics and medical/environmental instrumentation markets require customized, high-precision coated products and optical components that selectively absorb, transmit or reflect light to meet the performance requirements of sophisticated systems. Our custom optics products offer an array of advanced technologies and precision optics-from the UV to the far IR portion of the light spectrum to meet the specific requirements of our customers.
3D sensing is an emerging technology, where OSP’s optical filters plan to be deployed in smartphones for facial recognition biometric authentication. 3D sensing optical filters separate out ambient light from incoming data to allow devices to be controlled by a person’s movements, gestures or features. Other potential technology markets for OSP’s optical filters include augmented/virtual reality, sensors deployed in autonomous vehicles and Internet of Things (IoT).
Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage proprietary pigments and optical coating technologies to build market leadership in large, high value applications.

• | Defend and expand core anti-counterfeiting product offering


• | Expand into high value existing and emerging automotive, military and industrial applications


• | Selectively target high volume consumer 3D sensing applications

Competition
OSP’s competitors include providers of anti-counterfeiting features such as Giesecke & Devrient, De La Rue plc; special-effect pigments like Merck KGA; coating companies such as Nidek, Toppan, and Toray and optics companies such as Materion and Deposition Sciences.

The addition of Trendium employees and technology enabled the Company to introduce a new paradigm of CEA in our Assurance solutions, enabling operators of 4G/LTE networks to achieve a real and relevant improvement in customer satisfaction while maximizing productivity and profitability for dynamic converged 4G/LTE networks and beyond. We acquired certain technology and other assets from Trendium for a total purchase price of approximately $26.1 million in cash. This acquisition was integrated into SE segment.
Restructuring Programs
We continue to engage in targeted restructuring events intended to consolidate our operations, and align our businesses in response to market conditions and our current investment strategy. In fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring plan within the NE and SE business segments as part of our continued strategy to improve profitability in NSE business by narrowing the scope of the SE business and reducing costs by streamlining NSE operations. We also continued to restructure and reorganize our segments to eliminate certain positions by consolidating and shifting resources in our sales, manufacturing and R&D functions to focus on our strategic growth areas and optimize our operational efficiency.
Please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 and “Note 11. Restructuring and Related Charges” under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on these charges.
Research and Development
During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred R&D expenses of $136.3 million, $166.4 million, and $173.3 million, respectively. The number of employees engaged in R&D was approximately 600 as of July 1, 2017.
We devote substantial resources to R&D to develop new and enhanced products to serve our markets. Once the design of a product is complete, our engineering efforts shift to enhancing both product performance and our ability to manufacture it in greater volume and at lower cost.
In our NE and SE segments, we develop portable test instruments for field service technicians, systems and software used in Network Operations Centers, and instruments used in the development, testing and production of communications network components, modules and equipment. We are increasing our focus on IP-based service assurance and customer experience management, and test instruments for wireless networks and services, while continuing to develop tools for fiber optic, optical transport, Ethernet, broadband access, video test and storage network testing. We have centers of excellence for product marketing and development in Asia, Europe and North America.
In our OSP segment, our R&D efforts concentrate on developing more innovative technologies and products for customers in the anti-counterfeiting, consumer electronics, government, healthcare and automotive markets. Our strength in the banknote anti-counterfeiting market is complemented by our advances in developing novel pigments and foils for a variety of applications. Other areas of R&D focus for OSP include our efforts to leverage our optical coating technology expertise to develop applications 
10

for the government and defense markets as well as efforts related to new products for 3D sensing and smart phone sensors. OSP has also introduced an innovative handheld spectrometer solution with applications in the agriculture, healthcare and defense markets.
Manufacturing
As of July 1, 2017 significant manufacturing facilities for our NE, SE and OSP segments were located in China, France, Germany, Korea and the United States and our significant contract manufacturing partners were located in China and Mexico.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Viavi uses various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of multiple product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Intellectual property rights apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of July 1, 2017, we owned approximately 740 U.S. patents and 1015 foreign patents and have 535 patent applications pending throughout the world.
Backlog
We consider our backlog balance to be an estimate of future revenue to be earned from contractually committed product and service arrangements. As of July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, our backlog was approximately $177 million and $234 million, respectively.
Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period.
Employees
We employed approximately 2,700 employees as of July 1, 2017, which included approximately 900 employees in manufacturing, 600 employees in R&D, 750 employees in sales and marketing, and 450 employees in general and administration. This compared to a workforce of approximately 3,000 as of July 2, 2016, and 4,900 as of June 27, 2015 which also included employees who transferred to Lumentum as part of the Separation. On August 1, 2015, approximately 1,700 employees were transferred to Lumentum as part of the separation of the Lumentum business which included approximately 850 employees from manufacturing, 550 employees from R&D, 150 employees from sales and marketing and 150 employees from general and administration.
Similar to other technology companies, we rely upon our ability to use “Full Value Awards” (as defined below) and other forms of stock-based compensation as key components of our executive and employee compensation structure. Full Value Awards refer to Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) and performance-based RSUs that are granted with the exercise price equal to zero and are converted to shares immediately upon vesting. The performance-based RSUs are also referred to as Market Stock Units (“MSUs”) and have vesting requirements tied to the performance of the Company’s stock as compared to the NASDAQ telecommunications index, and could vest at a higher or lower rate or not at all, based on this relative performance. Historically, these components have been critical to our ability to retain important personnel and offer competitive compensation packages. Without these components, we would be required to significantly increase cash compensation levels or develop alternative compensation structures to retain our key employees.
Outside of the United States, our businesses are subject to labor laws that differ from those in the United States. The Company follows statutory requirements, and in certain European countries it is common for a works council, consisting of elected employees, to represent the sites when discussing matters such as compensation, benefits or terminations of employment. We consider our employee relations to be good.
