Item 1. Business
The terms “Company,” “RPT,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to RPT Realty, RPT Realty, L.P., and/or their subsidiaries, as the context may require. The content of our website and the websites of third parties noted herein is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
General
RPT Realty owns and operates a national portfolio of open-air shopping destinations principally located in top U.S. markets. The Company's shopping centers offer diverse, locally-curated consumer experiences that reflect the lifestyles of their surrounding communities and meet the modern expectations of the Company's retail partners. The Company is a fully integrated and self-administered REIT publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). The common shares of beneficial interest of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “common shares”), are listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RPT”. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's property portfolio (the “aggregate portfolio”) consisted of 44 wholly-owned shopping centers, 13 shopping centers owned through its grocery anchored joint venture, 48 retail properties owned through its net lease joint venture and one net lease retail property that was held for sale by the Company which together represent 15.0 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”). As of December 31, 2022, the Company's pro-rata share of the aggregate portfolio was 93.8% leased.
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1002, New York, New York 10036 and its telephone number is (212) 221-1261. The Company’s website is rptrealty.com.
We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, RPT Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”).  The Operating Partnership, either directly or indirectly through partnerships or limited liability companies, holds fee title to all of our properties.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership.  As of December 31, 2022, we owned approximately 98.2% of the Operating Partnership.  The interests of the limited partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements and the limited partners are generally individuals or entities that contributed interests in certain assets or entities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”).  The holders of OP Units are entitled to exchange them for our common shares on a 1:1 basis or for cash.  The form of payment is at our election.
We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Certain of our operations, including property and asset management, as well as ownership of certain land parcels, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which are subject to federal and state income taxes.
Business Strategy
The Company's differentiated business model, which includes investment in two strategic joint ventures, has positioned itself to continue to meaningfully transform the portfolio, primarily focusing on major metropolitan U.S. markets in the Northeast and Southeast regions, which are supported by strong demographics, educational attainment, tech/life science/university adjacencies, pro-business environments and job growth. As a result of our continued portfolio refinement, the Company owns a predominantly grocery anchored portfolio in the top national markets which has enhanced the durability of our cashflows, while giving us the ability to remain opportunistic with value creation opportunities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company derived 96.5% of its annualized base rent from the top 40 national markets, such as Boston, Atlanta, Detroit and Nashville, in addition to several markets in Florida, including Tampa, Miami and Jacksonville.
Our primary business goals are to increase operating cash flows and deliver above average relative shareholder return. Specifically, we pursue the following methods to achieve these goals:
•Capitalize on accretive acquisition opportunities of open-air shopping centers through our complimentary joint venture platforms and balance sheet. We intend to pursue growth through the strategic acquisition of attractively priced open-air shopping centers and, in certain cases, sell certain separately subdivided single tenant parcels in the shopping center to our single tenant, net lease joint venture platform, highlighting the meaningful arbitrage opportunities that we can create for our shareholders.
•Acquire high quality open-air shopping centers and single tenant, net lease retail assets in the top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (“MSA”). Our data-driven and stringent criteria for acquisition opportunities include a strong demographic profile, educational attainment, tech/life science/university adjacencies, pro-business environments, job growth, high exposure to essential tenants, tenant credit/term and an attractive risk-adjusted return.
•Disciplined capital recycling strategy. We employ a data-driven and rigorous investment management strategy by selectively selling assets with returns and value that have been maximized and redeploying the capital into leasing, redevelopment, and acquisition of properties.
•Remerchandise and redevelop our assets. Our strategy is to strategically remerchandise and redevelop certain of our existing properties where we have significant pre-leasing and can improve tenant credit and term, enhance the merchandising mix or augment the consumer experience with an alternative non-retail use, while generating attractive returns, and driving meaningful value creation.
•Hands-on active asset management. We proactively manage our properties, employ data-driven targeted leasing strategies, maintain strong tenant relationships, drive rent and occupancy, focus on reducing operating expenses and property capital expenditures, and attract high quality and creditworthy tenants; all of which we believe enhances the value of our properties.
•Curate our real estate to align with the current and future shopping center landscape. We intend to leverage technology and data, optimize distribution points for brick-and-mortar and e-commerce purchases, engage in best-in-class sustainability programs and create an optimal merchandising mix to continue to attract and engage our shoppers.
•Maintain a strong, flexible and investment grade balance sheet. Our strategy is to maintain low leverage and high liquidity, proactively manage and stagger our debt maturities, limit exposure to floating interest rate risk and retain access to diverse sources of capital to support the business in any environment.
•Retain motivated, talented and high performing employees. To facilitate the attraction, retention and promotion of a talented and diverse workforce, we provide competitive compensation, best-in-class benefits and health and wellness programs, and champion programs that build connections between our employees and the communities where they live and at the properties we own.
Operating Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our operating objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return on invested capital at our shopping centers. We proactively manage our properties, employ data-drive targeted leasing strategies, maintain strong tenant relationships, drive rent and occupancy, focus on reducing operating expenses and property capital expenditures, and attract high quality and creditworthy tenants; all of which we believe enhances the value of our properties.
During 2022, our properties reported the following leasing activity, which is shown at pro-rata except for number of leasing transactions and square feet:

 | Leasing Transactions | Square Footage | Base Rent/SF (1) | Prior Rent/SF (2) | Tenant Improvements/SF (3) | Leasing Commissions/SF
Renewals | 202 | | 1,476,309 | | $16.79 | $15.76 | $1.72 | $0.11 
New Leases - Comparable | 19 | | 60,849 | | $29.97 | $21.02 | $73.42 | $15.71
Non-Comparable Transactions (4) | 86 | | 671,433 | | $17.02 | N/A | $57.45 | $6.53 
Total | 307 | | 2,208,591 | | $17.18 | N/A | $20.33 | $2.43 

(1) Base rent represents contractual minimum rent under the new lease for the first 12 months of the term. 
(2) Prior rent represents minimum rent, if any, paid by the prior tenant in the final 12 months of the term. 
(3) Includes estimated tenant improvement cost, tenant allowances, and landlord costs.
(4) Non-comparable lease transactions include (i) leases for space vacant for greater than 12 months and (ii) leases signed where the previous and current lease do not have a consistent lease structure.
Investing Activities and Significant Transactions
Our investment thesis is to acquire high quality open-air shopping centers and single tenant, net lease retail assets in the top U.S. MSA’s at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our data-driven and stringent criteria for acquisition opportunities include a strong demographic profile, educational attainment, tech/life science/university adjacencies, pro-business environments, job growth, high exposure to essential tenants and tenant credit/term. We also employ a disciplined data driven capital recycling strategy by selectively selling assets with returns and value that have been maximized and redeploying the capital into leasing, remerchandising, redevelopment, and acquisition of properties.

Refer to Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions by our unconsolidated joint ventures.
Financing Strategies and Significant Transactions
The strength and flexibility of the Company's balance sheet is core to its strategy. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity profile is evidenced by our investment grade credit ratings of BBB- from a nationally recognized credit rating agency. Our strategy is to maintain low leverage and high liquidity, proactively manage and stagger our debt maturities, limit exposure to floating interest rate risk and retain access to diverse sources of capital to support the business in any environment.
Debt
On August 2, 2022, the Company entered into amendments to the note purchase agreements governing all of the Operating Partnership's outstanding senior unsecured notes, with the holders of the outstanding notes, with the exception of the note purchase agreement relating to the Operating Partnership's (i) $75.0 million aggregate principle amount of 3.70% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series A, due November 30, 2030 and (ii) $55.0 million aggregate principle amount of 3.82% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series B, due November 30, 2031. These amendments modify certain covenants, including the removal of the restrictions on certain investments covenant and modification to the development activities covenant, increases on the minimum and maximum dollar thresholds included in events of default and modifications to related definitions contained in each of the note purchase agreements.
On August 18, 2022, the Operating Partnership entered into a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “credit agreement”) which amends and restates in its entirety the Operating Partnership's Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 6, 2019. The credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “revolving credit facility”) of up to $500.0 million and term loan facilities of $310.0 million (the “term loan facilities” and, together with the revolving credit facility, the “unsecured revolving line of credit”). Pursuant to the credit agreement, the Operating Partnership has the right, exercisable five times, to request increases to the revolving credit facility and term loan facilities or the making of additional term loans by up to $440.0 million to a maximum aggregate amount not to exceed $1.25 billion. The revolving credit facility matures on August 18, 2026 and can be extended for two additional consecutive periods of six-months, subject to continued compliance with the terms of the credit agreement and the payment of an extension fee of 0.0625%. Borrowings on the revolving credit facility are priced on a leverage grid ranging from SOFR (as defined herein) plus 105 basis points to SOFR plus 150 basis points and a 10 basis point SOFR Index adjustment.
On October 11, 2022, the Company repaid a mortgage note secured by The Shops on Lane Avenue totaling $27.2 million with an interest rate of 3.76%
In February 2022, our R2G joint venture closed on two new mortgages totaling $52.0 million, or $26.8 million at the Company's pro-rata share, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.88%.
At December 31, 2022, we had $465.0 million available to draw under our unsecured revolving line of credit, subject to compliance with applicable covenants. See the subsection “Debt” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below for additional discussion regarding the Company's outstanding financial covenants and related amendments thereto. 
Equity
In February 2020, the Company entered in to an Equity Distribution Agreement (“2020 Equity Distribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company could offer and sell, from time to time, the Company's common shares having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100.0 million (the “Prior ATM Program”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into forward sale agreements under the Prior ATM Program to sell an aggregate of 75,000 shares of common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled all forward sale agreements under the Prior ATM Program, receiving $1.0 million of gross proceeds before issuance costs, which were used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
In February 2022, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (“2022 Equity Distribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, the Company's common shares having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $150.0 million. In connection with the establishment of the Current ATM Program, the 2020 Equity Distribution Agreement was terminated effective February 18, 2022, and there will be no future issuances under the Prior ATM Program. Sales of the shares of common shares may be made, in the Company's discretion, from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2022 Equity Distribution Agreement also provides that the Company may enter into forward sale agreements for shares of its common shares with forward sellers and forward purchasers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 1,226,271 shares of its common stock, receiving $17.0 million of gross proceeds before issuance costs, which were used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, $133.0 million of common shares remained available for issuance under the Current ATM Program. The sale of such shares issuable pursuant to the Current ATM Program was registered with the SEC pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed in February 2022 and the accompanying base prospectus statement forming part of the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (No. 333-262871) which was filed with the SEC in February 2022.
Sustainability
We continue to advance our commitment to sustainability with a focus on each of the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) areas of sustainability. We believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of supporting our primary goal to maximize value for our shareholders. The following components are the foundation of our ESG program:
•Stakeholder Engagement: We maintain regular engagement with our various key stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, tenants, communities and vendors in order to report, discuss and highlight issues of importance, including ESG topics, to each of the stakeholder groups. 
•Environmental Stewards: We are focused on becoming model environmental stewards by implementing measures that will reduce our carbon footprint and consumption of natural resources. Our environmental sustainability initiatives aim to safeguard the environment and improve the energy efficiency of our portfolio and corporate office locations, while lowering operating costs.
•Employees: We strive to create an environment for our employees that results in high levels of employee satisfaction by focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion, health and well-being programs, employee development and training at all levels and equitable and competitive pay policies. Our employees also strive to give back to the communities in which we operate through charitable giving and volunteer opportunities.
•Governance: “Executing with Integrity” is one of our core values. We believe that good corporate governance will yield long-term success and create a culture of uncompromising integrity and transparency in all levels of our Company’s governance structure, reporting, business and transactions.
In 2022, we published our second annual Corporate Sustainability Report highlighting our 2021 initiatives, goals and achievements. More information about our corporate responsibility and ESG practices can be found on the Company’s website and in the Corporate Sustainability Report. The content of our website, including information relating to corporate responsibility, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Human Capital
We employed 138 full-time employees as of December 31, 2022. None of our employees are represented by a competitive bargaining unit, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. As of December 31, 2022, 56% of RPT's workforce were female. We believe our employees are key to achieving our business objectives and our corporate purpose of Turning Commercial Ground into Common Ground.
The Company is committed to continually building upon a culture that promotes empowerment, transparency and excellence and we strive to make the Company a safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. We appreciate the importance of having a diverse and inclusive workforce and are committed to integrating diversity and inclusion practices and initiatives into all aspects of our business and culture. As a demonstration of our commitment to maintaining an inclusive and safe work environment, all of our employees are required to comply with and complete training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that governs the standard for appropriate behaviors as well as complete discrimination, harassment, and retaliation prevention training.
To facilitate the attraction, retention, and promotion of a talented and diverse workforce, we provide competitive compensation, best in class benefits and health and wellness programs, training and professional development programs and champion programs that build connections between our employees and the communities where they live and at the properties we own.
Our comprehensive benefits package offers flexible and convenient health and wellness options such as health insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, parental leave, and family care resources. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our associates by encouraging work-life balance by offering a hybrid work schedule and generous time off policies. We also sponsor comprehensive wellness activities that include educational programs and corporate challenges, whereby employees are encouraged to incorporate healthy habits into their daily routines. In order to promote transparency and employee engagement, we distribute employee surveys to gauge employee satisfaction on a variety of issues. We hold company-wide town halls and meetings to update employees on business practices and corporate goals. Additionally, RPT supports philanthropical initiatives and partners with organizations that are committed to improving the overall quality of life in our communities. We support various organizations annually through charitable giving and hands on volunteerism through our “Act Locally Give Globally” program. We also provide competitive compensation packages to our employees. In addition to base salaries, these packages include annual bonuses, stock awards and participation in a 401(k) Plan. 
Competition
We compete with many other entities for the acquisition of shopping centers and land suitable for new developments, including other REITs, private institutional investors and other owner-operators of shopping centers.  In particular, larger REITs may enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital.  These competitors may increase the market prices we would have to pay in order to acquire properties.  If we are unable to acquire properties that meet our criteria at prices we deem reasonable, our ability to grow will be adversely affected.
Our tenants compete with alternate forms of retailing, including on-line shopping, home shopping networks and mail order catalogs.  Alternate forms of retailing may reduce the demand for space in our shopping centers. We indirectly share exposure to these same competitive factors because our ability to generate revenue may be connected to the success of our tenants.
Further, our shopping centers generally compete for tenants with similar properties located in the same neighborhood, community or region.  Although we believe we own high quality centers in desirable geographic locations, competing centers may be newer, better located or have a better tenant mix.  We also believe we compete with other centers on the basis of rental rates and management and operational expertise. In addition, new centers or retail stores may be developed, increasing the supply of retail space competing with our centers or taking retail sales from our tenants.  To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly to enable us to compete effectively. 
Governmental Regulation
Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property. In addition to the discussion below regarding certain environmental matters, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances disposed, stored, released, generated, manufactured or discharged from, on, at, onto, under or in such property. Environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substance.
We are not aware of any contamination which may have been caused by us or any of our tenants that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. As part of our risk management activities, we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs, the purpose of which is to expedite and facilitate satisfactory compliance with environmental laws and regulations should contaminants need to be remediated. We also have an environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs. While we believe that we do not have any material exposure to environmental remediation costs, we cannot give assurance that changes in the law or new discoveries of contamination will not result in additional liabilities to us.
Supplemental Tax Disclosure
The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus, dated February 18, 2022, contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333- 262871) filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022. Capitalized terms herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning as when used in such disclosures (as supplemented).
On December 29, 2022, the IRS promulgated final Treasury Regulations under Sections 897, 1441, 1445, and 1446 of the Code that were, in part, intended to coordinate various withholding regimes for non-U.S. stockholders. The new Treasury Regulations provide that: 
(i)The withholding rules applicable to ordinary REIT dividends paid to a non-U.S. stockholder (generally, a 30% rate of withholding on gross amounts unless otherwise reduced by treaty or effectively connected with such non-U.S. stockholder’s trade or business within the U.S. and proper certifications are provided) will apply to (a) that portion of any distribution paid by us that is not designated as a capital gain dividend, a return of basis or a distribution in excess of the non-U.S. stockholder’s adjusted basis in its stock that is treated as gain from the disposition of such stock and (b) any portion of a capital gain dividend paid by us that is not treated as gain attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest by reason of the recipient not owning more than 10% of a class of our stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market during the one-year period ending on the date of the capital gain dividend.
(ii)The withholding rules under FIRPTA will apply to a distribution paid by us in excess of a non-U.S. stockholder’s adjusted basis in our stock, unless the interest in our stock is not a U.S. real property interest (for example, because we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity) or the distribution is paid to a “withholding qualified holder.” A “withholding qualified holder” means a qualified holder (as defined below) and a foreign partnership all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships.
(iii)The withholding rules under FIRPTA will apply to any portion of a capital gain dividend paid to a non-U.S. stockholder that is attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest, unless it is paid to a withholding qualified holder.
In the case of FIRPTA withholding under clause (ii) above, the applicable withholding rate is currently 15%, and in the case of FIRPTA withholding under clause (iii) above the withholding rate is currently 21%. For purposes of FIRPTA withholding under clause (iii), whether a capital gain dividend is attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest is determined taking into account the general exception from FIRPTA distribution treatment for distributions paid to certain non-U.S. stockholders under which any distribution by us to a non-U.S. stockholder with respect to any class of stock which is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States is not treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if such non-U.S. stockholder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the 1-year period ending on the date of such distribution. To the extent inconsistent, these Treasury Regulations supersede the discussion on withholding contained in the above-referenced disclosures (as supplemented) under the heading “Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders.” However, if, notwithstanding these Treasury Regulations, we encounter difficulties in properly characterizing a distribution for purposes of the withholding rules, we may decide to withhold on such distribution at the highest possible U.S. federal withholding rate that we determine could apply.
New Treasury Regulations also provide new guidance regarding qualified foreign pension funds. Accordingly, the discussion contained in the paragraph under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders—Qualified Foreign Pension Funds” is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:
Qualified Foreign Pension Funds. In general, for FIRPTA purposes, and subject to the discussion below regarding “qualified holders,” neither a “qualified foreign pension fund” (as defined below) nor any entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund is treated as a foreign person, thereby exempting such entities from tax under FIRPTA. A “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established by a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions thereof) or one or more employers to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees as a result of, or in consideration for, services rendered, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. Under Treasury Regulations, subject to the discussion below regarding “qualified holders,” a “qualified controlled entity” also is not generally treated as a foreign person for purposes of FIRPTA. A qualified controlled entity generally includes a trust or corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country all of the interests of which are held by one or more qualified foreign pension funds either directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities.
Treasury Regulations further require that a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity will not be exempt from FIRPTA with respect to dispositions of U.S. real property interests or REIT distributions attributable to the same unless the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a “qualified holder.” To be a qualified holder, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity must satisfy one of two alternative tests at the time of the disposition of the U.S. real property interest or the REIT distribution. Under the first test, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder if it owned no U.S. real property interests as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition or distribution during which it qualified as a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity. Alternatively, if a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity held U.S. real property interests as of the earliest date during the period described in the preceding sentence, it can be a qualified holder only if it satisfies certain testing period requirements.
Treasury Regulations also provide that a foreign partnership all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships, may certify its status as such and will not be treated as a foreign person for purposes of withholding under Code Section 1445 (and Code Section 1446, as applicable).
