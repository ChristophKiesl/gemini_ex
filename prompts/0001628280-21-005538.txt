Overview
Data is foundational to our customers' digital transformation and we are focused on delivering innovative and disruptive technology and data storage solutions that enable customers to maximize the value of their data. In our first decade, we completely changed customers' expectations of what they should see from storage arrays and storage vendors, making flash storage widely available to enterprise organizations and revolutionizing the customer experience with our Evergreen Storage subscription model that radically simplified and reduced total cost of storage ownership. Today, we are changing the expectations for data and storage management by providing customers a cloud experience with flexible on-demand data services consumption through delivery of a Modern Data Experience that empowers organizations to run their operations as a true, automated, storage as-a-service model seamlessly across multiple clouds.
Our solutions support a wide range of structured and unstructured data, at scale and across any data workloads on-premise, in the cloud, or hybrid environments, and include mission-critical production, test/development, analytics, disaster recovery, and backup/recovery.
Our Modern Data Experience vision begins with our portfolio of products and subscription services that is transforming and modernizing storage operations for our customers. Our Modern Data Experience vision extends to an innovative and highly-integrated data platform of products and subscription services, consisting of Cloud Data Infrastructure (integrated hardware and software appliances which run in on-premise data centers), Cloud Data Services (software services which run natively in major public cloud infrastructures), and Cloud Data Management (software hosted data management services to manage our entire platform). The Modern Data Experience is based on four key pillars: Fast Matters, Cloud Everywhere, Simple is Smart, and Subscription to Innovation.
Fast Matters - Speed is critical to customer experience and engagement, and therefore, we design our high-performance solutions to allow applications, analytics, and development to move and execute quickly in order for our customers to make impactful decisions. We redefine fast by delivering low-latency, high bandwidth, and maximum density technologies. For example, accelerating core applications enables rapid response and deployment which reduces costs while increasing enterprise resilience.
Cloud Everywhere - Providing our customers the opportunity to transform their data management to a full or hybrid cloud model. This model reduces costs and adds agility through an API-defined platform, a consistent on-premise and public cloud experience, seamless data mobility and comprehensive data protection. This multi-cloud environment delivers increased flexibility, fast global recovery, and minimized application downtime through automated response.
Simple is Smart - From day one, our storage solutions are designed to be simple, allowing our customers to reduce time spent managing the storage platform including issue resolution. Our storage dashboards present real-time and intuitive platform analytics; meanwhile, AI-based optimization proactively analyzes future workloads and global network issues to limit unforeseen infrastructure problems.
Subscription to Innovation - Delivering a subscription with low total cost of ownership, eliminating the need for forklift hardware replacements, and providing customizable capacity and mobility, whether on-premise, in the cloud or hybrid cloud.
Portworx Acquisition
In October 2020, we expanded our data services capabilities for containerized, cloud-native applications with the acquisition of Portworx Inc. (Portworx), a privately-held container storage company that provides a Kubernetes data services platform. Cloud-native databases, analytics applications and artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks, such as Cassandra, MongoDB, Postgres, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Spark, and Tensorflow, are the tools upon which customers build their modern data pipelines. By integrating Portworx container data services, which includes storage, data protection, data security and disaster recovery/backup, with our data platforms, this acquisition further enhances our Modern Data Experience by expanding our support for these cloud-native applications on any infrastructure, on-premise or in the cloud environment at any scale.

•Global sales and distribution capability, including an ability to build and maintain senior customer relationships;
•Ability to take advantage of improvements in industry standard components; and
•Customer support and service.
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on these factors as a result of our hardware and software, product capabilities, ability to deliver the benefits of all-flash storage to a broad set of customers, management simplicity, ease of use and differentiated customer support. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights.
We have over 2,000 issued patents and patent applications in the United States and foreign countries. We also license technology from third parties when we believe it will facilitate our product offerings or business. 
Human Capital Resources
Our Chief People Officer (CPO) leads our human capital initiatives which includes the design and execution of all people strategy components. The CPO delivers human capital reports to the board of directors and compensation committee on a quarterly basis.
This past year we saw the evolution and pivot of our business strategy to cloud and data services which tested our organization’s agility and overall effectiveness. This inflection point served as a springboard to drive additional improvements across our business, including as it relates to our people strategy.
Our workforce is distributed over 39 countries, with 3,800 employees globally - almost 2,800 in the U.S. and over 1,000 internationally. We mobilize and engage our teams to support our cloud and data services strategy using the following objectives and measures.
Overall Employee Satisfaction 
To ensure employee engagement and satisfaction, we assess employees twice a year through our Employee Voice Survey program. We focus on measuring employee engagement, manager effectiveness, inclusion and belonging, and operational excellence. Also, as a result of COVID-19, we added five additional touchpoints to understand how our employees were coping, specifically measuring resilience and overall well-being. Our employee net promoter score (eNPS) score has been consistently high since we started this survey a few years ago. 
Response to COVID-19 Pandemic 
In January 2020, our CPO brought together leaders from across the business to form a cross-functional rapid response team (Tiger Team) to address COVID-19. This COVID-19 Tiger Team continues to meet several times weekly focused on providing accurate guidance, policies and programs to support our employees around the world. Here are last year's highlights:
•Work-from-home: To support the transition to working from home, we provided work-from-home stipends to build out home offices with ergonomic equipment.
•Benefits: We customized our benefit offerings to lean into programs focused on managing stress and mental health. All employees have virtual mental health and coaching sessions easily accessible to them and U.S. employees have 24/7 access to a virtual care team through a vendor which focuses on delivering COVID-19 testing, counseling, and family support. We also refreshed our death and permanent disability insurance to provide world-class coverage during the pandemic.
•Parents: We held several parent panels across our global regions designed to offer support and best practices to our community of parents. We also offered free resources, giving parents with children of any age, access to learning materials, webinars, and one-on-one coaching sessions. 
•Essential worker safety: We launched the Return to Office Playbook that outlines new safety and health protocols to keep essential workers safe in our offices. The playbook also outlines protocols in the event of a COVID-19 exposure to ensure an accurate chain of communications and next steps are taken in that specific office/region.
•Workforce of the future: Looking to a post-COVID world, we will shift to a hybrid workforce where offices will offer more collaborative spaces and working from home will become part of the regular week.
Culture of Excellence, Accountability, and Learning
Our company goals and leadership attributes set the tone for our culture of excellence and accountability. Through our Speak Up Policy, Code of Conduct, and Culture of Compliance survey, employees are empowered to use their voice and be transparent without fear of retaliation. In recognition, we garnered several accolades this year: Fortune Best Workplaces in Technology™ 2020, Fortune Best Workplaces in the Bay Area™ 2020, and Fortune Best Workplaces for Parents. 
In the past year, the Pure Learning and Development team has redesigned all of their program offerings to an entirely virtual delivery model, while also creating new programs like Manager Essentials and Leading at Pure, which focus entirely on building our leaders of tomorrow. 
Growing, Retaining and Attracting Talent
Our talent is our greatest asset. We are actively growing our employees from a skills and leadership perspective while also retaining our top performers and diverse talent. Our annual performance program brings feedback and rewards together to help facilitate an ongoing conversation between managers and employees on progress, goals, and expectations. We remain committed to our diverse hiring and sourcing practices to achieve healthy representation in candidate slates and interviewer panels while also bringing rigor and accountability to evaluating and hiring our talent.
Diversity, Inclusion, Belonging (DIBs)
We hired our first Head of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging in 2020 to further invest in our equity efforts. Our employee DIBs index last year, based on an internal employee survey, was high, reflecting the positive impact of our inclusivity efforts to date. We also have seven Employee Resource Groups that meet monthly and continue to be the fabric of our culture.
Total Rewards
We provide competitive and fair compensation and innovative benefit offerings. We regularly benchmark our programs against the market to ensure we are delivering competitive salaries, variable pay, equity awards as well as health and welfare benefits to employees. We conduct internal pay equity analyses to ensure appropriate pay is provided to everyone. We offer a comprehensive and tailored set of benefits to employees and their families including wellness programs and parental and adoption leave.
