Current Operations
 Overview
 The Company was incorporated for the purpose of engaging in mineral exploration and development activities. On August 28, 2017, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement (the Agreement) for the lease and option to purchase of the Bunker Hill Mine (the Mine) in Idaho. The Bunker Hill Lease with Option to Purchase is between the Company and Placer Mining Corporation (Placer Mining), the current owner of the Mine.
 Highlights of the Agreement are as follows:
 *
 Effective date: November 1, 2017;
 *
 Initial term: 24 months;
 *
 The lease can be extended for another 12 months at any time by the Company by paying Placer Mining a US $600,000 bonus payment and by continuing to pay the monthly lease payments of US $100,000 per month;
 *
 US $1 million bonus payment to Placer Mining no later than October 31, 2017;
 *
 The Company shall pay Placer Mining US $100,000 upon signing the lease and US $100,000 on October 1, 2017 for maintenance and upkeep fee of the mine;
 *
 The Company shall pay Placer Mining a US $500,000 bonus payment on November 15, 2017 and a US $500,000 bonus payment on December 15, 2017;
 *
 The Company shall pay Placer Mining US $100,000 monthly mining lease payments, which shall be paid quarterly (except for the lease payments for the months of November and December 2017, which shall be paid on or before November 1, 2017);
 *
 The option to purchase is exercisable at the Companys discretion; and
 *
 Purchase by the Company can be made at any time during lease period and any extension thereto.
 Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will have the right to purchase the Mine at any time before the end of the lease and any extension thereto for a purchase price of US $45 million with purchase payments to be made over a ten-year period to Placer Mining. Under the terms of the Agreement, there is a 3% NSR on production during the Lease and a 1.5% NSR on the production after the purchase option is exercised, which post-acquisition NSR is capped at US $60 million.
 Management believes this lease and option will provide the Company time to both produce a mine plan and raise the money needed to move forward and that this is a strong signal to the market that the Bunker Hill Mine is back. Management is now able to push forward and advance the time line to realizing shareholder value.

The Bunker Hill Mine was the largest producing mine in the Coeur d'Alene zinc, lead and silver mining district in northern Idaho.  Historically, the mine produced over 35M tonnes of ore grading on average 8.76% lead, 3.67% zinc, and 155 g/t silver (Bunker Hill Mines Annual Report 1980). 
 The Company believes that there are numerous targets of opportunity left in the mine from top to bottom, and particularly on strike to the west where more recent past drilling has resulted in major discoveries such as the Quill body of mineralized material.
 The Bunker Hill Mine is now the Companys only focus, with a view to raising capital to rehabilitate the mine and put it back into production.
 The Company was previously focused on exploring and developing the Trinity Silver property located in Pershing County, Nevada (the Trinity Project). The Trinity Project consists of a total of approximately 10,020 acres, including 5,676 acres of fee land and 253 unpatented mining claims located along the west flank of the Trinity Range in Pershing County, Nevada, about 25 miles by road northwest of Lovelock, NV, the county seat. The annual cost to maintain the 253 claims is approximately $35,420 per year ($140 per claim per year). In 2016, due to the lack of funding available to the Company, exploration progress was not on schedule with the Companys exploration and evaluation plan and, as a result of these circumstances, the related carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. The Company therefore recorded an impairment charge related to the Trinity Project and reduced its carrying amount of the Trinity Project to $1 on the balance sheet for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. 
 The Company did not commence development stage activities, but with adequate resources previous Management intended on: (i) expanding the known mineralized material through drilling, (ii) permitting for operation, if deemed economically viable, (iii) conducting metallurgical studies aimed at enhancing the recovery of the silver and by-product lead and zinc, and (iv) prepare an engineering design related to potential construction of a new mine. Exploration of the property would be conducted simultaneously with the mine development in order to locate additional mineralized materials.
 With the Companys Management focused on the Bunker Hill Mine, in September 2017, the Company agreed to relinquish its rights to the Trinity Project to Renaissance Exploration, Inc., its project partner, in return for releasing the Company from all past and future obligations.
 Products
 The Bunker Hill Mine is a Zinc-Silver-Lead Mine. When back in production, the Company will mill mineralized material on-site or at a local third-party mill and plans to produce concentrates to be shipped to third party smelters for processing.
 The Company will continue to explore the property with a view to proving resources.
 Infrastructure
 The acquisition of the Bunker Hill mine includes all mining rights and claims, surface rights, fee parcels, mineral interests, easements, existing infrastructure at Milo Gulch, and the majority of machinery and buildings at the Kellogg Tunnel portal level, as well as all equipment and infrastructure anywhere underground at the Bunker Hill Mine Complex. The acquisition also includes all current and historic data relating to the Bunker Hill Mine Complex, such as drill logs, reports, maps, and similar information located at the mine site or any other location. 
Government Regulation and Approval
 The current exploration activities and any future mining operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, waste disposal, worker safety, mine construction, and protection of endangered and protected species. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could have an adverse impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.

It is anticipated that it may be necessary to obtain the following environmental permits or approved plans prior to commencement of mine operations: 
 §
 Reclamation and Closure Plan
 §
 Water Discharge Permit 
 §
 Air Quality Operating Permit
 §
 Industrial Artificial (tailings) pond permit
 §
 Obtaining Water Rights for Operations
 Property Description
 The Companys agreement with Placer Mining Corporation includes mineral rights to 434 patented mining claims covering 5769.467 acres of those 35 include surface ownership over approximately 259.1 acres. The transaction also includes certain parcels of fee property which includes mineral and surface rights but are not patented mining claims. Mining claims and fee properties are located in Townships 47, 48 North, Range 2 East, Townships 47, 48 North, Range 3 East, Boise Meridian, Shoshone County, Idaho. 
 Surface rights were originally owned by various previous owners of the claims until the acquisition of the properties by BLP. BLP sold off surface rights to various parties over the years while maintaining access to conduct mining operations and exploration activities as well as easements to a cross over and access other of its properties containing mineral rights. Said rights were reserved to its assigns and successors in continuous perpetuity. Idaho Law also allows mineral right holders access to mine and explore for minerals on properties to which they hold minerals rights.
 Title to all patented mining claims included in the transaction was transferred from Bunker Hill Mining Co. (U.S.) Inc. by Warranty Deed in 1992. The sale of the property was properly approved of by the U.S. Trustee and U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
 Over 90% of surface ownership of patented mining claims not owned by Placer Mining Corp. is owned by different landowners. These include: Stimpson Lumber Co.; Riley Creek Lumber Co.; Powder LLC.; Golf LLC.; C & E Tree Farms; and Northern Lands LLC. 
 Patented mining claims in the State of Idaho do not require permits for mining activities to commence. The water discharge is being handled by the EPA at the existing water treatment plant. The Company will take on the water treatment responsibility and the Federal water discharge permit comes along with the water treatment plant.
 Competition
 The Company competes with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition of mining claims and leases on zinc and other base and precious metals prospects as well as in connection with the recruitment and retention of qualified employees. Many of these companies are much larger than the Company, have greater financial resources and have been in the mining business for much longer than it has. As such, these competitors may be in a better position through size, finances and experience to acquire suitable exploration and development properties. The Company may not be able to compete against these companies in acquiring new properties and/or qualified people to work on its current project, or any other properties that may be acquired in the future. 
 Given the size of the world market for base precious metals such as silver, lead and zinc, relative to the number of individual producers and consumers, it is believed that no single company has sufficient market influence to significantly affect the price or supply of these metals in the world market. 
 Employees
 The Company is currently managed by Bruce Reid, President and CEO; Julio DiGirolamo, Chief Financial Officer; and Howard Crosby, Executive Vice President.
