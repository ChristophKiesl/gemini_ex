ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Lee Enterprises, Incorporated is a leading provider of high quality, trusted, local news and information, and a major platform for advertising in the markets we serve. We are located primarily in the Midwest, Mountain West and West regions of the United States, and our 50 markets (including TNI Partners ("TNI") and Madison Newspapers, Inc. ("MNI")), across 22 states are principally mid-sized or small. Our printed newspapers reach more than 800,000 households daily and more than 1.2 million on Sunday, with estimated readership totaling three million. Our web and mobile sites are the number one digital source of local news in most of our markets, reaching more than 25 million unique visitors each month.
Our products include:

• | 47 daily and 34 Sunday newspapers; all with related digital operations; and


• | Nearly 300 weekly newspapers and classified and niche publications, most with related digital operations.

We also operate TownNews.com, through our 82.5% owned subsidiary INN Partners, L.C. ("TownNews.com"). TownNews.com provides digital infrastructure and digital publishing services for nearly 1,600 daily and weekly newspapers as well as universities, television stations, niche publications, and Lee Enterprises properties.

Our markets have established retail bases. Most are regional shopping hubs, and we are located in four state capitals. Six of our top ten markets, by revenue, include major universities, and seven are home to major corporate headquarters. We believe that operating the dominate provider of local news, information and advertising in these markets - combined with our ability to distribute our content across print and digital platforms - enables us to better execute our strategy. 
We generate revenue primarily through print and digital advertising, subscriptions to our publications and digital services, primarily through TownNews.com. Our operations also provide commercial printing, distribution of third party publications and marketing services. 
Advertising and marketing services - Approximately 58% of our 2017 revenue was derived from advertising and marketing services. We provide advertising and marketing solutions using a multi-platform sales approach that maximizes audience reach for our customers by offering multiple print and digital advertising platforms and products including: print and digital display advertising, desktop, mobile, tablet and other specialty print products. 
The following broadly define major categories of advertising and marketing services revenue: 

Retail advertising is print or digital revenue earned from sales of display advertising in the publication, or from preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, from local, regional and national businesses with local retail operations. 
Classified advertising is revenue from the sale of advertising space, or from separate publications, consisting primarily of advertising categories, such as employment, automotive, real estate, legal notices, obituaries and other merchandise. Classified publications offer advertisers a cost-effective, local advertising vehicle and can be particularly effective in larger markets with higher media fragmentation. 

National advertising is revenue earned from the sale of print or digital display advertising space, or from preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, from national accounts that do not have a local retailer representing the account in the market. 

Digital advertising consists of display, banner, behavioral targeting, search, rich media, directories, classified or other advertising on websites or mobile applications that are integrated with our print publications, or on third party websites accessed through the extended audience network. Digital advertising is reported in combination with print advertising in the retail, classified and national categories.
Niche publications are specialty publications, such as lifestyle, business, health or home improvement publications that contain advertising.

Marketing services is comprised of a suite of custom digital marketing services that include: Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Management, web and mobile production, social media services and reputation monitoring and management. Our marketing services also include media buying in audience extension networks (outside of those owned and operated by the Company) such as Centro DSP, Google Ad Exchange and Facebook.
The advertising environment is influenced by the state of the overall economy, including consumer confidence, retail sales, unemployment rates, inflation, energy prices and consumer interest rates. Our enterprises are primarily located in midsize and small markets. Historically our markets have been more stable than major metropolitan markets because our focus is on local, rather than national, advertising. More than eighty percent of our advertising revenue is derived from local and regional businesses. We believe that local advertising tends to be less sensitive to economic cycles than national advertising because local businesses generally have fewer effective advertising channels through which they may reach their customers.
Subscription - Approximately 34% of our 2017 revenue was derived from subscriptions to our printed and digital products. Subscription revenue is earned primarily from our full access subscription model, which provides subscribers print and digital access to our leading local news, information and advertising content for one price. Digital only options are also available to subscribers. 
Our operating costs are primarily compensation, newsprint and delivery. Over the past several years we have adjusted our business model to create operational efficiencies and significantly reduce our cost structure. 
2

We have centralized or regionalized most back office functions including the design of our newspapers. The centralized design centers have enabled us to more cost effectively design and layout the newspaper. The centralized design centers - combined with a common content management system across all of our daily newspaper markets - has created additional operating efficiencies and cost savings. We have templated designs for our printed and digital editions, and we have created a national news desk that shares high quality content across all of our markets, including national news, regional news and other special sections content. We believe we will continue to create additional operational efficiencies and continue to transform our business model.
Several of our businesses operate in geographic groups of publications, or “clusters,” which provide operational efficiencies, extend sales penetration and provide broader audiences for advertisers through consolidation of sales forces and back office management of operations such as: finance, human resources, subscription management, and the production of the publications. A table under the caption “Daily Newspapers and Markets” in Item 1, included herein, identifies those groups of our newspapers operating in clusters. 

We do not face significant daily print competition; however, our newspapers, classified and specialty publications, and digital products do compete with other forms of traditional media including: newspapers having national or regional distribution, magazines, radio, cable and satellite television, outdoor media, other classified and specialty publications, direct mail, directories, and national, regional and local advertising websites and content providers. Competition for advertising is based on audience size and composition, subscription levels, readership demographics, distribution and display mechanisms, price and advertiser results. We believe we capture a substantial share of the total advertising dollars spent in each of our markets. We also compete for circulation and readership against other news and information outlets.
The number of competitors in any given market varies, however all of the forms of competition noted above exist to some degree in our markets, including those listed in the table under the caption “Daily Newspapers and Markets” in Item 1, included herein. 
Lee Enterprises, Incorporated was founded in 1890, incorporated in 1950, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1978. 
We experienced significant net losses in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013 primarily due to non-cash charges for impairment of intangible and other assets and reorganization costs, and as a result, we have negative equity of $91.2 million. Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to repay, refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due, and remain in compliance with debt covenants. We are in compliance with our debt covenants at September 24, 2017. The information included herein should be evaluated in that context. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for additional information. 
STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
We are focused on several strategic initiatives:
Comprehensive Local News That Drives Frequency And Engagement
We drive frequency and engagement with our products by delivering valuable, intensely local, original news and information that in many cases, we believe, our audiences cannot otherwise readily obtain. Our large and talented news and editorial staff provide constant, real-time local news with significant breadth, depth and reliability. Our full access platform provides our subscribers with breaking news throughout the day on our digital platforms as well as in depth daily print and digital news and information.
We believe the strength of our local brands is the result of the quality and size of our news gathering staff. This allows us to provide the most comprehensive coverage of local news in our markets. In most of our markets, we are the leading source of print and digital news and information. As the consumption of news on digital devices has expanded, we have moved quickly to develop applications that address audience and digital advertising demands for mobile and tablet advertising platforms. As new digital technologies emerge, we expect to move rapidly to make our content available through them and monetize the audience accessing our content. 
We are focused on continually improving the functionality and design of all our news platforms, providing greater depth of coverage and increasing reader engagement. We are providing our journalists with tools to give them real-time 
3

information about audience engagement on our digital platforms. This helps inform their decisions on both presentation and coverage. 
We believe our journalists are at the forefront of gathering and producing news and information about their local community. We seek to grow our digital audience by engaging our readers with news and information that we believe stirs public awareness, advances ideas, inspires vision, creates debate and provokes action. Through our news leadership we strive to contribute to community betterment, promote education, foster commerce and help improve the quality of life in our markets. 
Accelerate And Expand Digital Revenue Growth
Our digital businesses have experienced rapid growth since 2010. Digital advertising grew 8.0% and reached 28.0% of total advertising and marketing services revenue for the year ending September 24, 2017. We are growing digital revenue by offering an expansive array of digital products including video: behavioral targeting, audience retargeting, banner ads, social networking, and digital couponing. 
We provide digital marketing services to small and midsized businesses ("SMBs"), including search engine marketing ("SEM"), social media, audience extension, business profiles, and website hosting and design. Amplified Local ("Amplified Local"), our marketing business aimed at the smaller SMBs, offers small business solutions including: search engine optimization (“SEO”), local online marketing, social media marketing, video advertising and web site design. Amplified Local seeks to help small businesses maximize the return on marketing dollars by increasing audience reach, expanding brands, and enhancing their web presence. We believe that these innovative solutions will continue to drive meaningful new opportunities for us to grow our digital marketing revenue. We also continue to expand our array of digital products to address advertisers evolving needs, react to competition while seeking to increase our share of advertising and marketing services spending from existing customers . 
Digital national revenue grew 6.0% in 2017, driven by our sweeps program and improved inventory management and pricing. Mobile advertising increased 2.0%, and digital retail advertising, which represents more than 60% of total digital advertising, increased 9.4% in 2017.
We believe TownNews.com represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue. In 2017, digital services revenue, which is primarily TownNews.com, totaled more than $14 million. Since 2011, the compounded annual growth rate of TownNews.com revenue has been 9%. 
We are a member of the Local Media Consortium (the “Consortium”). The Consortium partners with companies like Google, Yahoo! and other technology companies and service providers to increase the potential share of new revenue and audience-building programs available to consortium members, as well as improve the quality of information and advertising services available from, Consortium members. The Consortium currently includes more than 1,600 local newspapers and hundreds of local broadcast outlets in the United States.
In 2017, no single advertiser accounted for more than 3% of advertising revenue and our top 10 advertisers represented 9.4% of advertising revenue. 
Our local sales forces are one of our core strengths and are larger than any local competitor, and we believe they are the most highly trained and proficient sales force in our markets. We have strong relationships with businesses in our markets and offer a wide array of products to deliver the advertisers' message. Eighty percent of our advertising revenue now comes from local and regional businesses, and our sales executives pitch the power of our audiences directly to these local decision makers.
To address the evolving needs of local advertisers we changed the way we sell local advertising to maximize our opportunities with small and medium-sized businesses. Local, controllable advertising accounts - those in which our local sales teams have direct contact with the advertising decision makers - are the core of our business. To address the needs of and better serve these local advertisers we developed the Edison Project, which is directly aimed at these local advertisers.
With Edison, we completely restructured our local sales teams and simplified advertising packages, providing advertisers with an expanded robust digital presence, increased frequency in print products, and longer advertising commitments.

Our Big Pitch initiative targets larger, local accounts such as a large local hardware store or regional hospital group. We pair creative advertising campaigns with our broad suite of products, both digital and print. Because of the success of this program we've added creative resources and accelerated the number of pitches developed and made, providing greater creativity, faster speed to market, and more pitches closed.
In fiscal year 2017, we introduced Digital Connect, a digital services package aimed at growing digital revenue from local businesses. Digital Connect provides local businesses a turn-key package for expanding their digital presence through enhanced search engine management. Digital Connect has been the fastest growing digital category this fiscal year 2017 and is expected to be a significant contributor to our digital revenue growth in 2018.
Grow Audience Revenue And Engagement
Based on independent audience research conducted on our behalf, for the period January 2016 to January 2017, we reached 74% of all adults over the course of a seven-day period in 11 selected markets, which include most of our largest strategic business units. Forty six percent of the adults in these markets read our newspapers in print, with 19% being both newspaper readers and visitors to our digital platforms. Another 16% were digital users exclusively. The remaining 12%primarily used our newspapers to obtain advertising and other information. 
As media access and delivery vehicles continue to evolve, our audiences are evolving and increasingly moving from one delivery platform to another throughout the day and accessing our content in print, on desktops and laptops, and on mobile devices. We seek to grow our audience and engagement on whatever platform they choose by, among other things, continually improving content and presentation to maximize the unique and evolving capabilities of each platform. We have a large and growing digital audience for our products. Unique visitors to our digital sites averaged 25.3 million per month in 2017, while page views totaled 244.2 million per month in 2017. 
To serve our readers across all delivery platforms, we implemented a full access subscription model, which is now in place in substantially all of our markets. Full access provides subscribers complete access to our print and digital products available in their market for a single subscription rate. We also sell digital only subscriptions.
Transforming Our Business And Managing Our Costs
We are transforming our business model and reducing our costs to maintain our margins and operating cash flows. We have consolidated or regionalized many common functions; consolidated or selectively outsourced printing and ad production; discontinued unprofitable publications; reduced newsprint volume significantly; and continually seek to improve the efficiencies and reduce costs of our operation with additional consolidation and outsourcing. We have reduced personnel while protecting our strengths in news, sales and digital products. In 2017, on a same property basis we reduced cash costs(1) excluding workforce adjustments 7.7%. We continue to implement cost efficiencies while investing in revenue drivers. 
Generate Strong Adjusted EBITDA(1) With A Commitment To Reduce Our Debt
Throughout the last economic downturn and ongoing recovery - at a time of unprecedented transition for our industry - we have posted strong adjusted EBITDA and consistent margins. We anticipate modest capital expenditures and pension contributions, and we expect to continue to significantly reduce our debt each year. 
The principal amount of debt was reduced by $68.8 million in 2017 and totaled $548.4 million as of September 24, 2017. Since 2005, we have reduced debt by more than $1 billion and we expect to continue to significantly reduce our debt in 2018. As a result of our debt reductions, interest expense was reduced by $6.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016, providing additional free cash flow for debt service and other corporate uses such as the June 30, 2017 acquisition of the Dispatch-Argus serving Moline and Rock Island, IL ("Dispatch-Argus") for $7.2 million.

PULITZER 

In 2005, we acquired Pulitzer Inc. (“Pulitzer”). We currently publish 9 daily newspapers that were acquired from Pulitzer and more than 60 weekly newspapers and specialty publications. Pulitzer also includes our 50% interest in TNI, as discussed more fully below. 
Pulitzer newspapers largest operations include Bloomington, IL and St. Louis, Missouri, where its subsidiary, St. Louis Post-Dispatch LLC (“PD LLC”), publishes the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, our only major daily newspaper which serves the greater St. Louis metropolitan area. St. Louis newspaper operations also include a variety of specialty publications, and supports its related digital products as well as the Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, a group of weekly newspapers and niche publications that focus on separate communities within the metropolitan area. 

The 2005 acquisition was financed primarily with debt. The second lien term loan lenders have a first lien on Pulitzer assets. Excess cash flow from Pulitzer, as defined in the Second Lien Loan Agreement, and cash flow from Pulitzer asset sales are used to pay down the second lien term loan at par. On August 28, 2016 we sold substantially all of the assets of our Provo, Utah newspaper operations, a former Pulitzer newspaper, and proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the second lien term loan. 
TNI Partners 

In conjunction with the Pulitzer acquisition we obtained a 50% interest in TNI, the Tucson, Arizona newspaper partnership. TNI, acting as agent for our subsidiary, Star Publishing Company (“Star Publishing”) and Citizen Publishing Company (“Citizen”), the owner of the remaining 50%, a subsidiary of Gannett Co., Inc., (“Gannett”). TNI was responsible for printing, delivery, advertising and subscription activities of the Arizona Daily Star and the Tucson Citizen. In May 2009, Citizen discontinued print publication of the Tucson Citizen and in 2014 stopped publishing its digital product. 
TNI collects all receipts and income and pays substantially all operating expenses incident to the partnership's operations and publication of the newspaper and other media. Under the amended and restated operating agreement between Star Publishing and Citizen, the Arizona Daily Star remains the separate property of Star Publishing. Results of TNI are accounted for using the equity method. Income or loss of TNI (before income taxes) is allocated equally to Star Publishing and Citizen. TNI makes weekly distributions to Star Publishing and Citizen of all available cash.

The TNI agency agreement (“Agency Agreement”), has governed the operation since 1940. The Agency Agreement expires in 2040, but contains an option, which may be exercised by either party, to renew the agreement for successive periods of 25 years each. Star Publishing and Citizen also have a reciprocal right of first refusal to acquire the 50% interest in TNI owned by Citizen and Star Publishing, respectively, under certain circumstances. Both the Company and Citizen incur certain administrative costs and capital expenditures that are reported by their individual companies. 

MADISON NEWSPAPERS 

We own 50% of the capital stock of MNI and 8.7% of the common stock of The Capital Times Company (“TCT”). TCT owns 50% of the capital stock of MNI. MNI publishes daily and Sunday newspapers, and other publications in Madison, Wisconsin, and other Wisconsin locations, and supports their related digital products. MNI conducts business under the trade name Capital Newspapers. We have a contract to furnish the editorial and news content for the Wisconsin State Journal, which is published by MNI, and periodically provide other services to MNI for a fee. Results of MNI are accounted for using the equity method. Net income or loss of MNI (after income taxes) is allocated equally to the Company and TCT. MNI makes quarterly dividend payments to the Company and TCT.
AUDIENCES 

Based on independent research, we estimate that, in an average week, our newspapers and digital products reach approximately 74% of adults in our larger markets. We also measure use of our daily newspapers for advertising, sports scores and entertainment listings ("print users").

After advertising, subscriptions and single copy sales are our largest source of revenue. For the 13 weeks ended September 2017, our daily circulation units, which include TNI and MNI, as measured by the Alliance for Audited Media ("AAM") were 0.8 million and Sunday circulation units were 1.2 million.

Growth in audiences can, over time, also positively impact advertising revenue. Our strategies to grow audiences include continuous improvement of content and promotional efforts to expand our audience. Content can include focus on local news, features, scope of coverage, accuracy, presentation, writing style, tone and type style. Promotional efforts include advertising, contests and other initiatives to increase awareness of our products. Customer service can also influence print subscriptions. The continued improvement of mobile and tablet applications has positively impacted our digital audiences.

We have historically experienced higher retention of customers using credit cards or automatic bank account withdrawals, ("EZ pay") as the form of subscription payment. Accordingly we focus our enterprises on increasing the number of EZ pay subscribers. Other initiatives vary from location to location and are determined principally by our centralized consumer sales and marketing group in collaboration with local management. Competition for subscriptions is generally based on the content, journalistic quality and price of the publication. 

Audience competition exists in all markets, from unpaid print and digital products, but is most significant in markets with competing local daily newspapers. These markets tend to be near major metropolitan areas, where the size of the population may be sufficient to support more than one daily newspaper. 
Our subscription sales channels continue to evolve through an emphasis on targeted telemarketing, direct mail and email to acquire new subscribers and retain current subscribers.

NEWSPRINT 

The raw material of newspapers, and our other print publications, is newsprint. We purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. We believe we will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for our needs and consider our relationships with newsprint producers to be good. Newsprint purchase prices can be volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include foreign currency exchange rates and both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Price fluctuations can effect our results of operations. We have not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, included herein.
