Item 1. Business
Overview
New Relic delivers a software platform for customers to land all of their telemetry data quickly and affordably in one place and derive actionable insights from that data in a unified front-end application. This category of software products is generally referred to as observability. Our customers use the New Relic platform to observe and operate the components of their digital infrastructure and provide a quality digital experience for their customers. With a unified front end, purpose built on top of the world’s most powerful telemetry data platform, the New Relic platform helps our users get a comprehensive and consistent view of their digital estate. 
The New Relic platform is designed for all engineers, which fuels our growth strategy that is oriented towards the broader developer productivity market. At present, most observability software is targeted at a small subset of the developer community that works in the “operate” phase of the developer lifecycle. These engineers are primarily concerned with the availability of the applications and infrastructure that are the primary components of a customer’s digital environment. However, a key component of our multi-year strategy is to help all software developers realize the largely dormant value of telemetry data. We fundamentally believe that insights gained from telemetry data are valuable in all of the phases of the developer lifecycle: plan, build, deploy, and operate. 
To grow within the market, we employ a land-and-expand business model centered on growing our partnership with our customers as they realize incremental value from the New Relic platform. We drive product awareness, demand, adoption, and activation through self-service, product-led growth strategies. Once activated, customers may increase their consumption of the New Relic platform as they add more data, users, and use cases. For customers with enterprise scale deployment, we deploy sales-led growth strategies to nurture and ensure long-term customer success for larger customers.
We believe our platform is positioned as the only true observability platform, which is grounded in three strategic technological pillars: 
1.We serve all engineers: The New Relic platform is used not just by IT operations professionals but by a wide variety of engineers, including application developers, mobile developers, site reliability engineers (“SRE”), network engineers, and more. Our mission is to democratize observability and make observability a daily practice for all engineers at every stage of the software lifecycle, and the goal of our strategic product roadmap is to deliver products that support this mission at a sustained pace.
2.We support the entire software lifecycle: Our platform’s usage is not limited to troubleshooting applications in production environments. Engineers use the New Relic platform across production and pre-production environments to plan, build, and test software before it goes into production. Our ability to ship features and capabilities for the entire software lifecycle increases our platform’s engagement and separates our solutions from other tools that are focused solely on production troubleshooting. 
3.We deliver observability as a cohesive platform experience: We view the New Relic platform as a true observability platform and not a bundle of SKUs with disjointed experiences and disparate pricing models stitched into a user interface. The platform has the flexibility to ingest telemetry from any source and modality (metrics, events, logs, and traces) into a unified Telemetry Data Platform. Engineers act on the collected telemetry via a unified and AI-enabled user interface which converges all observability workflows into one cohesive experience.
These three strategic pillars are reinforced by our consumption-based pricing model which we introduced in 2020. We found pre-existing pricing models to have the unintended effect of limiting instrumentation and, ultimately, customer visibility into their system performance. With our consumption-based pricing model and simplified platform offering, we believe we have removed those barriers. 
To accelerate engagement, adoption, and consumption of our platform, we price based on consumption as measured by the number of provisioned users and the amount of data ingested into our system. We offer three paid plans—Standard, Pro and Enterprise—designed to meet the needs of our customers of all sizes and maturity levels. We also offer a perpetual free tier of the New Relic platform. As a result, our direct sales prospects are often familiar with our platform and may already be using it in a limited fashion. A core component of our growth strategy is to provide a friction-free environment for developers to 
familiarize themselves with our solutions, and then offer incremental opportunities to derive more value from our products either by in-product support, or engaging with our technically oriented customer adoption team.
By removing data silos and standardizing on a single observability platform, customers across the globe can more easily understand end-to-end system health and are better able to achieve business imperatives of speed of innovation, operational excellence, system reliability, and cost management. We believe our consumption-based pricing has changed the fundamental unit economics of the industry, and with it the nature of the relationship between us as the vendor and our customers. With consumption-based pricing, our success is directly tied to the value our products deliver to our customers. We believe that as we continue to build and deliver compelling experiences that help customers solve their daily problems, we will continue to attract new customers and our customers will increase the amount of data they send to us, as well as the number of users they have on our platform. 
Our customers span the continuum from startups to some of the world’s largest corporations; the common thread among all of the users of our products is a desire to offer their constituents a top-tier digital experience. We engage with prospects and customers directly through our field, inside sales teams and on our website, as well as indirectly through channel partners. The majority of our customers are on either “Pay as You Go” contracts where they are charged for usage in arrears, or commitment contracts where they commit to a minimum spend over their contracted period in exchange for a discount on their usage pricing. The majority of our commitment contracts are one year in duration and are invoiced upfront. When a customer’s data ingest or number of provisioned users exceeds their aggregate commitment, they are invoiced for incremental charges when their consumption exceeds their commitment at the rate they negotiated in the commitment. When we enter into multi-year commitment contracts, we typically invoice the customer on an annual basis.
We also generate revenue from services, which consist primarily of fees associated with consulting and training services. Revenue from services accounts for a de minimis amount of our total revenue. We expect to continue to invest in our product and go-to-market organizations as we believe both the self-serve nature of our products and the customer-specific attention from our technologists play an important role in accelerating our customers’ realization of the benefits of our platform, which helps drive customer retention and expansion.
Key Benefits to Our Customers
The New Relic platform provides the following key benefits: 
•Fuel innovation and growth. We empower engineers with data and visibility to support faster software delivery and more experimentation to increase customer satisfaction, revenue, and market share. Powered by the insights and visibility of the New Relic platform, our customers can reduce time to market by building and deploying software faster, improving development efficiency and improving alignment and collaboration across business and technical teams.
•Deliver exceptional customer experience. We enable engineers and organizations to deliver digital customer experiences that drive engagement, conversion, and brand affinity. With the New Relic platform, our customers can view what their own customers are actually experiencing on their digital platforms to avoid churn, lost revenue, and reputational harm. 
•Improve system performance. We help engineers proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact customers. With the New Relic platform, our customers have a common platform to adopt and implement DevOps and SRE principles so they can improve incident resolution times, reduce the number of customer-reported incidents, and reduce downtime of the systems they manage. 
•Drive operational efficiency. The New Relic platform helps engineering teams build for scale to realize the benefits of cloud investments and optimize resource consumption. Engineering teams leverage observability to improve the pace of cloud adoption, digital transformation, budget predictability, and overall employee productivity. 
Our Platform and Key Strengths
With the launch of the New Relic platform, we built upon the foundation of our application performance monitoring (“APM”) offering to deliver what we view as a true observability platform where enterprises large and small can unify all telemetry and observability workflows in a single platform. The motivation for this evolution was to align our roadmap and consumption-based business model to address the needs of our customers. Our vision is to empower all engineers at every phase of the software lifecycle to leverage the power of data-driven engineering, and the New Relic platform is designed to address a multitude of existing and emerging customer use cases:
1.Scalable data platform. Sitting at the core of the New Relic platform is our secure, hyper-scalable, cloud-based data platform which serves as the single source of truth for all operational data, providing users with the ability to ask and answer questions within milliseconds. Customers have the flexibility to rapidly ingest all telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces) at scale from any source, and analyze it all in one place. Once ingested, customers can query that data in milliseconds, build, customize and share dashboards, and create alerts based on signals that matter the most. 
2.Full-stack monitoring verticals. With all of a customer’s telemetry in one place, the New Relic platform provides end-to-end observability in one curated, connected platform to help users make sense of their data and take action on it. The New Relic platform connects and correlates data from across the full stack—from client-side, to the application, to the underlying infrastructure and network, all with logs and distributed traces in context—so users can analyze, debug, and troubleshoot their full stack in just a few clicks. We continue to launch new vertical monitoring experiences to address new use cases and personas. In fiscal 2022, we launched the following new platform verticals:
◦Pixie, which enhances our Kubernetes Monitoring solution and helps developers debug Kubernetes environments faster;
◦Network Performance Monitoring, which helps DevOps teams to better align with network engineers; and 
◦Model Performance Monitoring, which allows data scientists to optimize machine learning models. 
With the New Relic platform, customers no longer have to juggle siloed tools with varying and often confusing pricing metrics that have led to selective instrumentation, tool sprawl, and disconnected silos of critical operational data. Our unified, full-stack monitoring UIs give engineers the curated context they need to solve problems across their entire estate—all in one place.
3.Cross-platform observability experiences. Building on our massive and scalable data backend, we are able to solve new use cases for our customers beyond the problems that traditional monitoring solutions address. We have integrated AI and machine learning across the entire platform for AI-assisted incident response. Errors Inbox brings together error data from across the full stack so developers can detect, triage, and resolve errors faster, with persistent context. We are solving exciting new use cases for software developers in pre-production environments where solutions such as New Relic CodeStream and our partnerships with CI/CD vendors are helping developers leverage production telemetry to improve code builds and deploys.
The key strengths of the New Relic platform are: 
•End-to-End Observability. All telemetry data, regardless of its source (whether from proprietary or open source agents, APIs, or exporters) is aggregated in one place and available to query, alert, visualize, and navigate, with meaningful analytics powered by comprehensive AI and machine-learning capabilities. 
•Faster, Simpler Incident Response. With our AI-assisted incident response, customers can detect issues proactively, reduce alert noise, identify root causes, and take action using two-way integration with widely used incident management systems.
•Cloud Migration and Adoption. Through the strength of our platform and our strategic partnerships, we help engineers minimize cloud migration risk while accelerating migration timelines so they can observe systems, measure efficacy, and optimize costs before, during, and after a migration. 
•Dynamic and On-Demand Scalability. Our multi-tenant SaaS platform scales dynamically and on-demand to some of the largest environments without penalty or pre-reservation requirements. This means our customers can meet the demands of their peak business days with confidence. This dynamic scalability is available at a straightforward and predictable cost, regardless of the architecture or environment, and without punitive pricing for data granularity. 
•Spend Predictability, Transparency, and Flexibility. Our platform’s simplified consumption-based pricing model incentivizes users to instrument more of their services, applications, and hosts—and thereby get more value out of their observability platform—while also eliminating unforeseen fees and unpredictable overages. Customers now pay for the New Relic platform based on their actual consumption of the platform, not unlike how they pay for their cloud providers, and are able to obtain higher degrees of transparency, flexibility, and control. 
•Observability for All. Our mission is to democratize observability by making it a daily practice for all engineers. At the core of our philosophy is an obsession to help teams get past “what” happened and dig deeper to understand "why" their software and systems are behaving as they are. This is increasingly important given the complexity introduced by today’s modern architectures, multi-cloud environments, and distributed teams.
•Rapid Time to Value. We make it easy for all engineers to get started quickly with observability best practices. In fiscal 2022, we launched New Relic Instant Observability (New Relic I/O), an open source ecosystem of quickstarts that deliver pre-built integrations, dashboards, and alerts for over 450 technologies and frameworks. With New Relic I/O, engineers don’t need to spend hours manually setting up observability across the stack and can start getting insights in a single click.
•Open Source Commitment. New Relic is making it easier for everyone to instrument everything through our commitment to open standards, open source instrumentation, and the open communities that support them. We have standardized on OpenTelemetry for all collections and most of our agents are open source. We have joined the governing board of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and contributed Pixie, a Kubernetes-native in-cluster observability platform, as an open source project. We are also a founding member of Eclipse Adoptium, a leading provider of Java runtimes.
•Market Leadership. Innovation and disruption is in our DNA. We continue to disrupt the industry with our visionary approach to observability. We have been named a leader in the Gartner APM Magic Quadrant for nine consecutive years and in October 2020, we tied for the #1 rating in the Gartner Peer Insights APM “Voice of the Customer.” 
•Platform Extensibility. In addition to the UIs and workflows provided natively in the New Relic platform, customers can use the data they ingest into the platform to build custom applications that drive measurable value specific to their business. The New Relic platform supports custom app development via common open source frameworks, a library of existing applications, and a rich development environment.
•Enterprise-grade Security. We have developed robust security processes to help protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data so that users can control how their data is stored and used. We undergo annual audits by third-party services, our platform is HIPAA and SOC2 compliant, and we have achieved FedRAMP authorization at a moderate impact level.
Our Growth Strategies
We grow using a “land-and-expand” business model with two primary distribution channels, self-serve and sales-led growth. For customers from whom we generate trailing 12-month revenue below a certain threshold, self-serve tactics allow these customers to adopt platform features via marketing and product-driven sales. As a customer starts to exceed that threshold in trailing 12-month revenue, we typically transition the customer to a more traditional direct sales model, or sales-led growth. 
We intend to pursue the following growth initiatives: 
•Acquire new customers via self-serve initiatives: We believe we have the most competitive product in the industry. We intend to democratize access to it and drive significant awareness, adoption, and growth in new accounts by accelerating our self-service product marketing and sales efforts. 
•Expand consumption within our installed base: Our existing customer base across industry verticals and regions represents a sizable captive market to increase users and data by promoting increased platform engagement and addressing new use cases.
•Accelerate platform roadmap and ship innovation at high velocity: We have a proven track record of pioneering innovations in our industry. We intend to build on that reputation and accelerate our roadmap to broaden the platform capabilities and deepen its features so that more engineers can use New Relic and use it more often. 
•Expand our customer base globally through an increasing emphasis on alliances: Commercial partner alliances and expansion in international markets presents a significant opportunity to acquire new customers. We intend to increase our investment on both fronts as more businesses across the world accelerate their cloud native journey.
Operations
We host our applications and serve all our customers from data centers and a combination of cloud hosting providers. We utilize third parties to manage the infrastructure at our data centers. In addition, we are continuing to build out services and functionality in the public cloud with a view to migrating our entire platform to the public cloud over time. This strategy provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and scale our deployment capabilities. We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of our data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers. Our technology uses multi-tenant architecture, enabling all our customers to share the same version of our products and platform capabilities while securely partitioning their data.
Human Capital Management
As of March 31, 2022, we had a total of 2,217 employees, including temporary employees, operating across 15 countries, including 637 employees located outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. Employees in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements.
Culture and Engagement
Our “accountable, bold, authentic, passionate, and connected” core values inform and guide our human capital initiatives and objectives. We screen new hires and measure employee performance against these company values, and regularly measure employee engagement against these values through our surveys and all-hands meetings and AMA (“ask me anything”) sessions. We also use these surveys, meetings, and sessions to collect employee feedback and assess the effectiveness of our culture, our strategy, and various health and well-being programs. We believe our values-driven culture has contributed to our recognition as a great place to work by our employees. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We strive to build a diverse workforce, promote equity in our practices, and create inclusive communities for all our employees to thrive. Internally, we offer training for employees around unconscious bias, and other diversity and inclusion-related topics designed to create a culture of belonging. In addition, our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team works closely with division leaders to review current diversity and inclusion data, identify themes, and create action plans with measurable objectives and key results for their divisions, with the goal of increasing diversity and growing every employee’s sense of belonging.
We work hard to maintain and enhance our diverse and inclusive environment, creating a workplace where people are highly valued and are empowered to do their best work. Our employee resource groups offer our employees support, mentoring, and networking opportunities and help to foster a friendly and diverse workplace.
Compensation and Benefits
New Relic is committed to delivering a comprehensive compensation and benefits program that provides support for all of our employees’ well-being. We provide competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain talented employees, including offering market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants, as well as provide an employee stock purchase plan, to foster a strong sense of ownership and engage our employees in being committed to our long-term success. We ensure that our compensation is fair for all employees, regardless of classifications, such as race and gender. We routinely run a rigorous statistical analysis to ensure compensation is fair, taking into account factors that should impact pay, like role, level, location and performance.
Our full-time employees are eligible to receive, subject to the satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements, our comprehensive benefits package including our medical, dental, and vision insurance and life and disability insurance plans. In addition, we provide flexible time off, as well as maintain a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan that provides eligible U.S employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis, including providing a match for employee contributions. In structuring these benefit plans, we seek to provide an aggregate level of benefits that are comparable to those provided by similar companies. While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits vary regionally due to local regulations and preferences.
Training and Development
    Ensuring our employees have access to development opportunities and understand how to grow their career at New Relic is a critical part of our talent and engagement practices. As part of our efforts, we invest in a robust training portal for employees, complete with online courses and live training on a variety of topics. To recognize and promote outstanding employees, we perform a comprehensive annual talent review process, through which we empower employees to drive their professional development in a way that also aligns with company objectives and our company values.
COVID-19 Response
To support employee well-being, New Relic established a number of programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to a hybrid model where we allow employees an option to work from home full-time. Our top priority has been to ensure our employees have the resources they need to care for themselves and their families. We created 
flexible work schedule options, gave employees a home office stipend, and implemented for a period of time an unlimited time off code for caregiving or mental health responsibilities, provided additional mental health benefits, hosted learning events such as “Building Resilience” and “Parenting During COVID,” in addition to other various employee-led events such as meditations, workouts, experience sharing, and virtual performances.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of all aspects of the New Relic suite of products and platform capabilities. We invest heavily in these efforts to continuously improve, innovate, and add new features to our solutions.
We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies through daily and weekly software releases or updates in order to minimize disruption and provide for constant improvement. Our product managers regularly engage with customers, partners, and industry analysts, as well as other stakeholders, in functions such as sales, customer success, marketing, and business development to understand customer needs as well as general trends in our industry. Once product improvements are identified, the development organization works closely together to design, develop, test, and launch a solution.
As of March 31, 2022, we had 773 employees in our research and development organization. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive market awareness, create and manage user and customer leads, provide qualified leads to our sales pipeline, and build customer relationships to drive revenue growth. As of March 31, 2022, we had 860 employees in our sales and marketing organization.
Sales
Under our “land-and-expand” business model, our sales strategy is to rely on two primary distribution channels, self-serve and sales-led growth. For customers from whom we generate trailing 12-month revenue below a certain threshold, self-serve tactics allow these customers to adopt platform features via marketing and product-driven sales. As a customer starts to exceed that threshold in trailing 12-month revenue, we typically transition the customer to a more traditional direct sales model, or sales-led growth, under which our direct sales organization engages with our larger accounts. Our direct sales organization is organized by geography and size of customer and is focused on growing the number of accounts and usage within accounts (i.e., providing our customers with a broader set of our product solutions).
Marketing
Our marketing strategy focuses on meaningful interactions with practitioners and buyers by targeting software developers, operations professionals, IT leaders, and technology executives across many industries and regions. Additionally, our digital engagement strategy, demand generation, customer programs, events, corporate communications, and product marketing teams focus on building brand, engagement, and demand with our target markets. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online banner and video advertising, our website, product demonstrations and trials, blogs, corporate communications, whitepapers, case studies, user events, sponsorships, and webinars. We believe an effective method to market our platform is for users to actively use and explore its capabilities. We encourage free trials of one or more of our products in order to successfully convert those accounts to paid subscriptions.
Seasonality
We have experienced seasonality in our sales and operating results in the past, and will continue to experience seasonality in the future. Historically, we have received a higher volume of orders in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and to a lesser extent our third fiscal quarter of each year. As a result, we have historically seen higher cash collections in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year, and our sequential growth in remaining performance obligations has historically been highest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and to a lesser extent our third fiscal quarter of each year. With our shift to a consumption based pricing model, we expect over time that our revenue will more closely approximate our customer usage of our products and services, and thereby our revenue may experience seasonal fluctuations based upon our customer consumption patterns.
Customer Support
Our products and platform capabilities are designed to minimize the need for customer support, as users can easily download, install, and deploy agents and other technology to ingest data into our platform without needing support. We offer a range of customer support options with multiple levels of support. These include free community support, email support, and 
phone support, up to our customer support organization, which provides dedicated customer success representatives, onsite support, with global capabilities and is available at all hours of the day. Through our training platform, we offer courses to help our customers quickly learn how to effectively use our products as well as implement best practices. Courses are available online, in-person at events, and, as requested by certain customers, on-site. Our training sessions are typically targeted at specific levels of employee seniority and product experience, such as agent essentials or administrator experts, to more effectively tailor training to intended audiences.
Partnerships and Strategic Relationships
We have built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. We also have developed relationships with several cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and others, through which we collaborate to ensure our products and platform capabilities work well on applications running on their clouds. These providers offer access to our products and platform capabilities through links on their websites, refer developers and other potential users to us, and expand our marketing reach. Additionally, a growing number of system integrators, consultants, and value-added resellers are using the New Relic platform to help their customers make the resourcing and prioritization decisions necessary for successful cloud migrations and transformation projects.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Our unified observability platform combines functionality from numerous traditional product categories, and hence we compete in each of these categories with home-grown and open-source technologies, as well as a number of different commercial vendors.
With respect to application performance monitoring, we compete with providers such as Cisco Systems, Inc. and Dynatrace, Inc. With respect to log management, we compete with Elastic NV and Splunk Inc. With respect to infrastructure monitoring, we compete with diversified technology vendors such as International Business Machines Corporation, BMC Software, Inc. and CA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Broadcom, Inc.); with native solutions from cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Google LLC; and with independent vendors such as Datadog, Inc.
The principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product and platform features, architecture, reliability, security, performance, effectiveness, and supported environments;
•product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•digital operations expertise;
•ease of use of products and platform capabilities;
•price and total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•focus on customer success.
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law, and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our intellectual property. As of March 31, 2022, we had 40 issued patents in the United States and abroad, and 35 patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We are also the registered holder 
of a variety of United States and international domain names that include the term New Relic. Our products utilize our “New Relic” trademark as well as our logo and images.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
Companies in Internet-related industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
Government Regulation
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.
