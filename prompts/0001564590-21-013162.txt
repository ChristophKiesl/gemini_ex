Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a nationally recognized off-price retailer of high-quality, branded apparel at everyday low prices. We opened our first store in Burlington, New Jersey in 1972, selling primarily coats and outerwear. Since then, we have expanded our store base to 761 stores as of January 30, 2021, in 45 states and Puerto Rico. We have diversified our product categories by offering an extensive selection of in-season, fashion-focused merchandise at up to 60% off other retailers’ prices, including: women’s ready-to-wear apparel, menswear, youth apparel, baby, beauty, footwear, accessories, home, toys, gifts and coats. We sell a broad selection of desirable, first-quality, current-brand, labeled merchandise acquired directly from nationally recognized manufacturers and other suppliers.
 We continue to focus on a number of ongoing initiatives aimed at increasing our overall profitability by improving our comparable store sales trends, increasing total sales growth and reducing expenses. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, those discussed under “Ongoing Initiatives for Fiscal 2021” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 As used in this Annual Report, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Burlington Stores, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries.
 Fiscal Year End 
 We define our fiscal year as the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. This Annual Report covers the 52-week fiscal year ended January 30, 2021 (Fiscal 2020). The fiscal years ended February 1, 2020 (Fiscal 2019) and February 2, 2019 (Fiscal 2018) also consisted of 52 weeks.
 COVID-19
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (known as COVID-19) outbreak to be a global pandemic. As a result, we began the temporary closing of some of our stores, and effective March 22, 2020, we made the decision to temporarily close all of our stores, distribution centers (other than processing of received inventory) and corporate offices to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19. We began re-opening stores on May 11, 2020, with the majority of stores, as well as all distribution centers, re-opened by mid-June 2020, and substantially all stores re-opened by the end of the second quarter. We are currently unable to determine how long the conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue, including the imposition of social distancing protocols and other restrictions on our store operations, and whether potential subsequent additional outbreaks will lead to a reduction in customer traffic and additional temporary store closures.

These developments have caused significant disruptions to our business and have had a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The continuing extent of which will be primarily based on a variety of factors, including the production and administration of effective medical treatments and vaccines, the timing and extent of any recovery in traffic and consumer spending at our stores, supply chain delays due to closed factories or distribution centers, reduced workforces or labor shortages, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas, and any future required store closures because of COVID-19 resurgences.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the temporary closing of our stores, we provided two weeks of financial support to associates impacted by these store closures and by the shutdown of distribution centers. We temporarily furloughed most store and distribution center associates, as well as some corporate associates, but continued to provide benefits to furloughed associates in accordance with our benefit plans. In addition, we paid 100% of their medical benefit premiums during the period they were furloughed. During the second quarter, we recalled all furloughed associates at our re-opened stores, as well as our corporate and distribution facilities.
 In order to maintain financial flexibility during these uncertain times, we completed several debt transactions in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 and took certain other steps to further enhance our financial flexibility. See “Executive Summary” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
We continue to keep health and safety as a top priority as we operate our stores and distribution centers. We have implemented social distancing and safety practices, including:
  
• | Signage to remind customers and associates to practice social distancing and remain at least six feet apart
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | One way entrances and exits at the front of the store 


• | Wider check-out lanes, with social distancing markers on the floor 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
• | A physical barrier between customers and associates at each register


• | Closing all fitting rooms 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Routinely cleaning and disinfecting all areas of the store, including frequently cleaning high-touch areas


• | Providing sanitization materials throughout the store
--+------------------------------------------------------
• | Making shopping cart wipes available to customers 


• | Requiring associates to wear face coverings while in stores and our distribution centers 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Screening all associates daily in stores and distribution centers where required by state and local mandates

Our Stores 
 Over 99% of our net sales are derived from stores we operate as Burlington Stores. We believe that our customers are attracted to our stores principally by the availability of a large assortment of first-quality, current, brand-name merchandise at everyday low prices. 
 Burlington Stores offer customers a complete line of merchandise, including: women’s ready-to-wear apparel, accessories, footwear, menswear, youth apparel, baby, home, coats, beauty, toys and gifts. Our broad selection provides a wide range of apparel, accessories and furnishings for all ages. We purchase both pre-season and in-season merchandise, allowing us to respond timely to changing market conditions and consumer fashion preferences. Furthermore, we believe Burlington Stores’ substantial selection of staple, destination products attracts customers from beyond our local trade areas. We believe these products drive incremental store traffic and differentiate us from our competitors. 
 We believe the breadth of our selection and our ability to successfully operate in stores of varying square footage represents a competitive advantage. We believe that, as we continue to reduce our comparable store inventory, we will be able to reduce the square footage of our stores while continuing to maintain our broad assortment.

Our store base is geographically diversified with stores located in 45 states and Puerto Rico as set forth below:

Store Expansion and Real Estate Strategy 
 We continue to explore expansion opportunities both within our current market areas and in other regions. We believe that our ability to find satisfactory locations for our stores is essential for the continued growth of our business. The opening of stores generally is contingent upon a number of factors, including the availability of desirable locations with suitable structures and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms. 
 We have a proven track record of new store expansion. Our store base has grown from 13 stores in 1980 to 761 stores as of January 30, 2021. Based on the smaller store footprint enabled by our Burlington 2.0 strategy, as well as the opportunity presented by accelerating retail disruption and industry wide store closures, we have increased our long-term store target to 2,000 stores, up from our previous store target of 1,000 stores, which was established in connection with the Company’s IPO in 2013. If we identify appropriate locations, including locations that fit our 25,000 square foot store prototype, we believe that we will be able to execute our growth strategy without significantly impacting our current stores. The table below shows our store openings and closings each of the last three fiscal years.
 
 
 | Fiscal 2020 | | | Fiscal 2019 | | Fiscal 2018

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution and Warehousing 
 We have four distribution centers that shipped approximately 99% of merchandise units to our stores in Fiscal 2020. The remaining 1% of merchandise units are drop shipped by our vendors directly to our stores. Our two east coast distribution centers are located in Edgewater Park, New Jersey and Burlington, New Jersey. Our two west coast distribution centers are located in San Bernardino, California and Redlands, California. These four distribution centers occupy an aggregate of 2,884,000 square feet, and each includes processing, shipping and storage capabilities. In addition, we entered into a lease for an additional distribution center in Riverside, California occupying approximately 900,000 square feet, which is expected to become operational during Fiscal 2021.
 We also operate warehousing facilities to support our distribution centers. The east coast has three supporting warehouses located in Burlington, New Jersey. The west coast has two supporting warehouses, located in Redlands, California and San Bernardino, California. These five warehousing facilities occupy an aggregate of 2,058,000 square feet and primarily serve as storage facilities.

----+--------------------------------


(b) | The lease for this distribution center was signed during Fiscal 2018 and is expected to become operational during Fiscal 2021.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the distribution centers that we operate, we have arrangements with third parties for the use of pool point facilities, which we believe streamline and optimize our distribution network.
 Customer Service 
 We are committed to providing our customers with an enjoyable shopping experience in stores that are clean, neat and easy to shop. In training our employees, our goal is to emphasize knowledgeable, friendly customer service and a sense of professional pride. 
 We have empowered our store teams to provide an outstanding customer experience for every customer in every store, every day. We have streamlined processes and will continue to strive to create opportunities for fast and friendly customer interactions. Our goal for our stores is to reflect clean, organized merchandise presentations that highlight the brands, value and diversity of selection within our assortments. 
 Our Off-Price Sourcing and Merchandising Model 
 We believe that our “open to buy” off-price model enables us to provide our customers with products that are nationally branded, fashionable, high quality and priced right. We have an experienced team of General Merchandise Managers, Divisional Merchandise Managers and buyers that are continually focused on improving comparable store inventory turnover, inventory age and freshness of merchandise. 
 We continue to improve the quality of our brand portfolio, driven by the growth of our merchandising team, excellent product availability, and a vendor community increasingly committed to grow with Burlington. We carry many different brands, none of which accounted for more than 5% of our net purchases during Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019 or Fiscal 2018. We have no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers, and believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier. We continue to have good working relationships with our suppliers.
 We have designed our merchant organization so that buyers focus primarily on buying, planners focus primarily on planning, and information systems help inform data-driven decisions for both groups. Buyers are in the market each week and focus on purchasing great products for great value. We seek to purchase a majority of our merchandise in-season. Buyers spend time interacting face-to-face with new and existing vendors and on continuously evaluating trends in the market to which we believe our customers would respond positively. Our buyers use a merchant scorecard that rates products across four key attributes—fashion, quality, brand and price—to help formalize a framework for buying decisions.

Our merchandising model allows us to provide our customers with a wide breadth of product categories. Sales percentage by major product category is as follows: 
 
 
Category | Fiscal 2020(a) | | | Fiscal 2019(a) | | Fiscal 2018(a)
------------------------------+----------------+----+---+----------------+----+---------------
Women’s ready-to-wear apparel | | 21 | % | | 22 | % | 23 | %
Accessories and footwear | | 21 | % | | 22 | % | 22 | %
Menswear | | 19 | % | | 20 | % | 20 | %
Home | | 19 | % | | 15 | % | 15 | %
Youth apparel/baby | | 15 | % | | 16 | % | 16 | %
Coats | | 5 | % | | 5 | % | 5 | %

----+------------------------------------------

 The sales mix for Fiscal 2020 in the above table, particularly in the home category, was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may not be reflective of continuing trends.
 Human Capital Resources
 Attracting, developing and retaining top talent is key to our growth, and our success depends on cultivating an engaged and motivated workforce. Our goal is to create a welcoming, diverse and inclusive environment where our associates can build a career for life.
Oversight and Management
 Our Human Resources department is tasked with managing associate-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, compensation and benefits, performance management, and learning and development. In addition, our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as associate retention and workplace safety, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks.  This process is informed by the results of our annual associate survey, which is discussed in further detail below.
 
Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters.  For example, our Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, developing and reviewing executive management succession plans and reviewing the Company’s compensation policies for executives and associates generally to assess (i) whether the compensation structure establishes appropriate incentives and (ii) the risks associated with such policies and practices.  In addition, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight of the social, political and environmental trends, issues and concerns, including legislative and regulatory developments, that could significantly affect the public affairs of the company.
 Associates
 As of January 30, 2021, we employed 55,959 associates, including 41,426 part-time and seasonal associates. Of those associates, 87% worked in our stores, 9% worked in our distribution centers and 4% worked in our corporate organization. As of January 30, 2021, 75% of our associates self-identified as female and 76% of our associates self-identified as having a racial or ethnic minority background.
 Our staffing requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonality of our business. We hire additional associates and increase the hours of part-time associates during seasonal peak selling periods. As of January 30, 2021, associates at one of our stores were subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
The health and safety of our associates, as well as our customers and their families and the communities that we serve, is our top priority.  Health and safety measures that we implemented in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the support that we provided to our associates, are discussed above under the caption “COVID-19.”

Corporate Culture
 We recognize the critical importance of talent and culture to our success. Our value proposition, “Our Burlington,” which defines who we are as an employer and what’s important to us as a team, is based on five tenets: 

• | We Are an Off-Price Retailer: We deliver great values to our customers every day.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We Live by Our Core Values: Drive Results. Trust & Respect Each Other. Build Teams & Partnerships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We Believe Everyone Matters: We listen to the individual viewpoints of our diverse workforce through open and honest communication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We Win Together: We recognize those who make a difference. Great performance leads to exciting career opportunities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We Are a Caring Company: We have a caring work environment, and the generosity of our associates and customers helps to improve the communities we live and work in and beyond.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We conduct an annual associate survey to measure associate engagement.  The survey results help us understand the associate experience, evaluate our performance, identify our strengths and pinpoint opportunities for improvement.  Our 2019 survey, which included feedback from more than 30,000 associates, revealed: 92% believe Burlington makes it easy for people from diverse backgrounds to fit in and be accepted; 89% reported that their manager treats them with dignity and respect; and 88% believe in our Core Values.  As a result of the pandemic, we conducted an abbreviated corporate associate survey in 2020.  We anticipate resuming full associate surveys in 2021.
 Inclusion, Diversity and Equality
 Burlington is committed to advancing equality and social justice as we continue to build an inclusive and welcoming workplace.  To put these values into action, in Fiscal 2020 we launched Inclusion & Diversity 2.0, Burlington’s diversity action plan. Three main objectives drive the deliverables of our action plan:

• | Ensuring that we continue to provide an inclusive workplace culture where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued, so that they feel comfortable bringing their true selves to work each day.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing our pool of diverse talent in leadership roles through recruitment and the development and promotion of internal associates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrating our commitment to inclusion, diversity, and equality to our customers, vendors, and partners, as well as within the diverse communities we serve.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The focus areas of our action plan, aligned with these objectives, seek to create sustainable and long-term change organization-wide. To this end, our CEO signed on to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion in Fiscal 2020, making a commitment on behalf of Burlington to take action to cultivate environments where diverse experiences and perspectives are welcomed and where employees feel comfortable and encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion.
 Learning and Development
 We support our associates’ career growth by offering a blended learning approach that includes online education, on-the-job training, coaching and career development. All associates, including full- and part-time, in our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices, are offered training and development opportunities.  Our learning and development programs are integral to the development of our associates and enable them to take on new and expanded roles across our organization.
Compensation and Benefits
 As part of our commitment to offer competitive wages, Burlington works to ensure that our pay structure aligns with industry standards. In addition to being merit based, Burlington reviews compensation for all associates at every level of the business based on market analysis, seeking to ensure associates are fairly and appropriately compensated for their commitment to Burlington. Through this process, we have increased the wages of our hourly associates every year since 2010.  We also offer a wide array of benefits for our associates and their families, including health and wellness and retirement benefits.

Burlington Website
 During the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, we made a strategic business decision to transition from an e-commerce website to a marketing content-based website designed to inspire consumers to shop in stores. Today, Burlington.com highlights our great merchandise values and encourages customers to discover fantastic deals on the brands and products they love, from stylish apparel to everything they need for their entire family and home. Merchandise sold directly from our website represented approximately 0.5% of our total sales in Fiscal 2019.
Customer Demographic
 Our core customer is 25-49 years old, has an average annual household income of $25,000-$100,000, and is more ethnically diverse than the general population. The core customer is educated, resides in mid- to large-sized metropolitan areas and is a brand conscious fashion enthusiast. These customers shop for themselves, their family, and their home. We appeal to value seeking and brand conscious customers who understand the off-price model and love the thrill of the hunt.
Marketing and Advertising 
 We use a mix of broad-based and targeted marketing strategies to efficiently deliver the right message to our audience at the right time. Broad-based strategies include national and local television and radio. Our digital and streaming audio strategies allow for more personalized and targeted messaging. Email reaches our best customers, while social marketing, including relationships with influencers, allow for authentic consumer engagement.
Private Label Credit Card
 During Fiscal 2019, we launched a private label credit card program. The program has been rolled out to all of our stores. We believe this program has the potential to deepen customer loyalty, inform customer contact strategies, and drive increases in trip frequency and transaction size. 
Competition 
 The U.S. retail apparel and home furnishings markets are highly fragmented and competitive. We compete on the basis of a combination of factors, including, among others, price, breadth, quality and style of merchandise offered, in-store experience, level of customer service, ability to identify and respond to new and emerging fashion trends, brand image and scalability. We compete for business with department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores, online retailers, discount stores, wholesale clubs, and outlet stores, as well as with certain traditional, full-price retail chains that have developed off-price concepts. At various times throughout the year, traditional full-price department store chains and specialty shops offer brand-name merchandise at substantial markdowns, which can result in prices approximating those offered by us at our stores. 
Seasonality 
 Our business, like that of most retailers, is subject to seasonal influences. In the second half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons, we generally realize a higher level of sales and net income. Weather is also a contributing factor to the sale of our clothing. Generally, our sales are higher if the weather is cold during the Fall and warm during the early Spring.  Sales of cold weather clothing are increased by early cold weather during the Fall, while sales of warm weather clothing are improved by early warm weather conditions in the Spring. Although we have diversified our product offerings, we believe traffic to our stores is still driven, in part, by weather patterns.
Trademarks 
 We are the owner of certain registered and common law trademarks, service marks and tradenames (collectively referred to as the Marks) that we use in connection with our business. Our Marks include, but are not limited to, “Burlington Stores,” “BCF,” “Burlington,” “Burlington Coat Factory,” “Cohoes,” “MJM Designer Shoes,” “B” and “Baby Depot.” We consider these Marks and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. We believe that our rights to these properties are adequately protected. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used.
