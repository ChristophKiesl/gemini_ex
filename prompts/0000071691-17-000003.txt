ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
The New York Times Company (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 26, 1896, under the laws of the State of New York. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “we,” “our” and “us.”
We are a global media organization focused on creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news and information. Our continued commitment to premium content and journalistic excellence makes The New York Times brand a trusted source of news and information for readers and viewers across various platforms. Recognized widely for the quality of our reporting and content, our publications have been awarded many industry and peer accolades, including 119 Pulitzer Prizes and citations, more than any other news organization. 
The Company includes newspapers, print and digital products and investments. We have one reportable segment with businesses that include:

• | our newspaper, The New York Times (“The Times”);


• | our websites, including NYTimes.com;


• | our mobile applications, including The Times’s core news applications, as well as interest-specific applications such as NYT Cooking, Crossword and others; and


• | related businesses, such as The Times news services division, product review and recommendation websites The Wirecutter and The Sweethome, digital archive distribution, NYT Live (our live events business) and other products and services under The Times brand.

We generate revenues principally from circulation and advertising. Circulation revenue is derived from the sale of subscriptions to our print, web and mobile products and single-copy sales of our print newspaper. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of our advertising products and services on our print, web and mobile platforms. Revenue information for the Company appears under “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
During 2016, the Company continued to focus on investing in original, quality journalism across its print and digital platforms. Among other things, we launched groundbreaking digital journalism projects and created compelling special inserts in our print newspaper. In addition, we continued to create innovative digital advertising solutions across our platforms and continued to expand our branded content studio.

We also made a number of acquisitions during the year. In March 2016 and August 2016, we acquired digital marketing agencies, HelloSociety and Fake Love, respectively, for a total of $15.4 million. And in October 2016, we acquired product review and recommendation websites The Wirecutter and The Sweethome for $25.0 million. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions. 
The Company sold the New England Media Group in 2013 and the Regional Media Group and the About Group in 2012. The results of operations for these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these discontinued operations. 
PRODUCTS
The Company’s principal business consists of distributing content generated by our newsroom through our print, web and mobile platforms. In addition, we distribute selected content on third-party platforms. The Times’s print edition, a daily (Mon. - Sat.) and Sunday newspaper in the United States, commenced publication in 1851. The NYTimes.com website was launched in 1996. The Times also has an international edition that is tailored and edited for global audiences. First published in 2013 and previously called the International New York Times, the international edition succeeded the International Herald Tribune, a leading daily newspaper that commenced publishing in Paris in 1887. 
Our print newspapers are sold in the United States and around the world through individual home-delivery subscriptions, bulk subscriptions (primarily by schools and hotels) and single-copy sales. All print home-delivery subscribers are entitled to receive unlimited digital access.
Since 2011, we have charged consumers for content provided on our core news websites and mobile applications. Digital subscriptions can be purchased individually or through group corporate or group education subscriptions. Our metered model offers users free access to a set number of articles per month and then charges users for access to content beyond that limit. In addition, certain subscriptions include access to Times Insider, a suite of exclusive online content and features.
In addition to our core news websites and mobile applications, the Company has a number of websites and mobile applications that are tailored to a variety of interests, including NYT Cooking and our Crossword product. 
CIRCULATION AND AUDIENCE
Our content reaches a broad audience through our print, web and mobile platforms. As of December 25, 2016, we had approximately 2.9 million paid subscriptions in 195 countries to our print and digital products, and in early 2017, we surpassed three million paid subscriptions to our products. 
In the United States, The Times had the largest daily and Sunday circulation of all seven-day newspapers for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, according to data collected by the Alliance for Audited Media (“AAM”), an independent agency that audits circulation of most U.S. newspapers and magazines.
For the fiscal year ended December 25, 2016, The Times’s average print circulation (which includes paid and qualified circulation of the newspaper in print) was approximately 571,500 for weekday (Monday to Friday) and 1,085,700 for Sunday. (Under AAM’s reporting guidance, qualified circulation represents copies available for individual consumers that are either non-paid or paid by someone other than the individual, such as copies delivered to schools and colleges and copies purchased by businesses for free distribution.)
Internationally, average circulation for the international edition of our newspaper (which includes paid circulation of the newspaper in print and electronic replica editions) for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2016, and December 27, 2015, was approximately 197,000 (estimated) and 215,000, respectively. These figures follow the guidance of Office de Justification de la Diffusion, an agency based in Paris and a member of the International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations that audits the circulation of most newspapers and magazines in France. The final 2016 figure will not be available until April 2017.
Paid digital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 1,853,000 as of December 25, 2016, an increase of approximately 46% compared with December 27, 2015. This amount includes paid subscriptions to our Crossword product, which totaled approximately 245,000 as of December 25, 2016. This amount also includes estimated group corporate and group education subscriptions (which collectively represent approximately 7% of total paid digital subscriptions to our news products). The number of paid group subscriptions is derived using the value of the

relevant contract and a discounted basic subscription rate. The actual number of users who have access to our products through group subscriptions is substantially higher.
According to comScore Media Metrix, an online audience measurement service, in 2016, NYTimes.com had a monthly average of approximately 85 million unique visitors in the United States on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices. Globally, including the United States, NYTimes.com had a 2016 monthly average of approximately 122 million unique visitors on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices, according to internal data estimates. 
ADVERTISING 
We have a comprehensive portfolio of advertising products and services that we provide across print, web and mobile platforms. Our advertising revenue is divided into three main categories: 
Display Advertising
Display advertising is principally from advertisers promoting products, services or brands, such as financial institutions, movie studios, department stores, American and international fashion and technology. In print, column-inch ads are priced according to established rates, with premiums for color and positioning. The Times had the largest market share in 2016 in print advertising revenue among a national newspaper set that consists of USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and The Times, according to MediaRadar, an independent agency that measures advertising sales volume and estimates advertising revenue. 
On our web and mobile platforms, display advertising comprises banners, video, rich media and other interactive ads. Display advertising also includes branded content on The Times’s platforms. Branded content is longer form marketing content that is distinct from The Times’s editorial content. In 2016, display advertising (print and digital) represented approximately 89% of advertising revenues.
Classified Advertising
Classified advertising includes line ads sold in the major categories of real estate, help wanted, automotive and other. In print, classified advertisers pay on a per-line basis. On our web and mobile platforms, classified advertisers pay on either a per-listing basis for bundled listing packages, or as an add-on to their print ad. In 2016, classified advertising (print and digital) represented approximately 5% of advertising revenues.
Other Advertising
Other advertising primarily includes creative services fees associated with our branded content studio and digital marketing agencies; revenues from preprinted advertising, also known as free-standing inserts; revenues generated from branded bags in which our newspapers are delivered; and advertising revenues from our news services business. In 2016, other advertising (print and digital) represented approximately 6% of our advertising revenues.
Our business is affected in part by seasonal patterns in advertising, with generally higher advertising volume in the fourth quarter due to holiday advertising.
COMPETITION
Our print, web and mobile products compete for advertising and consumers with other media in their respective markets, including paid and free newspapers, broadcast, satellite and cable television, broadcast and satellite radio, magazines, other forms of media and direct marketing. Competition for advertising is generally based upon audience levels and demographics, advertising rates, service, targeting capabilities and advertising results, while competition for consumer revenue and readership is generally based upon platform, format, content, quality, service, timeliness and price.
The Times competes for advertising and circulation primarily with national newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and USA Today; newspapers of general circulation in New York City and its suburbs; other daily and weekly newspapers and television stations and networks in markets in which The Times is circulated; and some national news and lifestyle magazines. The international edition of our newspaper competes with international sources of English-language news, including The Wall Street Journal’s European and Asian Editions, the Financial Times, Time, Bloomberg Business Week and The Economist.
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY – P. 3

As our industry continues to experience a shift from print to digital media, our products face competition for audience and advertising from a wide variety of digital media, including news and other information websites and mobile applications, news aggregation sites, sites that cover niche content, social media platforms, and other forms of media. In addition, we also compete for advertising on digital advertising networks and exchanges and real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels.
Our websites and mobile applications most directly compete for traffic and readership with other news and information websites and mobile applications. NYTimes.com faces competition from sources such as WSJ.com, washingtonpost.com, Google News, Yahoo! News, huffingtonpost.com, MSNBC.com and CNN.com. Internationally, our websites and mobile applications compete against international online sources of English-language news, including bbc.co.uk, guardian.co.uk, ft.com, WSJ.com, economist.com, huffingtonpost.com and reuters.com. 
OTHER BUSINESSES
We derive revenue from other businesses, which primarily include:

• | The Times news services division, which transmits articles, graphics and photographs from The Times and other publications to approximately 2,000 newspapers, magazines and websites in over 100 countries and territories worldwide. It also comprises a number of other businesses that primarily include our online retail store, product licensing, news digests, book development and rights and permissions;


• | The Company’s NYT Live business, which is a platform for our live journalism and convenes thought leaders from business, academia and government at conferences and events to discuss topics ranging from education to sustainability to the luxury business;


• | The Wirecutter and The Sweethome, product review and recommendation websites acquired in October 2016 that serve as a guide to technology gear, home products and other consumer goods. These websites generate affiliate referral revenue (revenue generated by offering direct links to merchants in exchange for a portion of the sale price), which we record as other revenues; and


• | Digital archive distribution, which licenses electronic archive databases to resellers of that information in the business, professional and library markets.

JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS 
We have noncontrolling ownership interests in three entities: 

• | 49% interest in Donahue Malbaie Inc., a Canadian newsprint company (“Malbaie”);


• | 40% interest in Madison Paper Industries, a partnership that previously operated a paper mill (“Madison”); and


• | 30% interest in Women in the World, LLC, a live-event conference business.

Ownership of Malbaie is shared with the Resolute FP Canada Inc. (“Resolute Canada”), which owns the other 51%. Resolute Canada is a subsidiary of Resolute Forest Products Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Resolute”), which is a large global manufacturer of paper, market pulp and wood products. Malbaie manufactures newsprint on the paper machine it owns within Resolute’s paper mill in Clermont, Quebec, and is wholly dependent upon Resolute for its pulp, which it purchases from this paper mill. In 2016, Malbaie produced approximately 226,000 metric tons of newsprint, of which approximately 12% was sold to us. 
The Company and UPM-Kymmene Corporation, a Finnish paper manufacturing company (“UPM”), are partners through subsidiary companies in Madison. The Company’s percentage ownership is through an 80%-owned consolidated subsidiary. UPM owns 60% of Madison, including a 10% interest through a 20% noncontrolling interest in the consolidated subsidiary of the Company. The Madison paper mill closed during 2016 and the joint venture is currently being liquidated. 
These investments are accounted for under the equity method and reported in “Investments in joint ventures” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 25, 2016. For additional information on these investments, see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
