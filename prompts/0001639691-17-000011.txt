Item 1.  Business
Background 
LivaNova PLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”, “LivaNova”, “we” or “our”) was organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cyberonics”) and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy (“Sorin”). As a result of the business combination, LivaNova became the holding company of the combined businesses of Cyberonics and Sorin. This business combination became effective on October 19, 2015, at which time LivaNova’s ordinary shares were listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market (“NASDAQ”) and on the London Stock Exchange (the “LSE”) as a standard listing under the trading symbol “LIVN.” On February 23, 2017, we announced our voluntary cancellation of our standard listing of ordinary shares with the London Stock Exchange due to the low volume of our ordinary share trading on the London Stock Exchange. Trading will cease at the close of business on April 4, 2017. LivaNova PLC is headquartered in London, United Kingdom (“U.K.”). 
Description of the Business
 We are a global medical device company focused on the development and delivery of important therapeutic solutions for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems throughout the world. Working closely with medical professionals throughout the world in the field of Cardiac Surgery, Neuromodulation and Cardiac Rhythm Management, we design, develop, manufacture and sell innovative therapeutic solutions that are consistent with our mission to improve our patients’ quality of life, increase the skills and capabilities of healthcare professionals and minimize healthcare costs. 
Description of the Mergers
On October 19, 2015, pursuant to the terms of a definitive Transaction Agreement entered into by LivaNova, Cyberonics, Sorin and Cypher Merger Sub (the “Merger Sub”), dated March 23, 2015, (the “Merger Agreement”) Sorin merged with and into LivaNova, with LivaNova continuing as the surviving company, immediately followed by the merger of Merger Sub with and into Cyberonics, with Cyberonics continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of LivaNova (the “Mergers”). Upon the consummation of the Mergers, the historical financial statements of Cyberonics became the Company’s historical financial statements. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Cyberonics are included in the comparative prior periods.
The issuance of LivaNova ordinary shares in connection with the Mergers was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-203510), as amended, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by LivaNova and declared effective on August 19, 2015. Further, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), LivaNova is deemed to be a “successor” issuer to Cyberonics. As such, the ordinary shares of LivaNova are deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and LivaNova is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Business Franchises
Upon completion of the Mergers, in October 2015, we reorganized our reporting structure and aligned our underlying divisions and businesses. LivaNova was then comprised of three principal Business Units: Cardiac Surgery, Neuromodulation and Cardiac Rhythm Management, corresponding to three main therapeutic areas. The historic Cyberonics operations were included under the Neuromodulation Business Unit, and the historical Sorin businesses were included under the Cardiac Surgery and Cardiac Rhythm Management Business Units. Corporate activities included corporate business development and New Ventures. New Ventures was focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion. The New Ventures group was created with contributions from both Cyberonics and Sorin. 
 In July 2016, we announced an organizational re-design that, in addition to our existing corporate support functions, included the addition of a Chief Operating Officer (“COO”). Damien McDonald joined the Company in October 2016 as the COO and was responsible for driving innovative product development, commercialization and geographic expansion across the global organization with a focus on margin expansion and profitable growth. In executing the new organizational model, we created new regional leadership positions in the United States (“U.S.”), Europe, and the rest of world to support our three Business Franchises, (formerly Business Units) corresponding to the three main therapeutic areas: Neuromodulation, Cardiac 
6

Surgery and Cardiac Rhythm Management. The New Ventures group continues unchanged. Our three reportable segments correspond to our Business Franchises.
For further information regarding the Mergers, our business segments, historical financial information and our methodology for the presentation of financial results, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cardiac Surgery Business Franchise 
LivaNova’s Cardiac Surgery (“CS”) Business Franchise is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiovascular surgery products, including oxygenators, heart-lung machines, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and accessories, and systems for autotransfusion and autologous blood washing, as well as implantable prostheses for the replacement or repair of heart valves. 
Cardiopulmonary Products 
During conventional coronary artery bypass graft procedures and heart valve surgery, the patient’s heart is temporarily stopped, or arrested. The patient is placed on an extracorporeal circulatory support system that temporarily functions as the patient’s heart and lungs and provides blood flow to the body. Our products include systems to enable cardiopulmonary bypass, including heart-lung machines, oxygenators, perfusion tubing sets, cannulae and accessories, as well as related equipment and disposables for autotransfusion and autologous blood washing for neonatal, pediatric and adult patients. Our primary cardiopulmonary products include: 
 Heart-lung machines. The heart-lung machine (“HLM”) product group includes heart-lung machines, heater coolers, related cardiac surgery equipment and maintenance services. 
 Oxygenators and perfusion tubing systems. The oxygenators product group, which includes oxygenators and other disposable devices for extracorporeal circulation, the new InspireTM, HeartlinkTM and ConnectTM system. The Inspire range of products, comprised of 12 models, will enable perfusionists to replace the existing oxygenator lines with more advanced systems capable of delivering better performance and greater flexibility. The total modularity of this new range of products will also help reduce production time and costs, providing perfusionists with a more customized approach to further benefit patients. 
ConnectTM. ConnectTM is our innovative and intuitive perfusion charting system. Focused on real time and retrospective calculations and trending tools, ConnectTM assists perfusionists with data management during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. InspireTM, HeartlinkTM and ConnectTM products can all be integrated with our HLM machines to deliver a unique perfusion solution combining hardware components, disposable devices and data management systems. 
 Autotransfusion systems. One of the key elements for a complete blood management strategy is autotransfusion, which involves the collection, processing and reinfusion of the patient’s own blood that is lost at the surgical site during the peri-operative period. 
 Cannulae. Our cannulae product family, which is part of the oxygenator product group, are perfusion tubing sets used to connect the extracorporeal circulation to the heart of the patient during cardiac surgery. 
Heart Valves and Repair Products 
We offer a comprehensive line of products to treat a variety of heart valve disorders, including a complete line of surgical tissue and mechanical valve replacements and repair products for damaged or diseased heart valves. Our heart valves and repair product offerings include: 
 Tissue heart valves. Our tissue valves include the MitroflowTM aortic pericardial tissue valve with phospholipid reduction treatment (“PRT”) which is designed to mitigate valve calcification, and the Crown PRTTM and Solo SmartTM aortic pericardial tissue valves. Crown PRTTM is the latest advancement in stented aortic bioprosthesis technology, featuring surgeon-friendly design, PRT technology, and state-of-the-art hemodynamic and durability performance. Crown PRTTM enables intuitive intraoperative handling through a short rinse time, enhanced ease of implant through visible markers and improved radiographic visualization through dedicated X-ray markers. Our Solo SmartTM aortic pericardial tissue valve is an innovative, completely biological aortic heart valve with no synthetic material and a removable stent. Solo SmartTM provides the ease of implantation of a stented valve with the hemodynamic performance of a stentless valve. 
 Self-anchoring tissue heart valves. PercevalTM is LivaNova’s sutureless bioprosthetic device designed to replace a diseased native valve or a malfunctioning prosthetic aortic valve using either traditional or minimally invasive heart surgery 
7

techniques. PercevalTM incorporates a unique technology that allows 100% sutureless positioning and anchoring at the implantation site. This, in turn, offers the potential benefit of reducing the time the patient spends in cardiopulmonary bypass.
Mechanical heart valves. Our wide range of mechanical valve offerings includes the Carbomedics StandardTM, Top HatTM and Reduced Series Aortic ValvesTM, as well as the Carbomedics Carbo-SealTM and Carbo-Seal ValsalvaTM aortic prostheses. We also offer the Carbomedics StandardTM, OrbisTM and OptiformTM mechanical mitral valves. 
Heart valve repair products. Mitral valve repair is a well-established solution for patients suffering from a leaky mitral valve, or mitral regurgitation. LivaNova offers a wide range of mitral valve repair products, including the Memo 3DTM and Memo 3D ReChordTM, AnnuloFloTM and AnnuloFlexTM. 
Neuromodulation Business Franchise
Our Neuromodulation Business Franchise designs, develops and markets neuromodulation-based medical devices for the treatment of epilepsy and depression. 
VNS Therapy System
Our seminal neuromodulation product, the VNS Therapy® System, is an implantable device authorized for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression (“TRD”). The VNS Therapy System consists of: an implantable pulse generator and connective lead that work to stimulate the vagus nerve; surgical equipment to assist with the implant procedure; equipment and instruction manuals enabling a treating physician to set parameters for a patient’s pulse generator; and magnets to manually suspend or induce nerve stimulation. The VNS Therapy pulse generator and lead are surgically implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the upper left chest area, generally during an out-patient procedure; the lead (which does not need to be removed to replace a generator battery) is connected to the pulse generator and tunneled under the skin to the vagus nerve in the lower left side of the patient’s neck. 
VNS for the treatment of epilepsy. Globally, there are several broad types of treatment available to persons with epilepsy: multiple seizure medications, various forms of the ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, resective brain surgery, trigeminal nerve stimulation, responsive intracranial neurostimulation and deep brain stimulation. Seizure medications typically serve as a first-line treatment and are prescribed for virtually all patients diagnosed with epilepsy. After two seizure medications fail to deliver seizure control, the epilepsy is defined as drug-resistant, at which point, adjunctive non-drug options are considered, including VNS therapy, brain surgery and a ketogenic diet. 
In the U.S., our VNS Therapy System was the first medical device treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in 1997 for refractory drug resistant epilepsy in adults and adolescents over 12 years of age and is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures. Other worldwide regulatory bodies have also approved the VNS Therapy System for the treatment of epilepsy, many without age restrictions or seizure-type limitations. Patients with epilepsy can also use a small, handheld magnet provided with our VNS Therapy System to activate or inhibit stimulation manually. We sell a number of VNS product models for the treatment of epilepsy, including our Model 102 (PulseTM), Model 102R (Pulse DuoTM), Model 103 (Demipulse®), Model 104 (Demipulse Duo®), Model 105 (AspireHC®) and Model 106 (AspireSR®) pulse generators. To date, an estimated 100,000 patients have been treated with VNS Therapy System for epilepsy. 
Our Aspire SR® generator provides the benefits of VNS Therapy, with an additional feature: automatic stimulation in response to detection of changes in heart rate potentially indicative of a seizure. The AspireSR® generator is capable of delivering additional stimulation automatically by responding to a patient’s relative heart-rate changes that exceed certain variable thresholds, which are adjustable. Heart-rate changes accompany seizure activity in certain patients. The thresholds are programmed by the patient’s physician and can be adjusted to suit the patient’s level of physical activity or for other reasons.
8

In May 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a national determination of non-coverage within the United States with respect to reimbursement of the VNS Therapy System for patients with TRD, significantly limiting access to this therapeutic option for most patients. As the result of lack of access following this determination, we have not engaged in active commercial efforts with respect to TRD in any of our markets, however, in the future we intend to re-engage in limited commercial efforts in certain international markets. As a result of new clinical evidence, including the completion of a post-approval dosing study and other studies that have resulted in more than five recent publications in peer-reviewed journals, we submitted a formal request to CMS for reconsideration of VNS therapy for TRD.  CMS declined our request for reconsideration in May 2013. In October 2013, two Medicare beneficiaries appealed the lack of coverage by Medicare through the Departmental Appeals Board (“DAB”) of the Department of Health and Human Services. In January 2015, DAB concluded that the record relating to the non-coverage conclusion by CMS is complete and adequately supports the non-coverage determination.
Cardiac Rhythm Management Business Franchise 
The Cardiac Rhythm Management (“CRM”) Business Franchise develops, manufactures and markets products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure. These products include implantable devices, leads and delivery systems and information systems for the management of patients with CRM devices. 
Cardiac Rhythm Management Products 
The following are the principal products offered by the CRM Business Franchise: 
Implantable Cardiac Pacemakers. A pacemaker is a battery-powered device implanted in the chest that delivers electrical impulses to treat bradycardia, a condition of abnormally slow heart rhythms or unsteady heart rhythms that cause symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, fatigue and shortness of breath. Our pacemakers include the REPLYTM and ESPRITTM models, which have received both FDA clearance and CE mark certification, and the KORA 100TM model which has received CE mark certification. In 2015, we launched in Europe KORA 250TM pacemakers. LivaNova’s latest generation of pacemaker systems is compatible with 1.5 Tesla MRI machines. 
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators. Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (“ICDs”) continually monitor the heart and deliver therapy when an abnormal heart rhythm such as tachyarrhythmia, or rapid heart rhythm, occurs and leads to sudden cardiac arrest. Our latest generation ICD is the PLATINIUMTM, which has CE mark certification and which features industry leading battery longevity, advanced shock reduction technology and a contoured shape with thin, smooth edges that better fits inside the body. Other ICDs include the PARADYMTM 2 family of ICDs. PLATINIUM was approved in Europe in the second quarter of 2015, in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2015, and in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2016. 
Implantable Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Devices. Implantable Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy devices (“CRT-Ds”) treat heart failure patients by altering the abnormal electrical sequence of cardiac contractions by sending tiny electrical impulses to the lower chambers of the heart to help them beat in a more synchronized fashion. Our latest generations of CRT-Ds use the SonRTM technology that provides heart failure patients with automatic and frequent hemodynamic CRT optimization both at rest and exercise using a unique hemodynamic sensor embedded in the SonRtipTM atrial sensing/pacing lead. SonRTM technology is found in INTENSIATM, PARADYM RFTM, PARADYM 2TM and the most recent PLATINIUMTM families of CRT-Ds. We have FDA approval for PLATINIUMTM CRT-D since the third quarter of 2016 and the PARADYM RFTM SonR CRT-D is under clinical investigation in the U.S. 
Patient Management Tools. Our Smartview system enables remote monitoring of patients with certain Sorin ICDs and CRT-Ds, by enabling transmission of data from the patient’s ICD or CRT-D to their healthcare provider using a portable monitor that is connected to the patient’s telephone line. 
Cardiac Rhythm Management Developments 
In November 2015, we launched the PLATINIUM implantable cardiac defibrillator (“ICD”) in Europe. In September 2016, we announced the launch in the U.S. During 2015, we continued the development of our IS4 PLATINIUM CRTD with SonR dedicated to the use of quadripolar left ventricular catheters with IS-4 compatibilities. This product was launched in Europe in December 2016. The development of new ranges of leads for defibrillation and left ventricular stimulation also enjoyed significant progress with the completion of the pre-qualification phase.

In June 2015, we announced the European launch of a full body MRI conditional pacemaker, the KORA 250. The KORA 250 is equipped with our proprietary Automatic MRI mode. In addition, the device is designed to proactively manage comorbidities, including a pacing mode that manages all types of atrioventricular block (“AV”), referred to as “SafeR”, and the ability to monitor patients for severe sleep apnea using Sleep Apnea Monitoring (“SAM”). In the first quarter 2016, the KORA 250 was approved and launched in Japan.
In June 2013, following FDA approval to initiate a clinical trial under an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”), the first patients were enrolled in the United States in the Respond CRT clinical trial (cardiac resynchronization therapy). The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the SonR CRTTM system in patients affected by advanced heart failure. In October 2014, Sorin announced having completed enrollment in the Respond CRTTM clinical trial, enrolling 1,039 patients in the study. In May 2016, we announced results from the Respond CRTTM clinical trial, showing that a 35% risk reduction in heart failure hospitalization was associated with SonR. In August 2016, we announced the results from the 18-month follow-up period that confirm significant long-term risk reduction in heart failure hospitalization.
During 2014, we executed a joint venture with MicroPort Scientific Corporation to enter China’s CRM market, and in the same year also completed the acquisition of Oscor Inc.’s CRM leads business, including a manufacturing facility in the Dominican Republic. In particular, the joint venture agreement with MicroPort Scientific Corporation to market and develop CRM devices in China will enable LivaNova to establish a local presence in China and accelerate its penetration of the rapidly growing Chinese market. The joint venture is based in Shanghai and became operational in the first half of 2014. MicroPort owns 51% of the joint venture, and LivaNova owns the remaining 49%. 
Research and Development
The markets in which LivaNova participates are subject to rapid technological advances. Product improvement and innovation are necessary to maintain market leadership. Our research and development efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets LivaNova serves to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new uses for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. That commitment leads us to initiate and participate in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. We also expect our development activities to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. 
Approximately 16% of our employees work in research and development. Our research and development activities include improving existing products and therapies, expanding their uses and applications and developing new products. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation and continue to assess LivaNova’s research and development programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to the customer.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the transitional period April 25, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the fiscal years ended April 24, 2015 and April 25, 2014, we spent $122.5 million, $51.4 million, $42.2 million and $45.2 million on research and development, respectively.
Corporate Activities and New Ventures
Corporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology, corporate business development and New Ventures. 
The New Ventures group was created to evaluate growth opportunities and new potential areas of investment for the Company to expand our product portfolio to meet emerging patient needs. In particular, New Ventures focuses on innovative technologies to treat three main pathologies: heart failure, sleep apnea and mitral valve regurgitation, areas of unmet clinical need where there is no optimal therapeutic solution for the majority of patients. New Ventures partners with public and private institutions and medical startups to develop future therapeutic solutions in these areas. 
Acquisitions and Investments
Our strategy of providing a broad range of therapies requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through research and development efforts, LivaNova has historically relied, and expects to continue to rely, upon acquisitions, investments and alliances to provide access to new technologies in both new and existing markets. 
10

LivaNova expects to further its strategic objectives and strengthen its existing businesses by making future acquisitions or investments in areas that it believes it can acquire or stimulate the development of new technologies and products. Mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that any of our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
Patents and Licenses 
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2016, we held more than 2,100 issued patents worldwide, with approximately 640 patent applications pending that cover various aspects of our technology. U.S. patents typically have a 20-year term from the application date and patent protection outside the United States varies by country. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage. We have also obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products, and maintain certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are considered to be of material importance to our business segments and operations. We regularly review third-party patents and patent applications in an effort to protect our intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights. 
We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Patent litigation can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties.
For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “Risk Factors Relating to LivaNova’s Business-We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing its patent and other proprietary rights against others.”
Markets and Distribution Methods 
The three largest markets for our medical devices are Europe, the United States and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity. We sell most of our medical devices through direct sales representatives in the United States and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the United States.
Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide - including physicians, perfusionists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, hospitals and other medical institutions and healthcare providers. To achieve this objective, we maintain a highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales staff that is able to foster strong relationships with physicians, perfusionists, hospitals and other customers. We maintain excellent working relationships with professionals in the medical industry, which provides us with a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments, trends and emerging opportunities enabling us to respond quickly to the changing needs of providers and patients. We actively participate in medical meetings and conduct comprehensive training and educational activities in an effort to enhance our presence in the medical community, and believe that these activities also contribute to healthcare professional expertise. 
11

Due to the emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the current trend among hospitals and other medical device customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups in order to enhance purchasing power. As a result, customer transactions have become increasingly complex. Enhanced purchasing power may also lead to pressure on pricing and an increase in the use of preferred vendors. Our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve.
12

Customers, Competition and Industry 
We compete in the medical device market in over 5,000 hospitals in more than 100 countries. This market is characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our competitors, across our product portfolio, range from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of specialized products. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies. 
Product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts and publications about our products can cause major shifts in industry market share, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In addition, because of developments in managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we may be increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products. 
Cardiac Surgery
The primary medical professionals who use our Cardiopulmonary products are perfusionists and cardiac surgeons. All Cardiopulmonary products are sold in a competitive market where pricing can be a relevant factor. Our competitors include Terumo Medical Corporation, Maquet Medical Systems, Medtronic Global, Haemonetics Corporation, Edwards Lifesciences and St. Jude Medical (now Abbott), although not all competitors are present in all product lines. 
Neuromodulation
The primary medical professionals who use Neuromodulation products are neurologists, neurosurgeons and ENT surgeons, although customers are hospitals and healthcare systems, and in some cases, government health departments. Primary medical device competitors in the Neuromodulation product group are NeuroPace, Inc. and Medtronic Global.
Cardiac Rhythm Management
The primary medical specialists who use our CRM products include electrophysiologists, implanting cardiologists, heart failure specialists and cardiac surgeons. All CRM products are sold in a competitive market where features offered and pricing can be significant competitive factors. Primary competitors in the CRM business are Medtronic Global, St. Jude Medical (now Abbott), Boston Scientific and Biotronik. 
Production, Quality Systems and Raw Materials 
We manufacture a majority of our products at 11 manufacturing facilities located in Italy, France, Germany, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia and the Dominican Republic. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a plan to exit the Costa Rica manufacturing operation and we expect to complete the exit plan in the first half of 2017. In addition, we are building a manufacturing facility in Suzhou (China). We purchase raw materials and many of the components used in our manufacturing facilities from numerous suppliers in various countries. For quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness purposes, we may procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. 
The quality systems we utilize in the design, production, warehousing and distribution of our products are designed to ensure that our products are safe and effective. Some of the governmental agencies and quality system regulations with which we are required to comply are as follows:

• | The FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) under section 520 of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations at 21 C.F.R. Part 820.


• | The International Standards Organization - (“ISO”) EN ISO 13485:2012, Medical devices - Quality management systems.


• | The Independent certification bodies, DEKRA, LNE/G-MED and TUV SUD act as our notified bodies to ensure that our manufacturing quality systems comply with ISO 13485:2003.


• | The European Council Directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC, ISO 13485, which relates to medical devices and active implantable medical devices.

In addition, we utilize environmental management systems and safety programs to protect the environment and our employees. Some of the regulations and governmental agencies with which we comply are as follows: 
13


• | The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)


• | The Occupational Health and Safety Assessment System (“OSHAS”)


• | The European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”)


• | Italian regulations under the Integrated Environmental Authorization acts


• | ISO 14001 certification

Government Regulation and Other Considerations 
Our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and similar agencies outside the United States. To varying degrees, each of these agencies require LivaNova to comply with laws and regulations governing the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, advertising, promotion, record keeping, reporting, tracking, and importing and exporting of its medical devices. Our business is also affected by patient privacy and security laws, cost containment initiatives, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide. The primary laws and regulations that affect our business are described below. 
The laws applicable to LivaNova are subject to change and evolving interpretations. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, LivaNova and its officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including substantial fines and damages, and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by government programs, among other potential enforcement actions. 
United States 
Each medical device LivaNova seeks to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the agency. Under the FDA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) pre-market notification requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device, are categorized as Class III, requiring approval of a pre-market approval (“PMA”) application. 
510(k) Clearance Process 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, LivaNova must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared 510(k) device, a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of approval PMA application, or a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. In rare cases, Class III devices may be cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA is obtained. In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, the ability to rescind previously granted 510(k)s and additional requirements that may significantly impact the process. 
Pre-market Approval Process 
A PMA application must be submitted if the medical device is in Class III (although the FDA has the discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process) or cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, pre-clinical and clinical trials, and manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. 
14

After a PMA application is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA will usually be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, which imposes elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including, among other things, the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or supplements are required for significant modifications to the design of a device, indications, labeling of the product and manufacturing process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data, the convening of an advisory panel or pre-approval inspections. 
Clinical Studies 
One or more clinical trials may be required to support a 510(k) application and are almost always required to support a PMA application. Clinical trials of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If human clinical trials of a device are required and the device presents a significant risk, the sponsor of the trial must file an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and/or laboratory testing. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more institutional review boards (“IRBs”), human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of institutional investigational sites with the specific number of patients approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements including, for example, investigator selection, monitoring of the clinical trial sites, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and trial protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements. LivaNova, the FDA and the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. 
15

Continuing Regulation 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing in the United States, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply, and LivaNova will continue to be subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine its compliance with these requirements, as will its suppliers, contract manufacturers and contract testing laboratories. These requirements include, among others: 

• | the QSR, which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, modify, label, exercise quality control over and document manufacturing and quality issues regarding their products;


• | Establishment Registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA;


• | Medical Device Listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA;


• | Labeling and claims regulations, which require that all advertising and promotion of devices be truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use, and that all claims be substantiated;


• | Prohibition of marketing devices for off-label uses, including requirements relating to dissemination of articles and information and responding to unsolicited requests for off-label information;


• | Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulations, which requires reporting to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if a device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;


• | Reporting and record keeping for certain corrections or removals initiated by a manufacturer to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health;


• | Statutory and regulatory requirements for Unique Device Identifiers (“UDIs”) on devices and submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (“GUDID”); and


• | In some cases, ongoing monitoring and tracking of a device’s performance and periodic reporting to the FDA of such performance results.

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. The FDA periodically inspects our manufacturing facilities, which potentially includes our suppliers. If the FDA observes conditions that may constitute violations, we must correct the conditions or satisfactorily demonstrate the absence of the violations. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by us. We continue to expend resources to maintain compliance with our obligations under the FDA’s regulations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include one or more of the following sanctions:

• | untitled letters or warning letters;


• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;


• | mandatory recall or seizure of our products;


• | administrative detention or banning of our products;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new product versions;


• | revocation of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals previously granted; and


• | criminal prosecution and penalties.

Other than the U.S. 
Outside the United States, LivaNova is subject to government regulation in the countries in which it operates. Although many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA, these regulations vary significantly from country to country and with respect to the nature of the particular medical device. The time required to obtain foreign approvals to market our products may be longer or shorter than the time required in the United States, and requirements for such approvals may differ from FDA requirements. 
16

In the European Economic Area (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union (“EU”) plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE mark. To obtain CE mark certification, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety and quality (i.e., the essential requirements) set out in the EU Medical Devices Directives (Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices and Council Directive 90/385/EEC on Active Implantable Medical Devices). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices, where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directives, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. Following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body issues a certificate that entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. Manufacturers with CE marked devices are subject to regular inspections by Notified Bodies to monitor continued compliance with the applicable directives and essential requirements. 
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. 
In the EEA, clinical trials for medical devices usually require the approval of an Ethics Committee and approval by or notification to the national competent authorities. Both regulators and Ethics Committees also typically require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
In September 2012, the European Commission published proposals for the revision of the EU regulatory framework for medical devices. The proposal would replace the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive with a new regulation (the Medical Devices Regulation). Unlike the Directives that must be implemented into national laws, the Regulation would be directly applicable in all EEA Member States and so is intended to eliminate current national differences in regulation of medical devices.
In October 2013, the European Parliament approved a package of reforms to the European Commission’s proposals. Under the revised proposals, only designated “special notified bodies” would be entitled to conduct conformity assessments of high-risk devices, such as active implantable devices. These special notified bodies will need to notify the European Commission when they receive an application for a conformity assessment for a new high-risk device. The European Commission will then forward the notification and the accompanying documents on the device to the Medical Devices Coordination Group (“MDCG”), (a new, yet to be created, body chaired by the European Commission, and representatives of Member States) for an opinion. These new procedures may result in the re-assessment of our existing medical devices, or a longer or more burdensome assessment of our new products. In May 2016, a political agreement was reached and the tentatively agreed upon text was published in June 2016.
Once the legislative process is complete, the Medical Devices Regulation is expected to enter into force sometime in 2017 and become applicable three years thereafter. In its current form it would, among other things, also impose additional reporting requirements on manufacturers of high risk medical devices, impose an obligation on manufacturers to appoint a “qualified person” responsible for regulatory compliance, and provide for more strict clinical evidence requirements.
The national competent authorities of the EEA countries, generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health, oversee the clinical research for medical devices and are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. We are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws setting forth the medical device directives.

To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval, or “shonin.” The Japanese government, through the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”), regulates medical devices under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (“PAL”). Oversight for medical devices is conducted with participation by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”), a quasi-government organization performing many of the review functions for MHLW. Penalties for a company’s noncompliance with PAL could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. MHLW and PMDA also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the requirements of the PAL. LivaNova is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies. 
Many countries in which we operate (outside of the EU, United States, or Japan) have their own regulatory requirements for medical devices. Most countries outside of the EU, United States or Japan require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. Because export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations are complex and constantly changing, we cannot ensure that laws and regulations may not be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute our products. 
 Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, existing regulations. Certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect that this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future. We cannot ensure that any new medical devices it develops will be approved in a timely or cost-effective manner, or approved at all. 
Promotional Restrictions
Both before and after a product is commercially released, LivaNova has ongoing responsibilities under various laws and regulations governing medical devices. In addition to FDA regulatory requirements, the FDA and other U.S. regulatory bodies (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice and various state Attorneys General) monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses and can only market its products for cleared or approved uses. 
Governmental Trade Regulations 
The sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subjects LivaNova to extensive governmental trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across international borders. Many countries control the export and re-export of goods, technology and services for reasons including public health, national security, regional stability, antiterrorism policies and other reasons. Some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In certain circumstances, approval from governmental authorities may be required before goods, technology or services are exported or re-exported to certain destinations, to certain end-users and for certain end-uses. Because LivaNova is subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which it operates, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import and export activities. 
In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct export activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If these third parties violate applicable export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products, we may be subject to varying degrees of liability dependent upon our participation in the transaction. The activities of these third parties may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sales of our products, or result in restrictions being placed upon our international distribution and sales of products, which may materially impact LivaNova’s business activities.

Patient Privacy and Security Laws 
Various laws worldwide protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers. Privacy standards in Europe and Asia are becoming increasingly strict, enforcement action and financial penalties related to privacy in the EU are growing, and new laws and restrictions are being passed. The management of cross-border transfers of information among and outside of EU member countries is becoming more complex, which may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data. We will continue our efforts to comply with those requirements and to adapt our business processes to those standards. 
In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys new general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. LivaNova potentially operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances. In those cases, the patient data that we receive may include protected health information, as defined under HIPAA. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. Nonetheless, these requirements affect a limited subset of our business. While LivaNova has not been named in any such suits, if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur, LivaNova could become a target of such litigation. 
Cost Containment Initiatives 
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where LivaNova does business. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the extent of coverage or amount of reimbursement available for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Hospitals, which purchase implants, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and in some cases limit the number of vendors that can participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning their interests with physicians’ through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, whereby a hospital agrees with physicians to share certain realized cost savings resulting from the physicians’ collective change in practice patterns, such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate, and participation in affordable care organizations. Such alignment has created increasing levels of price sensitivity among customers for our products. 
Some third-party payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical device may be cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of coverage. 
19

In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), for example, has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices, which due to subsequent legislative amendments, has been suspended from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2018. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. The Affordable Care Act also implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals on spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction of several government programs. These included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals. 
International examples of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in markets significant to our business include Japan, where the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years. Such reviews may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or result in the denial of coverage for those procedures. As a result of our manufacturing efficiencies, cost controls and other cost-savings initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to respond to changes resulting from this worldwide trend toward cost-containment; however, uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation or other reforms, making it difficult for LivaNova to predict the potential impact of cost-containment trends on future operating results. 
Applicability of Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations 
Our worldwide business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the “U.K. Bribery Act”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions where it operates.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws 
LivaNova is also subject to U.S. federal and state government healthcare regulation and enforcement and government regulations in non-U.S. countries in which it conducts its business. These laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and physician sunshine laws and regulations and are further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, under the heading “Risk Factors - Our failure to comply with rules relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, false claims, and privacy and security laws may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business operations.”
The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the U.S. government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. The majority of states in the U.S. also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
Additionally, violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant financial liability, in its investigation and prosecution of device and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
20

HIPAA includes federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program; willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense; and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, the FCPA can be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the United States, if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. There are similar laws and regulations applicable to LivaNova outside the United States, all of which are subject to evolving interpretations.
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on certain device manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers must submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, it may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect its ability to operate its business and its financial results. 
Environmental Health and Safety Laws 
LivaNova is also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide. Like other medical device companies, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials. To the best of our knowledge at this time, LivaNova does not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
Working Capital Practices 
Our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to ensure adequate supply of raw materials from suppliers and meet the product delivery needs of our customers. To meet the operational demands of our customers, we also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, LivaNova employed more than 4,500 employees worldwide. Our employees are vital to our success, and we are engaged in an ongoing effort to identify, hire, manage and maintain the talent necessary to meet our business objectives. We believe that we have thus far been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly-competitive labor market due, in large part, to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment, fostering employee professional training and development and providing employees with opportunities to contribute to LivaNova’s continued growth and success. 
Seasonality 
For all product segments, the number of medical procedures incorporating our product sales is generally lower during the summer months due to summer vacation schedules. This is particularly relevant to European countries.
