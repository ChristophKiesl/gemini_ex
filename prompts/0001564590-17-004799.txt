ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Historical Company Information
 Golf Rounds, Inc. was incorporated in 1968 as a Florida corporation.
 On May 28, 2014, and through a series of related, subsequent transactions (the “Merger” and such agreement effectuating the Merger, the “Merger Agreement”), we merged with Fuse Medical, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Legacy Fuse”). As a result of the Merger, we acquired Legacy Fuse and the business of Legacy Fuse became our business. For more information on the Merger, see the Company’s Form 8-K/A filed on August 29, 2014, which is herein incorporated by reference.
 On the Closing Date, we entered into the Purchase Agreement, as described in the section of this Annual Report above entitled “Explanatory Note,” which is incorporated herein by reference.
 Overview
 Historically our business has been to market, distribute and sell orthopedic and foot and ankle surgical implants, osteobiologics, regenerative amniotic tissues, and other related surgical products for use during surgical procedures conducted at medical facilities (ambulatory surgical centers and hospitals) where orthopedic surgeons treat patients and perform operations. We market, distribute and sell a variety of existing FDA-approved and/or state licensed products and services manufactured or produced by other organizations where we are considered a distributor and/or a stocking distributor. Currently, these products consist of plates and screws for internal fixation of small bone fractures, human allografts of bone chips and tendons, and regenerative amniotic tissues and fluids. The amniotic products are derived from the inner layer of the human placenta or harvested from amniotic fluid. The tissues are then processed by accredited tissue banks resulting in FDA-approved allografts, which are indicated to decrease inflammation and scarring in surgical procedures. Amniotic products have historically made up over 50% of our revenues.
 
We have recently expanded our product portfolio of surgical implants to now include multiple manufacturers’ offerings of not only foot and ankle internal and external fixation products, but also upper extremity plating for elective orthopedic trauma, soft tissue fixation and augmentation for sports medicine procedures, total joint reconstruction for both upper and lower extremities, and full spinal implants for trauma, degenerative disc disease and deformity indications.
 We believe that by expanding our product lines, a comprehensive selection of orthopedic, sports medicine and spinal implant products, we can be more relevant to our customers and also have the ability to rapidly grow upon our existing customer base.
 We utilize our physician relationships, corporate partners, facility relationships, and distribution channels, as well as their knowledge of the healthcare industry to further our business objectives. We believe all sales are made in compliance with both the Stark Law and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as further discussed below.
 Product Distribution Channels and Customer Base
 We utilize multiple distribution models including representative networks and independent contractors. Our largest customers are hospitals and surgical facilities. We distribute some products on behalf of manufacturers and, in some cases, receive a commission related to sales numbers. In most cases, we purchase products directly from manufacturers or authorized distributors and resell the products from existing inventory. We are attempting to build a network of specialists in select clinical specialties, many of whom we believe are leaders in their field, and anticipate they will clinically utilize the Company’s products. These network specialists may include heads of teaching hospitals, universities and clinical resident and fellowship programs at some of the most respected institutes in the nation.
 For products we sell on a commission basis, we receive payment from the manufacturer or distributor. For products sold from our inventory, we receive payment directly from our customers. In the year ended December 31, 2016, 87% of our revenues were derived from two customers. Amniotic products have historically made up the largest portion of our business. We recognize that the diversification and growth of our customer base will be instrumental to our long-term strategic and financial success.
 Our principal supplier for our amniotic products is CPM, which is majority owned and controlled by our Chairman of the Board. We entered into a distributor agreement with CPM effective August 2, 2012, pursuant to which we act as a non-exclusive distributor of certain amniotic membrane products. The term of the agreement is one year and renews on each annual anniversary date for successive one-year terms unless it is terminated in writing by either party. During December 2015 through May 2016, we purchased certain amniotic membrane products from SLR Medical Consulting, LLC (“SLR”) under a December 15, 2015 distributor agreement

with SLR pursuant to which we act as a non-exclusive distributor. The term of the agreement is one year and renews on each annual anniversary date for successive one-year terms unless it is terminated in writing by either party. During 2016 and 2015, we generated revenues of approximately $383,000 and $1,202,000, respectively, from the CPM and SLR distributor agreements.
 On July 17, 2014, we entered into an Independent Representative Agreement with Vilex, Inc. (“Vilex”) pursuant to which we were appointed as a representative of Vilex to promote and sell Vilex products in the United States. The Vilex products include certain plates, screws, and related equipment. Under the terms of the agreement with Vilex, we were a non-exclusive representative of Vilex, except for certain specified customers. The agreement with Vilex was for a term of five years and it would have automatically renewed for additional one-year periods at the expiration of the original term unless terminated as provided therein. We were paid a commission based on net sales. During 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately $22,000 and $46,000, respectively, from Vilex for commissions under this agreement. On November 15, 2016, due to low sales volume resulting from Vilex being excluded from a hospital purchasing contract, Vilex terminated this agreement.
 On January 8, 2015, we entered into a distribution and supply agreement with BioDlogics, LLC (“BioD”), pursuant to which we were appointed as a non-exclusive distributor of certain products of BioD and granted the right to promote and sell such products in the United States. The term of the agreement with BioD is from January 8, 2015, through December 31, 2016, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement. The BioD agreement set forth a quota for the purchase of the products by us from BioD for the first year of the agreement, which the Company exceeded. During 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately $153,000 and $420,000, respectively, of revenues from this agreement.  We have not been provided notice from BioD as to whether BioD intends to renew this agreement.
 For each of our suppliers, we are dependent upon their ability to obtain raw materials to manufacture the products that they supply to us to market, distribute and sell.
 Competition
 With respect to sales and distribution of most of the products we offer, we have numerous vertically integrated competitors, several of which are publicly traded, that not only manufacture and produce their own products but also have established distribution and sales networks and participate in large group purchasing organizations. Most of these competitors have linked physicians to their entities by engaging select physician and surgical specialists through consulting agreements, clinical trials remuneration and other compensation models. In addition, there are numerous independent medical distributorships primarily focused on limited geographic markets and products located across the United States.
Intellectual Property
 We hold no registered intellectual property, patents or trademarks.
 Regulatory Issues
 There are both federal and state regulations that may impact our ability to fully implement our strategic plan.
 FDA Regulations
 The manufacturers and suppliers of the products we market are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), other federal governmental agencies and by state authorities. These laws and regulations govern the approval of, clearance of or license to commercialize medical devices, biological products and human cellular and tissue products; including compliance with the standards and requirements related to the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion and sales of the products, record keeping requirements, tracking of devices, reporting of potential product defects and adverse events, conduct of corrections and recalls, and other matters. As a distributor and marketer of such FDA-regulated products, we are subject to independent requirements to register and list certain products, we may be required to obtain state licensure or certifications and we may be subject to inspections, in addition to complying with requirements applicable to the manufacturers of the products we market. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from warning letters to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecutions.
Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
 We are directly and indirectly subject to certain federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the “AKS”) is a criminal statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, in cash or otherwise, in return for referrals of federal healthcare beneficiaries. The Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) has promulgated certain safe harbors that offer protection 
 5

from liability under the AKS for arrangements that fall within very specific parameters. The Company intends to utilize the “small investment interest safe harbor” in the AKS as a business model.
 The Stark Law prohibits a provider of designated health services (“DHS”) from billing Medicare for any DHS that a physician refers to the provider if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship (either via a compensation arrangement or ownership interest) directly or indirectly with or in that provider. We are not a provider of DHS and therefore we believe the Stark Law does not apply to us.
 Employees
 As of March 20, 2017, the Company had two employees and one independent contractor.
