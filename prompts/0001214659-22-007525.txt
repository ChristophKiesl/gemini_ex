General Background of the Company
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 29, 2009 as Premier Oil Field Services, Inc. and changed its name to American Metals Recovery and Recycling Inc. on April 25, 2014. The Company was dormant from 2015 until February 2021.
 
On August 2, 2021, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 to register the Company’s shares of common stock, $0.001 par value (“Common Stock”) under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company received no proceeds as result of such registration.
 
Prior to December 23, 2021, Repository Services LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (“Repository Services”), held 8,123,230 shares, or 73.3% of the issued and outstanding shares of, Common Stock and 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 (“Preferred Stock”), of the Company. On December 23, 2021, Multiband Global Resources, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Multiband”), acquired 7,923,230 shares, or 71.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of, Common Stock and 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in exchange for a cash payment of $500,000 paid by Multiband to Repository Services. Also in December 2021, Repository Services transferred the remaining 200,000 shares of Common Stock that were not purchased by Multiband to Katell Survivors Trust (Gerald Katell, Trustee), an unrelated third party.
 
Since September 25, 2015, the Company has met the definition of a "shell" company, whose sole purpose was to locate and consummate a merger or acquisition with a privately-held operating company private entity.
 
On January 21, 2022, the Company issued a Secured Promissory Note (“Note”) to GNET ATC, Inc. (“GNET”) in an aggregate principal amount of $44 million. The Note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum and matures on January 21, 2025 (the “Maturity Date”). The principal balance of the Note must be repaid in equal monthly installments commencing September 23, 2022, with the final payment due on the Maturity Date. Interest is calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed and is payable as a balloon payment on the Maturity Date. Prepayments are permitted subject to certain terms and conditions. The Note is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The proceeds of the Note were used for working capital and to fund the acquisition of AMR Resources, LLC (“AMR Resources”) as described below.
 
On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding limited liability company interests of AMR Resources for $40.5 million in cash (the “AMR Resources Acquisition”), pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement (the “AMRR Agreement”), dated February 1, 2022, by and between the Company and OnePath Systems, LLC (“OnePath”), subject to post-closing adjustment as contemplated therein. In contemplation of the AMR Resources Acquisition, OnePath formed AMR Resources and contributed those assets necessary for the operation of its integrated services business. As a result of the AMR Resources Acquisition, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests of AMR Resources and the former integrated services business of OnePath and AMR Resources became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

Business Objectives of the Company
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company’s operations consist of the commercial activities of AMR Resources which was acquired on February 1, 2022. AMR Resources designs, deploys and maintains integrated low-voltage systems for the commercial and residential market. This includes Life Safety, Physical Security, Audio-Visual, Networking and Structured Cabling solutions.  With approximately 300 employees and over 5,000 subcontractors, AMR Resources has a national footprint, with a heavy concentration in the Southeastern United States and is headquartered in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area.
 
The Company had no business operations from September 25, 2015 until February 1, 2022, when the AMR Resources Acquisition was consummated. Management (which includes possible participation by our majority shareholder) intends to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue additional business acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire one or more additional operating businesses. The Company will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and the Company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature and we have not established any particular criteria upon which we consider a business opportunity. This discussion of potential business acquisitions herein is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of the Company's virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities. Management anticipates that it may be limited in our ability to participate in potential business venture because the Company has nominal assets and limited financial resources.
 
General Overview
 
COVID-19.
 
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and other events (such as a significant outbreak of variations thereof or other infectious diseases could adversely affect) have adversely affected, the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate an initial business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Many of the COVID-19 restrictions that had been imposed in the United States during the pandemic have since been lifted and commercial activity in the United States generally has increasingly returned to pre-pandemic practices and operations, although recent variants of the virus have caused increased infections and resulted in governments and businesses implementing or adopting certain requirements. It is possible that COVID-19 restrictions may be reimposed and our business may be materially adversely affected.
Company is a Shell Company with Penny Stock.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company is a shell company under Rule 405 and 12b-2 of the Exchange Act which defines a shell company as an issuer that that has no or nominal operations and either (i) no or nominal assets, (ii) assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or (iii) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.

The Company’s common stock is a “penny stock,” as defined in Rule 3a51-1 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as the common stock of the Company is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell the Company’s common stock.
 
As a shell issuer, we lack the availability of the use of Rule 144 by security holders and the lack of liquidity in our stock.
 
Effect of Amended Rule 15c2-11 on the Company’s securities.
 
The SEC released and published a Final Rulemaking on Publication or Submission of Quotations without Specified Information amending Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act (the "Amended Rule 15c2-11"). To be eligible for public quotations on an ongoing basis, Amended Rule 15c2-11 modifies the "piggyback exemption" that required that (i) the specified current information about the company is publicly available, and (ii) the security is subject to a one-sided (i.e. a bid or offer) priced quotation, with no more than four business days in succession without a quotation. Under Amended Rule 15c2-11, shell companies like the Company (and formerly suspended securities) may only rely on the piggyback exemption in certain limited circumstances. The Amended Rule 15c2-11 requires, among other requirements, that a broker-dealer has a reasonable basis for believing that information about the issuer of securities is accurate. Our security holders may find it more difficult to deposit common stock with a broker-dealer, and if deposited, more difficult to trade the securities on the Pink Sheets. The Company intends to provide the specified current information under the Exchange Act but there is no assurance that a broker-dealer will accept our common stock or if accepted, that the broker-dealer will rely on our disclosure of the specified current information.

Unavailability of Rule 144 for Resale.
 
Rule 144(i) “Unavailability to Securities of Issuers With No or Nominal Operations and No or Nominal Non-Cash Assets” provides that Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by an issuer that is a shell company. We have identified our company as a shell company and, therefore, the holders of our securities may not rely on Rule 144 to have the restriction removed from their securities without registration or until the Company is no longer identified as a shell company and has filed all requisite periodic reports under the Exchange Act for the period of twelve (12) months.
 
As a result of our classification as a shell company, our investors are not allowed to rely on the “safe harbor” provisions of Rule 144, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with the sale of our securities until one year from the date that we cease to be a shell company. This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings because purchasers of securities in such unregistered offerings will not be able to resell their securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted securities usually rely to resell securities.
 
Very Limited Liquidity of our Common Stock.
 
Our Common Stock occasionally trades on the Pink Sheets and there is a very limited active market in our common stock. As a result, there is only limited liquidity in our Common Stock.
 
Russia-Ukraine Conflict
 
The Russian-Ukraine conflict is a global concern. The Company does not have any direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine through its operations, employee base, investments or sanctions. We have not yet experienced direct effects from the conflict. We have no basis to evaluate the possible risks of this conflict.
