ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
XPO Logistics, Inc., a Delaware corporation together with its subsidiaries (“XPO,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”), is a top ten global provider of cutting-edge supply chain solutions to the most successful companies in the world. The Company operates as a highly integrated network of people, technology and physical assets. We use our network to help customers manage their goods more efficiently throughout their supply chains. As of December 31, 2016, we served more than 50,000 customers and operated with over 87,000 employees and 1,425 locations in 34 countries. 
We run our business on a global basis, with two segments: Transportation and Logistics. Within each segment, we have built robust service offerings that are positioned to capitalize on fast-growing areas of customer demand. Substantially all of our businesses operate under the single brand of XPO Logistics. 
In our Transportation segment, we are the second largest freight brokerage provider globally, and we hold industry-leading positions in both North America and Europe. In North America, we are the largest provider of last mile logistics for heavy goods; the largest manager of expedite shipments; the second largest provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation; the third largest provider of intermodal services; and a global freight forwarder with a growing network. In Europe, we have the largest owned road transportation fleet. We offer full truckload, freight brokerage and last mile services, and are the leading LTL provider in Western Europe. Our total lane density in Europe covers the regions that produce approximately 90% of the eurozone’s GDP.
Our Transportation segment uses a blended model of owned, contracted and brokered capacity. This gives us the flexibility to offer solutions that best serve the interests of our customers and the Company. As of December 31, 2016, globally, we had more than 10,000 independent owner operators under contract to provide drayage, expedite, last mile and LTL services to our customers, and more than 50,000 independent brokered carriers representing approximately 1,000,000 trucks on the road.
We employ professional drivers who transport goods for customers using our owned and leased trucks and trailers. This includes a global fleet of approximately 16,000 tractors and 39,500 trailers primarily related to our LTL and full truckload operations. These assets also provide capacity for our freight brokerage operations. Our company overall is asset-light, with assets accounting for just under a third of our revenue.
In our Logistics segment, we provide a range of contract logistics services, including highly engineered and customized solutions, value-added warehousing and distribution, cold chain solutions and other inventory management solutions. We perform e-commerce fulfillment, order personalization, warehousing, reverse logistics, storage, factory support, aftermarket support, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and labeling, as well as supply chain optimization services such as consulting and production flow management.

XPO operates approximately 157.5 million square feet (14.6 million square meters) of contract logistics facility space globally, with about 81.6 million square feet (7.6 million square meters) of that capacity in the United States, making us the second largest contract logistics provider globally.
Our global logistics footprint makes XPO particularly attractive to multinational customers. Once we secure a contract, the average tenure is approximately five years, and these relationships can lead to a wider use of our services, such as inbound and outbound logistics. Our logistics customers include the preeminent names in aerospace, retail and e-tail, technology, manufacturing, food and beverage, wireless, chemical, agribusiness, life sciences and healthcare. 
Our contract logistics operations also benefit from a strong presence in the high-growth e-commerce sector. E-commerce is predicted to continue to grow globally at a double-digit rate through at least 2020 and, increasingly, order fulfillment is being outsourced. We are the largest outsourced e-fulfillment provider in Europe, and we have a major platform for e-fulfillment in North America where we provide highly customized solutions that include reverse logistics and omni-channel services.
We believe that our ability to provide customers with integrated, end-to-end supply chain solutions gives us a competitive advantage. Many customers, particularly large companies, are increasingly turning to multi-modal providers to handle their supply chain requirements. We have built XPO to capitalize on this trend, as well as the trend toward outsourcing in both transportation and logistics, the boom in e-commerce, and the adoption of just-in-time inventory practices.
Our customers are served by well-trained XPO employees who understand the importance of world-class service, and who use our leading-edge, proprietary technology to perform their jobs. We have a global team of approximately 1,600 IT professionals who drive innovation for the benefit of our customers. Our annual investment in technology is among the highest in our industry because we see the ongoing development of our technology as being critical to our ability to continually improve customer service and leverage our scale.
Transportation Services
The Company’s Transportation segment includes five service lines: freight brokerage, last mile, LTL, full truckload and global forwarding.
Freight Brokerage
Our freight brokerage operations encompass truck brokerage globally, as well as intermodal, drayage and expedite services in North America. 
Our truck brokerage operations are non-asset-based: we place shippers’ freight with qualified carriers, primarily trucking companies. Customers offer loads to us via telephone, fax, email, electronic data interchange and the internet on a daily basis. These services are priced on either a spot market or contract basis for shippers. We collect payments from our customers and pay the carriers on a spot market basis for transporting customer loads.
Our intermodal operations are asset-light: we provide container capacity - some of which utilizes our 9,900 leased or owned 53-ft. containers and 8,000 chassis - rail brokerage, drayage transportation via independent contractors, and on-site operational services. We contract with railroads to provide the long-haul portion of the shipment of freight in containers, and we contract with trucking companies for the local pickup and delivery legs of the intermodal freight movement. We also provide customized electronic tracking and analysis of market prices and negotiated rail, truck and intermodal rates, in order to determine the optimal transportation routes. 
We offer our door-to-door intermodal services to a wide range of customers in North America, including large industrial and retail shippers, transportation intermediaries such as intermodal marketing companies, and steamship lines. As of December 31, 2016, XPO was the third largest provider of intermodal services in North America, with one of the largest U.S. drayage networks, and a leading provider of intermodal services in the cross-border Mexico sector.
Our expedite operations are predominantly non-asset-based: substantially all of the ground transportation equipment is provided by independent owner-operators who own one truck or van, or by independent fleet owners of multiple trucks or vans who employ multiple drivers. We are focused on developing strong, long-term relationships with our independent owner-operators and fleet owners, and incentivizing them to furnish their capacity to us on an exclusive basis. Expedite air charter service is arranged using the Company's relationships with third-party air carriers through our proprietary, web-based platform.
Our expedite services can be characterized as time-critical, time-sensitive or high priority freight shipments, many of which have special handling needs. This urgency typically arises due to tight tolerances in a customer’s supply chain, or an interruption or a failure elsewhere in the supply chain. 
Expedite customers most often request our services on a per-load transactional basis through our offices or via our expedite transportation management portal, with only a small percentage of loads scheduled for future delivery dates. We operate an ISO 
3

9001:2008-certified call center that gives our customers on-demand status updates relating to their expedited shipments. As of December 31, 2016, XPO was the largest manager of expedited freight shipments in North America.
Last Mile
Our last mile services are predominantly asset-light: we utilize independent contractors to perform transportation and over-the-threshold services. Last mile comprises the final stage of the delivery from a local distribution center or retail store to the end-consumer’s home or business, where more services may be required. Last mile is a fast-growing industry sector that serves blue chip retailers, e-commerce companies and smaller retailers with limited in-house capabilities. Important aspects of last mile service are responsiveness to seasonal demand, economies of scale, and an ability to maintain a consistently high quality of customer experience.
In addition, the last mile process often requires incremental services such as pre-scheduled delivery times, unpacking, assembly, utility connection and installation, as well as removal of an old product. These additional services are commonly referred to as white-glove services. We use our proprietary technology platforms to collect customer feedback, monitor carrier performance, manage capacity, and communicate during narrow windows of service to ensure a consumer experience that protects the brands of our retail customers.
Our last mile operations in North America and Europe specialize in heavy goods, including appliances, furniture, large electronics and other goods that are larger-than-parcel. As of December 31, 2016, XPO was the largest provider of last mile services for heavy goods in North America.
Less-Than-Truckload (LTL)
In North America, our LTL operations are asset-based: we utilize employee drivers, our own fleet of tractors and trailers for line-haul, pick-up and delivery, and a network of terminals. We provide our customers with day-definite regional, inter-regional and transcontinental LTL freight services. As of December 31, 2016, XPO was the second largest provider of LTL services in North America, offering more next-day and two-day lanes than any other LTL network. Our coverage area in North America encompasses approximately 99% of all U.S. zip codes, with service in Canada.
In Europe, our LTL operations utilize a blended asset-based and asset-light model of Company fleet and contracted carrier capacity, with a network of terminals. We provide LTL services domestically in France, the United Kingdom and Spain. We also offer international LTL distribution across Europe.
Full Truckload
Our full truckload operations are asset-based: we provide customers in Europe with dedicated contract carrier services by utilizing our fleet of tractors and trailers. In addition, we provide transactional transportation of packaged goods, high cube products, and bulk goods. We provide full truckload services domestically in France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Romania, Italy, Portugal and Slovakia, and internationally across Europe. As of December 31, 2016, XPO was a leading provider of full truckload transportation in Europe.
Global Forwarding
Our global forwarding operations are asset-light: we provide logistics services for domestic, cross-border and international shipments through our relationships with ground, air and ocean carriers and a network of Company and agent-owned offices. Our forwarding capabilities are not restricted by size, weight, mode or location, and therefore are potentially attractive to a wide market base.
As part of our global forwarding network, we operate a subsidiary as a non-vessel operating common carrier (“NVOCC”) to transport our customers’ freight by contracting with vessel operators. We are also a customs broker, licensed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service. This enables us to provide customs brokerage services to direct domestic importers, other freight forwarders, NVOCCs and vessel operating common carriers.
Logistics Services
The Company’s Logistics segment, which we also refer to as supply chain, encompasses a range of contract logistics services, including highly engineered and customized solutions, as well as managed transportation services. As of December 31, 2016, XPO was the second largest global provider of contract logistics based on square footage, with one of the largest e-fulfillment platforms in Europe.
We provide our logistics customers with integrated services such as dedicated and shared warehousing, e-fulfillment order processing and personalization, reverse logistics, storage, factory support, aftermarket support, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution. In addition, we utilize our technology and expertise to solve complex supply chain challenges and create transformative solutions for our customers, while reducing their operating costs and improving production flow management.

Our logistics customers primarily operate in industries with high-growth outsourcing opportunities, such as high tech, e-commerce, telecommunications, aerospace and defense, healthcare, medical equipment, agriculture, food and beverage, and select areas of manufacturing. These customers have demanding requirements for quality standards, real-time data visibility, special handling, security, the management of large numbers of stock keeping units (“SKUs”), time-assured deliveries and high transaction volumes, with seasonal surges in the case of retail goods.
The Company is a top five global provider of managed transportation based on the value of freight under management. Our managed transportation offering includes a range of services provided to shippers who want to outsource some or all of their transportation modes, together with associated activities. These activities can include freight handling such as consolidation and deconsolidation, labor planning, inbound and outbound shipment facilitation, documentation and customs management, claims processing, and third party logistics, or 3PL, supplier management, as well as other services.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to use our highly integrated network of people, technology and physical assets to help customers manage their goods more efficiently throughout their supply chains. We deliver value to customers in the form of cost and risk reductions, process efficiencies, consistently reliable outcomes, technological innovations and customer service that is both highly responsive and proactive. 
We continue to optimize our existing operations by growing our sales force, implementing advanced information technology, cross-selling our services and leveraging our Company-wide capacity. In addition, we maintain a disciplined and comprehensive set of processes related to the recruiting, training and mentoring of employees, and for marketing to the hundreds of thousands of prospective customers that can use our services. Most important to our growth, we have instilled a culture of collaboration that focuses our efforts on delivering the results that matter to our customers and Company.
We will continue to grow the business in a disciplined manner, and with a compelling value proposition - integrated, innovative solutions for any company, of any size, with any combination of supply chain needs.
Management’s growth and optimization strategy for the Transportation segment is to:

• | Market our diversified, multi-modal offering to customers of all sizes, both new and existing accounts;


• | Cross-sell our Transportation segment solutions to customers of our Logistics segment;


• | Provide world-class service and solutions that satisfy our customers’ transportation-related supply chain goals;


• | Recruit and retain quality drivers, and best utilize our transportation assets;

• | Capture more share of spend with existing customers that potentially could use XPO for more of their logistics and/or broader supply chain needs;


• | Expand our relationships with existing customers that have business interests in both North America, Europe and Asia;


• | Cross-sell contract logistics and managed transportation solutions to customers of our Transportation segment;


• | Market the advantages of XPO’s proprietary technology and global network of logistics facilities;


• | Provide world-class service and solutions that satisfy our customers’ logistics-related supply chain goals; and


• | Integrate industry best practices with a focus on utilizing our advantages of scale to serve our customers and lower our administrative overhead.

Information Systems and Intellectual Property
One of the ways in which we empower our employees to deliver world-class service is through our information technology (“IT”). We believe that technology is a compelling differentiator in our industry. Technology represents one of the Company’s largest categories of investment within our annual capital expenditure budget, reflecting our belief that the continual enhancement of our cloud-based platform is critical to our success. We have an IT team of approximately 1,600 talented professionals who focus on driving innovation and advancing the effectiveness of our software. 
In our Transportation segment, our proprietary Freight Optimizer software for truck brokerage provides actionable pricing information, as well as cost effective, timely and reliable access to carrier capacity. We believe that these capabilities give us a 
5

competitive advantage. In 2015, we launched our proprietary Rail Optimizer software that optimizes all aspects of intermodal operations, including shipment management, capacity flow and asset management, market-based pricing, and shipment execution with rail providers.
In last mile logistics, our proprietary software provides real-time workflow visibility and customer experience management with superior consumer satisfaction ratings. For expedite, we utilize satellite tracking and communication units on the independently contracted vehicles that transport goods for our customers, thus enabling real-time electronic updates. A large component of our expedite operations is our proprietary bidding platform, which awards loads electronically based on carriers’ online bids and manages the transportation process almost entirely through technology. 
In 2016, in our LTL operations, we introduced proprietary pricing systems and deployed new handheld and tablet devices to improve the efficiency of dock workers and drivers. New software releases planned in 2017 include line-haul efficiency measures, dock engineering standards, and pickup and delivery optimization, among other developments.
In our Logistics segment, we have developed proprietary technology for the design and implementation of sophisticated contract logistics solutions for our customers. These solutions are most often utilized by large, multi-national and medium-sized corporations and by government agencies with complex supply chain requirements. The warehouses we run are becoming high-tech hubs, with a combination of automated systems and robotics that have led to important new efficiencies for our customers. Our software supports services such as omni-channel distribution, reverse logistics, transportation management, freight bill audit and payment, lean manufacturing support, aftermarket support and supply chain optimization.
XPO relies on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and non-competition agreements to establish and protect its intellectual property and proprietary technology. We have numerous registered trademarks, trade names and logos in the United States and international jurisdictions.
Customers, Sales and Marketing
Our Company provides services to a variety of customers ranging in size from small, entrepreneurial organizations to multi-national industry leaders. We have a diversified customer base that minimizes our concentration risk: in 2016, approximately 8% of our revenue was attributable to our top five clients, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 3% of revenue.
Our customers are engaged in a wide range of industries, including high tech, retail, e-commerce, manufacturing, telecommunications, aerospace and defense, life sciences, healthcare, medical equipment, agriculture, and food and beverage. In 2016, retail and e-commerce accounted for the largest portion of our global revenue at 26%, followed by food and beverage at 14%.
XPO is not reliant on the economy of any one country, region or industry. Our transportation services are primarily marketed in North America and Europe, whereas our logistics and global forwarding networks serve global markets with concentrations in North America, Europe and Asia. Based on where orders originated, approximately 60% of our 2016 revenue was generated in the United States, 13% in France, 12% in the United Kingdom, and 15% in other countries.
Competition
The transportation and logistics industry is highly competitive, with thousands of companies competing in domestic and international markets. XPO competes on service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities and price. Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies that offer the same services we provide - some with larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we have. In some cases, our customers also have internal resources to provide some of the same transportation and logistics services we provide to them. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, we must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
The health of the transportation and logistics industry will continue to be a function of domestic and global economic growth. However, we believe that we have structured the Company to derive additional benefits from the growth of e-commerce, and from a long-term outsourcing trend that should continue to help a number of our service sectors grow faster than the macro-environment.
Regulation
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the United States and in the other countries where we operate. Such regulations impact us directly and indirectly by regulating third-party transportation providers we use to transport freight for our customers. 
Regulation affecting Motor Carriers, Owner Operators and Transportation Brokers. In the United States, our subsidiaries that operate as motor carriers have licenses to operate as motor carriers from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). In addition, our subsidiaries acting as property brokers have property broker licenses from the FMCSA. Our motor carrier subsidiaries and the third-party motor carriers we engage in the 
6

United States must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug- and alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, records retention, vehicle inspection, driver qualification and minimum insurance requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to emissions, drivers’ hours-of-service, independent contractor eligibility requirements, onboard reporting of operations, air cargo security and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the California Air Resources Board, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our equipment, operations and independent contractor drivers. We and the third-party carriers we use are also subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements of the state or other local jurisdictions in which they operate. In other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, our operations are regulated, where necessary, by the appropriate governmental authority.
In 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”), which uses a Safety Management System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs,” which data, it is anticipated, will eventually be used for determining a carrier’s DOT safety rating under revisions to existing Safety Fitness Determination (“SFD”) regulations. In December 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”) was signed into law, which requires the FMCSA to review the CSA program to ensure that it provides the most reliable analysis possible. During this review period, the FAST Act requires the FMCSA to remove a property carrier’s CSA scores from public view. The FMCSA has since announced an SFD Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) that would revamp the current three-tier federal rating system for federally regulated commercial motor carriers.
Although the CSA scores are not currently publicly available, this development is likely to be temporary. As a result, once the program has been revamped, our fleet could be ranked worse or better than our competitors, and the safety ratings of our motor carrier operations could be impacted. Our network of third-party transportation providers may experience a similar result. A reduction in safety and fitness ratings may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified independent contractors and could cause our customers to direct their business away from XPO and to carriers with more favorable CSA scores, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
In the past, the subsidiaries through which we operate our expedited and intermodal drayage operations have exceeded the established intervention threshold in certain of the BASICs, and we may exceed those thresholds in the future. Depending on our ratings, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, or customers may be less likely to assign loads to us. We cannot predict the extent to which CSA requirements or safety and fitness ratings under SMS or SFD could adversely affect our business, operations or ability to retain compliant drivers, or those of our subsidiaries, independent contractors or third-party transportation providers. 
The FMCSA has proposed new rules that would require nearly all carriers, including XPO, to install and use electronic logging devices (“ELDs”). The proposed regulations would require ELDs to be installed and in use two years after publication of the final regulations. ELD installation will increase costs for, and may not be well-received by, independent contractors.
Our operations providing certain services in California are also subject to various regulatory initiatives such as the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach clean truck program effective in 2009, California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) truck regulation effective in 2010, and the Port of Oakland truck ban effective in 2010, each of which banned trucks that did not meet certain emission standards. To comply with these requirements, our motor carrier subsidiaries providing certain services in California have implemented programs to source truck capacity from independent owner-operators that meet these emissions requirements. Furthermore, the State of California has required diesel tractors, as well as 53-foot-long and certain other trailers operated in the state, to comply with designated fuel efficiency and other performance requirements by target dates occurring between 2011 and 2023. Compliance with California state and port regulations has increased rates payable to owner-operators operating in California, as well as new tractor costs; might increase the cost of new trailers operated in California; might require the retrofitting of pre-2011 model year trailers operated in California; and could diminish equipment productivity and increase operating expenses.
Regulations affecting our Subsidiaries Providing Ocean and Air Transportation. XPO Customs Clearance Solutions, Inc. (“XCCS”) and XPO GF America, Inc. (“XGFA”), two of the Company’s subsidiaries, are licensed as customs brokers by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) of DHS in each United States customs district in which they do business. All United States customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by CBP. In other jurisdictions in which we perform customs brokerage services, our operations are licensed, where necessary, by the appropriate governmental authority.
Our subsidiaries offering expedited air charter transportation are subject to regulation by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) of DHS regarding air cargo security for all loads, regardless of origin and destination. XPO Global Forwarding, Inc. (“XGF”), XGFA and XPO Air Charter also are regulated as “indirect air carriers” by the DHS and TSA. These agencies provide requirements, guidance and, in some cases, administer licensing requirements and processes applicable to the freight forwarding industry. We must actively monitor our compliance with such agency requirements to ensure that we have 
7

satisfactorily completed the security requirements and qualifications and implemented the required policies and procedures. These agencies generally require companies to fulfill these qualifications prior to transacting various types of business. Failure to do so could result in penalties and fines. The air cargo industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative actions that could affect economic conditions within the industry by requiring changes to operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to customers. We cannot predict the extent to which any such regulatory or legislative actions could adversely affect our business, but we strive to comply with all agency requirements.
For our international operations, XGF, XGFA and XCCS are members of the International Air Transportation Association (“IATA”), a voluntary association of airlines and freight forwarders that outlines operating procedures for forwarders acting as agents or third-party intermediaries for IATA members. A substantial portion of XPO’s international air freight business is transacted with other IATA members.
Additionally, XGF, XGFA and XPO Ocean Lines, Inc. (“XOL”), are each registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”), which establishes the qualifications, regulations and bonding requirements to operate as an OTI for businesses originating and terminating in the United States. XGL and XOL are also licensed NVOCCs and ocean freight forwarders.
Our international freight forwarding operations make us subject to regulations of the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Treasury and to various laws and regulations of the other countries where we operate. These regulations cover matters such as what commodities may be shipped to what destinations and to what end-users, unfair international trade practices, and limitations on entities with which we may conduct business.
Other Regulations. The Company is subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes.
Classification of Independent Contractors. Tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as private litigants, continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for employers of independent contractors and to heighten the penalties for employers who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees’ overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers that meet certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a longstanding, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if the “non-employees” are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an “employee” or a “non-employee”; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirements or “employee” or “non-employee” misclassifications. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If XPO’s independent contractor drivers are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under some or all of the following: federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.
Environmental Regulations. Our facilities and operations and our independent contractors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions from vehicles, engine-idling, fuel tanks and related fuel spillage and seepage, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. Similar laws and regulations may apply in many of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We may be responsible for the cleanup of any spill or other incident involving hazardous materials caused by our operations or business. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of cleanup of diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events, and none of these incidents materially affected our business or operations. We generally transport only hazardous materials rated as low-to-medium-risk, and a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. We also do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in 2017. Future changes in environmental regulations or liabilities from newly discovered environmental conditions or violations (and any associated fines and penalties) could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. U.S. federal and state governments, as well as governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate, have also proposed environmental legislation that could, among other things, potentially limit carbon, exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions. If enacted, such legislation could result in higher new tractor and trailer costs, reduced productivity and efficiency, and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Risk Management and Insurance
The Company maintains insurance for commercial automobile liability, truckers’ commercial automobile liability, commercial general liability, cargo/warehouse legal liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, and umbrella and excess umbrella liability, with coverage limits, deductibles and self-insured retention levels that we believe are reasonable given the varying historical frequency, severity and timing of claims. Certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments are made for accruals for insurance reserves and are subject to a high degree of variability. 
Seasonality
XPO’s revenue and profitability are typically lower for the first quarter of the calendar year relative to the other quarters. The Company believes this is due in part to the post-holiday reduction in demand experienced by many XPO customers, which leads to more capacity in the non-expedited and service-critical markets and, in turn, less demand for expedited and premium shipping services. In addition, the productivity of the Company’s fleet of tractors and trailers, independent contractors and transportation providers generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations. It is not possible to predict whether the Company’s historical revenue and profitability trends will occur in future periods.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 87,000 full-time and part-time employees. Our employee base is one of our most critical resources, and we view the recruitment, training and retention of qualified employees as being essential to our ongoing success. We believe that we have good relations with our employees, with strong programs in place for communication and professional development.
