Item 1. Business
Recent Developments Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak
 
All of the disclosures set forth in Item 1 below should be read in the context of the recent COVID-19 related developments discussed immediately below.  All of the disclosures recited in “Recent Developments Related to the COVID-19 Outbreak” are as of the date of this filing.
 
Beginning in late 2019, there were reports of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak in Wuhan, China, and the epidemic quickly spread to many provinces, autonomous regions, and cities in China as well as many parts of the world, including the U.S. and Malaysia. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. In response to the evolving dynamics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company has been following the guidelines of local authorities as it prioritizes the health and safety of its employees, contractors, suppliers and retail partners. The Company’s two showrooms and warehouse in Malaysia was closed from March, 2020 to May, 2020.  The Los Angeles facility has been closed since March 16, 2020 and reopened in full operation on June 1, 2020. On May 12, 2020, the Company’s Kuala Lumpur office and warehouse reopened for business. However, on August 28, 2020, Malaysia government extended the shutdown order to all business until March 5, 2021. The third-party contract manufacturers that the Company utilizes in China were closed from the beginning of the Lunar New Year Holiday at the end of January 2020 through the beginning of March 2020. Certain of the Company’s new products are being sourced from manufacturers in India starting in 2020. The factories in India suspended their operations as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic during March through early May 2020. Currently, the factories in India have resumed their operations. Economic activities in Malaysia were reopened on March 5, 2021 through the end of the six-month shutdown order imposed by Malaysia government on August 28, 2020. Shipping of products from Asia has experienced significant delays since the onset of the pandemic and the costs of shipping from Asia have increased since the onset; and we may experience shipping disruptions in the future.  Finally, the Company expects that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the United States and world economies will continue to have a material adverse impact on the demand for its products. Because of the significant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing and effectiveness of any vaccines, the extent of the business interruption and the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
 
The COVID-19 outbreak precludes in person sales meetings or visits being made out of all of the Company’s offices or attendance at furniture trade shows, but the Company continues to receive orders and solicit business via telephone and email.  However, the Company is experiencing reduced demand for its products and an increased level of purchase order cancellations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, though in 2020 we have been experiencing a 39.59% increase in orders placed with us online compared with 2019.
 
We do not have access to a revolving credit facility. On May 4, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately $139,802 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).  The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. On May 5, 2020, Diamond Bar Outdoors Inc. (“Diamond Bar”) was granted a loan from Cathay Bank in the aggregate amount of $176,294, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program. In June 19, 2020, Diamond Bar was granted a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan in the aggregate amount of $150,000, pursuant to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan. We currently believe that our financial resources will be adequate to finance our operations through the outbreak for the next 12 months. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in the future, the outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.
 
Many of our employees are currently working remotely, and our systems appear adequate to address the current demands on our employees. We do not expect that the remote working arrangements will materially and adversely impact our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. While there can be no assurance, at the present time we do not expect the outbreak-related circumstances to result in material impairments of our assets or to significantly affect management’s judgements in assessing the fair value of our assets.

Human Capital Resources
 
We understand that our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain our employees. We strive to attract, recruit, and retain employees through competitive compensation and benefit programs, learning and development opportunities that support career growth and advancement opportunities, and employee engagement initiatives that foster a strong Company culture. In addition to cash compensation, we offer customary benefits in accordance with local regulatory requirements as well as performance based stock options to our employees. We also recognize the importance of keeping our employees safe. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and have followed local government orders to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020, we had 35 full time employees worldwide.  Our U.S. corporate office and operations employed 28 full-time employees, our location in Malaysia and Hong Kong employed 6 and 1 a total of 7 full-time employees, respectively. We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.

Our Products
 
We design and market modern residential and commercial furniture in diverse markets worldwide. Our products feature urban and contemporary styles, combining comfort and functionality in matching furniture collections and upscale luxury pieces appealing to lifestyle-conscious middle and upper middle-income consumers. We also sell physiotherapeutic jade mats for use in therapy clinics, hospitality, and real estate projects in Malaysia and other regions in Southeast Asia. Many of our products are segments of multi-component furniture collections in distinctive design styles, attractively priced in the medium and upper-medium ranges. Our product lines feature upholstered, wood and metal-based furniture pieces. We classify our products by room, designation or series, such as living room, dining room, bedroom and home office series, and by category or product types such as sofas, chairs, dining tables, beds, entertainment consoles, cabinets and cupboards. Our largest selling product categories for the year ended December 31, 2020 were sofas, beds and coffee table, which accounted for approximately 52%, 14% and 8% of sales from our continuing operations, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our largest selling product categories were sofas, cabinets and beds, which accounted for approximately 50%, 13% and 10% of sales from our continuing operations, respectively. Our products are manufactured primarily from medium-density fiberboard, or MDF board, and particleboard covered with veneers or lacquers and combined with other materials, including steel, glass, marble, leather, jade and fabrics.
 

Our product offerings consist of a mix of furnishings designed by us, and sourced from third party manufacturers that are supervised under our rigorous quality control processes. Through market research, customer feedback, and ongoing design development, we identify the latest trends and customer needs in target markets to develop new products, collections and brands. Our product collections are designed to appeal to consumer preferences in specific markets. We develop both individual furniture pieces and complete furniture collections that equip an entire home which feature matching furniture suites, providing convenient home furnishing options for lifestyle-conscious consumers.
 
We generally introduce new collections and launch new design styles at international furniture exhibitions or trade fairs. Our products are displayed in our showrooms. We further support our new product launches with product brochures and online marketing campaigns. Our staff collects customer feedback and collaborates with customers worldwide to design store and showroom layouts. In marketing materials, we highlight matching furniture collections by displaying complete and fully accessorized whole-room settings instead of individual furniture pieces. We believe that such in-store presentations provide convenient, one-stop solutions to customers, and thus incentivize clients to purchase an entire room of furniture from us instead of shopping for individual pieces offered by different brands or manufacturers. Our products are designed by our own designers. Customer orders are filled by third party manufacturers under our direct quality control. We believe that our products feature superior materials, attractive appearances, superb functionalities and satisfying price points generally desired by today’s middle to upper middle-income consumers worldwide.

International Markets
 
We sell products to the U.S., Canadian, Mexico, Honduras, Dominican Republic and Middle Eastern markets under the Diamond Sofa brand. We believe that discretionary purchases of furniture by middle to upper middle-income consumers will continue to increase in the furniture markets worldwide. We also believe that furniture products that feature contemporary design styles such as ours will continue to attract significant customer demand.
 
In 2020, our products were sold in 7 countries worldwide, with North America and Asia our principal international markets. Sales to North America accounted for 95.6% and 46.3% of sales from our continuing operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Sales to other regions, primarily in other Asian countries, accounted for 4.4% and 53.7% of our total sales from our continuing operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, via our subsidiary, Nova Malaysia, we marketed and sold high-end physiotherapeutic jade mats for use in therapy clinics, hospitality, and real estate projects in Malaysia. As we continue to broaden our distribution network, increase direct sales and grow in the emerging markets, we believe that we are well positioned to respond to changing market conditions that will allow us to take advantage of any upturns in the global and local economies of the markets that we serve. That said, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect the economies of each of the countries in which we market our products, which has adversely affected our ability to generate revenues in 2020. In addition, our ability to market our products in 2020 had been adversely impacted by government imposed quarantines and closures, supply chain and shipping disruptions and our current inability to make sales calls and to attend furniture shows.
 
Our expansion in Malaysia with health line products has also been disrupted due to COVID-19. Our initial plan was to establish showrooms in which consumers can interact with our products. Through research, we found that consumers were becoming more self-aware about their health and were willing to improve their lifestyles. Our showrooms were stocked and ready for local consumers to visit, however, due to government regulations these operations have been suspended until quarantines and travel restrictions are lifted.
 
Our global logistics and delivery capabilities provide our customers with the flexibility to select from our extensive furniture collections to address their respective needs. We design and supply our products under our own brands. We also design and ship products for other major brands as their OEM designer or supplier. We offer a wide selection of stand-alone furniture pieces across a variety of product categories and approximately over 200 products developed exclusively for the international markets.  We also sell products under the Diamond Sofa brand to distributors and retailers in North America and South America and to end-user U.S. consumers our own online orders or through third-party shopping portals. Reflecting market demand, our research and development team works closely with customers to timely modify our existing product designs. We also offer custom-designed styles for specific market segments. Once the COVID-19 outbreak dissipates, we plan to grow both online and offline sales.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategies target middle class, urban consumers, including: (1) direct sales to the U.S. and international customers; (2) internet sales and online marketing campaigns; and (3) participation in exhibitions and trade shows.
 
We diversify our customer base by increasing direct sales to a broad range of retailers and chain stores across the U.S. and international markets. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales and marketing efforts in North America, and in particular the U.S., which historically is the largest market worldwide for imported furniture. We intend to expand the “Diamond Sofa” brand and introduce new brands for direct sales in the U.S. and international markets while continuing to offer custom-made products under private label.
 
Diamond Bar also currently sells products under the Diamond Sofa brand in the U.S. through third party shopping portals, shipping orders received online directly to the end customer.  We believe that our planned direct-to-consumer online sales and marketing strategies will increase our sales in the U.S. by building our brand awareness and acting as an effective advertising vehicle. We also support new product collections and brand launches with print and online advertising campaigns, participation in furniture exhibitions and by offering product brochures and samples. We provide samples and brochures of new products for international markets to distributors and buyers, as is common in the furniture industry.

We gain new customers by attending many international furniture trade shows throughout the year. During these events, we introduce new product offerings and launch new design collections. We believe this marketing process helps us to develop and detect the latest-trends in the marketplace, allowing us to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing distributors and buyers with whom we have long–standing customer relationships. Each year, we present new products at the International Famous Furniture Fair (3F) in Dongguan, China and the China International Furniture Exhibition in Shanghai, China. We also exhibit products under the “Diamond Sofa” brand during the Las Vegas Market (U.S.) and the High Point Market (U.S.) trade shows. Internationally, we participate in trade fairs in collaboration with our customers. We plan to expand our business in the Middle East by attending several furniture exhibitions in those markets. To highlight our latest design collections, we maintain year-round showrooms at the Company’s headquarters in California as well as the High Point Market and Las Vegas Market. As of the date of this filing all of trade fairs have been delayed or canceled, and all of the showrooms referenced above are closed due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and we cannot project when they will be rescheduled and reopened. 
 
In 2020, via our new subsidiary Nova Malaysia, we have marketed and sold high-end physiotherapeutic jade mats for use in therapy clinics, hospitality, and real estate projects in Malaysia. 
 
Suppliers and Manufacturers
 
We source finished goods from third-party manufacturers to fulfill orders placed by customers through Nova Macao and Diamond Bar for the U.S. and international markets. Our five principal suppliers of finished goods in 2020 accounted for approximately 80% of our total purchases for our continuing operations in 2020.  By maintaining relationships with multiple suppliers, generally we benefit from a more stable supply chain and better pricing. Under ordinary circumstances, if a change of suppliers is necessary, we believe that we can quickly fulfill our requirements from other suppliers without interruptions in order fulfillment.  We monitor our suppliers’ ability to meet our product needs and we participate in quality assurance activities to reinforce our high-quality standards. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter durations. We issue production orders to manufacturers based on individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure products from other sources at our discretion.  None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for sourcing raw materials, agreeing to produce parts and finished products to our specifications. We hold our suppliers to high quality standards and delivery deadlines. Our quality control procedures may extend to stringent requirements for raw material suppliers.
 
The third party contract manufacturers that we utilize in China were closed from the beginning of the Lunar New Year Holiday at the end of January 2020 through the beginning of March 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and recommenced production and shipment in early March 2020. Starting in 2020, certain of the Company’s new products are being sourced from manufacturers in India. The factories in India suspended their operations as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic during March through early May 2020. Currently, the factories in India have resumed their operations. Shipping of products from Asia has experienced significant delays since the onset of the pandemic and the costs of shipping from Asia have increased since the onset; and we may experience shipping disruptions in the future.  The Company expects that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there will be significant disruptions in the production and shipment of product from those manufacturers, and it is possible that our China-based manufacturers may experience future suspensions of operations as a result of the resurgence of COVID-19. The situation remains highly uncertain. It is therefore difficult for the Company to estimate the negative impact on our ability to deliver products during the remainder of 2021.
 
Customers
 
Our target end customer is the middle and upper middle-income consumer of residential and commercial furniture. In the U.S. and international markets, our sales principally are to furniture distributors and retailers who in turn offer our products under their own brands or under our Diamond Sofa brand. We had no customer in 2020 accounted for greater than 10% of our total sales from our continuing operations in 2020. Our largest customers in 2019 accounted for 53.6% of our total sales from our continuing operations in 2019. Once the COVID-19 outbreak dissipates we plan to increase direct sales to retailers and chain stores worldwide as we continue to diversify our customer base from global furniture distributors.

We are focusing on establishing and growing long-term relationships with our customers. We believe that the majority of our customers view us as a strategic long-term supplier and value the quality of our products, our timely delivery and design capabilities. We generally negotiate renewable supplier agreements with firm pricing on our products, typically for a term of one year, as is customary in the furniture industry, with individual orders made on standard purchase orders. In 2020, we sold products into approximately 7 countries worldwide, with North America and Asia as our principal international markets, while we expanded our sales in other regions. Sales to North America accounted for 95.6% and 46.3% of sales from our continuing operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change was attributed principally to our changing sales and marketing strategy to diversify international sales. Sales to other regions, primarily in other Asia countries, accounted for 4.1% and 0% of our total sales from our continuing operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to come from our sales to the U.S. and international markets. Diamond Bar accounted for 95.9% and 46.4% of total sales from our continuing operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and Nova Macao’s revenues accounted for 4.1% and 53.6% of total sales from our continuing operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  In addition, we anticipate increasing internet sales under the Diamond Sofa brand through third-party shopping portals. We believe that as we expand our broad network of distributors and increase direct sales, we will be better positioned to capitalize on emerging market trends.
 
We typically experience stronger fourth calendar quarters as our product sales are subject to the seasonality and fluctuations typical of the furniture industry. This industry-based seasonality is generally caused by shipping lead-times to international markets combined with the real estate market slowdown and decrease in furniture consumption commonly experienced during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere markets in which the majority of our customers are located and our products sell at retail. In addition, we believe that consumer demand for furniture generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including, but not limited to, unemployment rates, housing market conditions and consumer confidence. In view of the expected adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the respective economies of those countries in which we sell our products, and the COVID-19 outbreak-related impact on our supply chains and shipping providers, seasonality and period to period fluctuations in product sales are impossible to predict in 2021. 
 
Competition
 
The furniture industry is large and highly competitive. The industry consists of many manufacturers, distributors and retailers, none of which dominates the fragmented and diverse market. Our products principally compete in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Malaysia and Middle Eastern markets. The primary competitive factors in these markets for our products and target consumers are price, quality, style, marketing, functionality and availability.
 
In the U.S. and international markets, we compete against other furniture distributors and wholesalers which are mostly located in China and other Southeast Asian countries. We also compete against traditional distributors in North America and Europe. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages over North American and European distributors due to our superb customer service and a history of prompt delivery of high quality products. Our contemporary product designs have styles and functionality that are better than, or at least comparable to, those offered by our higher-priced competitors. Our design team closely coordinates with our sales and marketing staff to include customer feedback as part of their ongoing R&D improvement process, thus allows the Company to develop and timely modify products to meet the changing stylistic and functional demands from our worldwide customers. We believe that our decades of product experience and proven performance record offer competitive edges over many other suppliers. In addition to our design and logistical capabilities, we believe that our experience from sourcing custom-made products for distributors presents significant benefits to our customers.
 
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. In the U.S., federal, state and local regulations impose standards on our workplace and our relationship with the environment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations. In particular, we are subject to legislation placing restrictions on our generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and wastes. Such legislation includes: the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also subject to the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, in addition to regulations concerning employee health and safety matters.  We believe the Company has complied with the relevant federal, state, local and international requirements for environmental protection.

Beginning in late 2019, there were reports of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak in Wuhan, China, and the epidemic quickly spread to many provinces, autonomous regions, and cities in China as well as many parts of the world, including the U.S. and Malaysia. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. In response to the evolving dynamics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company has been following the guidelines of local authorities as it prioritizes the health and safety of its employees, contractors, suppliers and retail partners. The Company’s two showrooms and warehouse in Malaysia was closed from March, 2020 to May, 2020.  The Los Angeles facility has been closed since March 16, 2020 and reopened in full operation on June 1, 2020. On May 12, 2020, the Company’s Kuala Lumpur office and warehouse reopened for business. However, on August 28, 2020, Malaysia government extended the shutdown order to all business until March 5, 2021. The third-party contract manufacturers that the Company utilizes in China were closed from the beginning of the Lunar New Year Holiday at the end of January 2020 through the beginning of March 2020. Certain of the Company’s new products are being sourced from manufacturers in India starting in 2020. The factories in India suspended their operations as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic during March through early May 2020. Currently, the factories in India have resumed their operations. Economic activities in Malaysia were reopened on March 5, 2021 through the end of the six-month shutdown order imposed by Malaysia government on August 28, 2020. Shipping of products from Asia has experienced significant delays since the onset of the pandemic and the costs of shipping from Asia have increased since the onset; and we may experience shipping disruptions in the future.  Finally, the Company expects that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the United States and world economies will continue to have a material adverse impact on the demand for its products. Because of the significant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of the business interruption and the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on the patent and trademark protection laws in the U.S. to protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. The Company and our subsidiaries currently hold two trademarks registered in the U.S. related to the “Diamond Sofa” brand. We acquired all rights, title and interest in the two registered U.S. trademarks from St. Joyal at a price of $200,000 (which was paid in full at closing) pursuant to a trademark purchase and assignment agreement dated August 31, 2011. In addition, we have registered and maintained numerous internet domain names related to our business, including “novalifestyle.com” and “diamondsofa.com.”
Research and Development
 
We believe that new product designs are important to our continued success. We actively seek to protect our product designs and brand names under the patent and trademark protection laws in the U.S., but the copying of a product’s appearance is a common and ongoing issue in the furniture industry as manufacturers seek to capitalize on popular designs and features by copying those of their competitors and making subtle changes to avoid infringement claims. To remain competitive, we believe that we must constantly innovate to stay ahead of competitors. We have developed a design process that enables us to better manage the short product life cycles for furniture designs by anticipating and responding quickly to changing consumer preferences. Ordinarily, we strive to attend furniture exhibitions worldwide, conduct market research and solicit customer feedback to help us identify new trends and customer needs in our target markets. We then incorporate customer feedback into new product designs. We normally introduce new product collections annually for the U.S. and international markets. We anticipate introducing new products under the “Diamond Sofa” brand on a quarterly basis for the U.S. market. At least annually, we assess the marketing results for new designs in order to decide whether to continue with a particular line.
 
We use in-house designers and computer-aided modeling systems to generate design and related development work. We have used independent designers in the past for product design, from which we built prototype furniture pieces for refinement and testing. In 2020 and 2019, we invested $33,746 and $132,844, respectively, on research and development expense. We may increase future investments in R&D based on our growth needs.
 
Furniture Industry Regulations and Standards
 
We and our products are subject to PRC, U.S. and international regulations related to the furniture industry.
 
China has a series of national standards, or the GB and QB standards, that govern certain technical, safety and quality requirements for furniture manufactured in and exported from China. The Standardization Administration of the PRC, or SAC, and the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Light Industrial Products and Art-Crafts, or the CCCLA, develop and revise these national standards relating to the structure, material, size and quality requirements for the many varied categories and classifications of upholstered, wood and metal-based furniture. Many of these standards are not compulsory, but manufacturers typically follow all applicable recommended standards.

Our products are also subject to the mandatory and voluntary furniture test standards of the U.S. and international markets in which our products are distributed to end consumers, including those developed by the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer’s Association, or BIFMA, ASTM International, California Air Resources Board, or CARB, Furniture Industry Research Association, or FIRA, and the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. These environmental, ecological and formaldehyde emission standards and source of origin labeling requirements are national or international, with the U.S. and European Union typically having the strictest standards for their markets. We source products from third party manufacturers and we rely on them to meet all local manufacturing standards.
