Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We are an owner and operator of franchised and franchisable businesses that continually looks to grow our portfolio of brands while utilizing our operating and capital allocation philosophies to generate strong cash flows. We have a diversified and growing portfolio of highly recognized brands. Our asset-light business model is designed to generate consistent, recurring revenue and strong operating margins and requires limited maintenance capital expenditures. As a multi-brand operator, we continually look to diversify and grow our portfolio of brands either through acquisition or organic brand development. Our acquisition strategy typically targets businesses that are highly cash flow generative with compelling unit economics that can be scaled by adding franchise and company owned units, or that can be restructured to enhance performance and value to Franchise Group. We strive to create value for our stockholders by generating free cash flow and capital-efficient growth across economic cycles.
Our business lines include The Vitamin Shoppe ("Vitamin Shoppe"), Pet Supplies Plus, Badcock Home Furniture & More ("Badcock"), American Freight, Buddy’s Home Furnishings ("Buddy's"), and Sylvan Learning ("Sylvan"). As of the year ended December 25, 2021, on a combined basis, we operated 2,948 locations consisting of 1,221 franchised locations, 1,410 company run locations, and 317 dealer locations. Each of our companies has its own management team with significant experience in its respective industry. Additionally, we offer our brands a shared services platform that allows us to drive economies of scale, efficiencies, and best practices. We believe our platform enables our portfolio of brands to be stronger together than they are apart. 
We believe our financial performance and business model have been resilient across economic cycles and recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our franchised business model is designed to generate consistent, recurring revenue and predictable free cash flow in order to insulate us from the operating cost variability of our franchised locations. The operating costs of our franchised locations are borne by our franchisees themselves.
We believe our success is driven in large part by our mutually beneficial relationships with our individual franchisees. Our franchise programs are designed to promote consistency and we are selective in granting franchises. We are focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment, capability and capitalization to grow our brands. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one location to publicly-traded companies. 
While the specific terms of our franchise agreements vary between brands, we utilize both store-level franchise and master franchise programs. Under both types of franchise programs, franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land, building, equipment, signs, inventory and supplies. Store-level franchise agreements typically require payment to us of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening a store, fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee. Franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their store sales and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand.
Additionally, one of our subsidiaries offers dealership agreements, whereby a dealer receives a non-exclusive license for use at a designated premises to operate the dealership devoted exclusively to the sale of merchandise and other activities as approved. There are no fees that are paid by the dealer for entering into a dealership agreement. However, the dealers are able to earn and become entitled to receive a commission, as determined by our subsidiary, upon the sale of merchandise consigned by our subsidiary to the dealer.
We seek to maintain healthy relationships with our franchisees, dealers and their representatives. We invest a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements, standards and management techniques.
Our Brands
For further detail on the number of Company-owned stores, dealer-owned stores, franchised stores, and distribution centers operated by each of our brands, refer to Item 2. Properties.
Our Vitamin Shoppe segment is an omnichannel specialty retailer of vitamins, minerals, herbs, specialty supplements, sports nutrition and other health and wellness products. We market approximately 600 nationally recognized brands as well as our own brands, which include The Vitamin Shoppe®, BodyTech®, True Athlete®, plnt®, ProBioCare®, Fitfactor Weight Management System® and Vthrive The Vitamin Shoppe®. We believe we offer one of the largest varieties of products among vitamin, mineral and supplement retailers, and we continue to refine our assortment with approximately 6,800 stock keeping units ("SKUs") offered in our typical store and approximately 4,200 additional SKUs available through e-commerce. Our broad product offering enables us to provide our customers with a depth of selection of products that may not be readily available at other specialty retailers or mass merchants, such as discount stores, supermarkets, drug stores and wholesale clubs. We believe 
our product offering and emphasis on product knowledge and customer service helps us meet the needs of our target customer and serves as a foundation for enhancing strong customer loyalty. We continue to focus on improving the customer experience through the roll-out of initiatives including increasing customer engagement and personalization, redesigning the omnichannel experience (including in stores as well as through the internet and mobile devices), growing our private brands and improving the effectiveness of pricing and promotions. Vitamin Shoppe is headquartered in Secaucus, New Jersey.
Our Pet Supplies Plus segment is a leading omnichannel retail chain and franchisor of pet supplies and services. Pet Supplies Plus has a diversified revenue model comprised of Company-owned store revenue, franchise royalties and revenue generated by the wholesale distribution of products to its franchisees. Pet Supplies Plus offers a curated selection of premium brands, proprietary private labels and specialty products with retail price parity with online players. Additionally, Pet Supplies Plus offers grooming, pet wash and other services in most of its locations. Pet Supplies Plus has developed broad and deep omnichannel capabilities, offering its customers varied cost-competitive shopping options through its convenient neighborhood locations, direct-to-consumer local delivery and buy-online-pickup-in-store model. Pet Supplies Plus is headquartered in Livonia, Michigan.
Our Badcock segment is a specialty retailer of furniture, appliances, bedding, electronics, home office equipment, accessories and seasonal items in a showroom format. Additionally, Badcock offers multiple and flexible payment solutions and credit options through its consumer financing services. We expect Badcock to shift its consumer financing business to third-party vendors in the future. Badcock is headquartered in Mulberry, Florida.
Our American Freight segment is a retail chain offering in-store and online access to furniture, mattresses, new and out-of-box home appliances and home accessories at discount prices. American Freight buys direct from manufacturers and sells direct in warehouse-style stores. By cutting out the middleman and keeping its overhead costs low, American Freight can offer quality products at low prices. American Freight provides customers with multiple payment options providing access to high-quality products and brand name appliances that may otherwise remain aspirational to some of its customers. 
American Freight also serves as a liquidation channel for major appliance vendors. American Freight operates specialty distribution centers that test every out-of-box appliance before it is offered for sale to customers. Customers typically are covered by the original manufacturer's warranty and are offered the opportunity to purchase a full suite of extended-service plans and services. American Freight is headquartered in Delaware, Ohio.
Our Buddy's segment is a specialty retailer of high quality, name brand consumer electronic, residential furniture, appliances and household accessories through rent-to-own agreements. The rental transaction allows our customers the opportunity to benefit from the use of high-quality products under flexible rental purchase agreements without long-term obligations. Buddy's is headquartered in Orlando, Florida.
Our Sylvan Learning segment is an established and growing franchisor of supplemental education for Pre-K-12 students and families in the U.S. and Canada. Sylvan addresses the full range of student needs with a broad variety of academic curriculums delivered in an omnichannel format. The Sylvan platform provides franchisees with the ability to provide a range of services, including on premises, virtually, at a satellite location, and in the home. Sylvan is headquartered in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
On February 21, 2021 we entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to sell our Liberty Tax Service ("Liberty Tax") segment to NextPoint Acquisition Corp ("NextPoint"). On July 2, 2021, we completed the transaction and received total consideration of approximately $255.3 million. The Liberty Tax segment met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations, therefore, we are reporting the historical financial position and results of operations of the Liberty Tax segment as discontinued operations and, as such, the results of operations for Liberty Tax have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. The accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and all prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. Please refer to "Note 3. Discontinued Operations and Assets Disposition" of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. A more complete description of our business prior to our entry into the Purchase Agreement is included in Item 1. "Business" in Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2020 that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 10, 2021.
Regulation
The products and services offered by our business segments are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including but not limited to the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the CFPB, the United States Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. These activities are also regulated by various state, local and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products or services are provided. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Segments” in this Annual Report.
Competition
Each of our brands competes with many well-established companies on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. Vitamin Shoppe competes in the highly competitive nutritional supplements retail industry, in which competition is based primarily on quality, product assortment, price, customer service, convenience, marketing support and availability of new products. American Freight and Badcock primarily compete with discount retailers of furniture and mattresses and with big box retailers and locally-owned appliance retailers that sell new-in-box and liquidations of their out-of-box or as-is appliances. Pet Supplies Plus competes in the highly competitive pet products retail industry, in which competition is based primarily on quality, product assortment, price, customer service, convenience, marketing support and availability of new products. Buddy’s competes with other national, regional and local rent-to-own businesses, including online only competitors, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Sylvan competes with other national, regional and local tutoring centers, including online only competitors.
Business Strategy 
Our strategy is to focus on the operation and acquisition of franchise and franchisable businesses. We strive to assemble a mix of businesses that we believe provide us balance and overall economic resiliency, while also allowing us to benefit from the scale of a single franchising platform.
As a multi-brand operator, we continually look to diversify and grow our portfolio of brands either through acquisition or organic brand development. Our acquisition strategy typically targets businesses that are highly cash flow generative with compelling unit economics that can be scaled by adding franchise and company owned units, or that can be restructured to enhance performance and value to Franchise Group. 
We have established a corporate platform that enables us to deploy capital to acquire assets that may have few natural buyers but become more valuable as part of our Company. Across all businesses, we look to create operating efficiencies in order to drive incremental free cash flow while allowing the management teams of each brand to focus on growing their businesses. Furthermore, our aggregated platform of multiple brands and increased scale provides cost of capital advantages relative to financing each business alone. 
We believe our portfolio of brands will allow us to offer franchisees a variety of platforms that will allow them to diversify their investment portfolio in a local area, optimize their geographic penetration and grow their businesses. We believe our investors will benefit from sustainable franchise royalties and opportunistic franchise sales. Furthermore, we expect our refranchising strategy to create significant cash inflows to opportunistically de-lever and acquire additional brands.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected, and likely will continue to affect, our financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future. In most states, during 2020, our businesses were deemed essential and, therefore, the majority of our stores remained open during the pandemic. The highest number of temporary store closures we experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic was approximately 240 stores during the second quarter of 2020. The spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 had an impact on availability of employees and, in some areas, required us to reduce store hours and in some cases temporarily close stores. We cannot predict when we will be able to restore full store hours or whether our stores will remain open if the COVID-19 pandemic continues or if states and localities will issue new restrictions.
We have not experienced a significant negative impact on our sales and profitability due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our business and financial results by weakening demand for our products and services, interfering with our ability and our franchisees’ ability to operate store locations, disrupting our supply chain or affecting our ability to raise capital from financial institutions. As events are rapidly changing, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations due to uncertainties including, but not limited to, the duration of shutdowns, quarantines and travel restrictions, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak and the public’s response to the outbreak; however, we are actively managing our business to respond to the impact.
Change of Year-End
On October 1, 2019, our Board of Directors (our "Board") approved a change in our fiscal year-end from April 30th to the Saturday in December closest to December 31st of each year. The decision to change the fiscal year-end was related to our recent acquisitions to more closely align our operations and internal controls with that of our subsidiaries. We refer to the period from May 1, 2019 through December 28, 2019, as the "Transition Period" in this report.
On February 22, 2022, our Board approved a change in our fiscal year-end from the Saturday in December closest to December 31st to the Saturday closest to December 31st.
Human Capital Management
General
As of December 25, 2021, we employed 9,119 full-time and 5,551 part-time employees. Part-time employees work an average of fewer than 30 hours per work. The number of part-time employees fluctuates based on seasonal needs. All of our employees are expected to be guided by our values and by an underlying set of ethical principles as incorporated into our Code of Conduct. We believe these values strengthen our culture and our workforce. We strive to demonstrate to our customers, stockholders, business partners, communities and employees that we are worthy of their trust and continually strive to enhance our brand reputation.
The success of our business relies on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. To attract and retain talent, we strive to create an inclusive, diverse and supportive workplace, with opportunities for our employees to develop and grow in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs.
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board (our “NCG Committee”) oversees human capital management activities including the review of management’s strategies, activities, policies and goals with regard to environmental sustainability, climate change, human rights, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and overall human capital management. Our NCG Committee reviews these activities for purposes of risk management, our long term business strategy, and effective communication. Our NCG Committee also has the responsibility to update and make recommendations to our Board on the impact of our human capital management strategies as outlined in its charter, subject to NCG Committee and Board approval.
Corporate Culture
We are focused on creating a corporate culture of integrity and respect, with the goal of working together to drive our business to be innovative and competitive. We operate in a performance-based environment where results matter and financial discipline is enforced. We strive to create a highly collaborative culture in which employees feel that their input is sought after and valued. At the same time, we believe in holding individuals accountable and endeavor to create a culture in which employees do what they say they are going to do. We believe that our culture is a long-term competitive advantage for us, fuels our ability to execute our business strategy and is a critical component of our employee talent strategy. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. Our goal is to cultivate an inclusive environment where human differences are valued, respected, supported and amplified. We have taken actions to recruit, retain, develop and advance a diverse and talented workforce. At the close of fiscal 2020, the representation of women was 20.7% of our total workforce, with increased representation at every level enterprise wide both in technical and executive roles, and our representation of underrepresented minorities was 60.9% overall. At the close of fiscal 2021, the representation of women in executive management was 36.9% across all segments, corporate, and the Board. Further data for fiscal 2021 was not yet available as of the date of filing this Annual Report. We are an equal opportunity employer. We respect diversity and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, sex, gender, gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, veteran status, physical or mental disability, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws. Our management is dedicated to ensuring the fulfillment of this policy with respect to hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff, separation, recruitment, pay and equity, access to facilities and programs, training and general treatment during employment. We invest in attracting, developing and retaining the best talent. We do this by communicating a clear purpose and strategy, transparent goal setting, driving accountability, continuously assessing, developing, advancing talent, and a leadership-driven talent strategy. We also comply with the Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) Commission rules, including making our EEO reports publicly available. Our Vitamin Shoppe segment, as a government contractor, has an affirmative action plan that is updated annually.
Health Safety and Wellness 
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including programs that support their physical and mental health. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, a top priority of the Company has been the health, safety, and well-being of our 
employees and their families. Our management teams continue to monitor, identify and address emerging risks to formulate our response to actions taken by governments and public policy organizations. We base our protocols on guidance from healthcare experts and public health leaders, and regularly review and update them to reflect the best, most current information available.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe and are committed to providing each of our employees a fair wage. We provide competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees. In addition to competitive salaries, these programs include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) plan, health and wellness programs, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
Ethics Hotline
We maintain an Ethics Hotline that is available to all employees to report (anonymously if desired) any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline are routed to appropriate functions (whether Human Resources, Legal or other departments) for investigation and resolution, and in certain instances, such communications may also be escalated, pursuant to our internal policies, to the Audit Committee of our Board for review, investigation and resolution. In addition, any stockholder or other interested party may send communications to us or our Board of Directors through our website.
