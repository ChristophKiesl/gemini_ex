ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and it intends to operate in such a manner. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company and as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and their subsidiaries. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (“KBS Capital Advisors”), our external advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees. 
As of December 31, 2022, we owned one office property, which we sold on March 30, 2023. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 183,346,918 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
On November 13, 2019, in connection with a review of potential strategic alternatives available to us, a special committee composed of all of our independent directors (the “Special Committee”) and our board of directors unanimously approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the plan of complete liquidation and dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation”). The principal purpose of the Plan of Liquidation is to provide liquidity to our stockholders by selling our assets, paying our debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. On March 5, 2020, our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation. The Plan of Liquidation is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Plan of Liquidation
In accordance with the Plan of Liquidation, our objectives are to pursue an orderly liquidation of our company by selling all of our assets, paying our debts and our known liabilities, providing for the payment of unknown or contingent liabilities, distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders and winding up our operations and dissolving our company. 
Pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, our board of directors has authorized five liquidating distributions:

Record Date | Payment Date | Liquidating Distribution Per Share
March 5, 2020 | March 10, 2020 | $ | 0.75
August 3, 2020 | August 7, 2020 | $ | 0.25
December 24, 2020 | December 30, 2020 | $ | 0.40
October 1, 2021 | October 5, 2021 | $ | 0.50
December 9, 2021 | December 14, 2021 | $ | 0.20

We completed the sale of our last remaining real estate property on March 30, 2023. See “—Real Estate” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Subsequent Events.” We anticipate to distribute substantially all of the remaining proceeds from liquidation in the second quarter of 2023. At the time of adopting the Plan of Liquidation, we had anticipated completing the orderly liquidation of our company and paying substantially all of our liquidating distributions from the net proceeds from liquidation within 24 months after stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation, which occurred on March 5, 2020. Given the continued disruptions in the financial markets and continued economic uncertainty, our completion of the Plan of Liquidation has been delayed. Although we were not able to complete our liquidation within the 24-month period described above, we do not anticipate any material unfavorable tax consequences to our stockholders or to our status as a REIT. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) we did not have any current and accumulated earnings and profits (including any gain) or taxable income or gain for the taxable years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and (ii) we do not anticipate any current and accumulated earnings and profits (including any gain) or taxable income or gain in the future.
Our completion of the Plan of Liquidation and the amount of any additional liquidating distributions that we will pay to our stockholders and when we will pay them are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on certain estimates and assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, the actual amount of any additional liquidating distributions we pay to stockholders may be less than we estimate and the liquidating distributions may be paid later than we predict. There are many factors that may affect the amount of liquidating distributions we will ultimately pay to our stockholders. If we underestimate our existing obligations and liabilities or the amount of taxes, transaction fees and expenses relating to the liquidation and dissolution, or if unanticipated or contingent liabilities arise, the amount of liquidating distributions ultimately paid to our stockholders could be less than estimated. We can give no assurance regarding the amount or timing of liquidating distributions to be received by our stockholders.
Real Estate
As of December 31, 2022, we owned one office property located in Los Angeles, California, encompassing in the aggregate 701,888 rentable square feet (“Union Bank Plaza”). As of December 31, 2022, this property was 57% occupied. The estimated liquidation value of this property was $93.5 million, net of deposits received as of December 31, 2022. On March 30, 2023, we completed the sale of Union Bank Plaza for $104.0 million, before third-party closing costs of approximately $1.1 million, inclusive of $10.5 million of non-refundable deposits and excluding disposition fees payable to our advisor. See Part I, Item 2, “Properties” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Subsequent Events.”
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the execution of the Plan of Liquidation and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide any of these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources. 
Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on properties or restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The cost of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
All of our properties were subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired. Some of our properties were subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Human Capital
We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor and its affiliates provide management, advisory and certain administrative services for us.
