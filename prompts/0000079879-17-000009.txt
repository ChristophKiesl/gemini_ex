Strategic Acquisitions
Since the filing of our 2015 Form 10-K, the Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings segments announced and completed several strategic acquisitions, as follows:
Performance Coatings
On January 20, 2017, PPG acquired certain assets of automotive refinish coatings company Futian Xinshi (Futian), based in the Guangdong province of China. Futian distributes its products in China through a network of more than 200 distributors. Futian had sales of approximately $15 million in 2016.
On January 5, 2017, PPG completed the acquisition of DEUTEK S.A., a leading Romanian paint and architectural coatings manufacturer, from the Emerging Europe Accession Fund. DEUTEK, established in 1993, manufactures and markets a large portfolio of well-known professional and consumer paint brands, including OSKAR and Danke!. The company’s products are sold in more than 120 do-it-yourself stores and 3,500 independent retail outlets in Romania. DEUTEK reported sales of 30 million euros in 2015.
On November 11, 2016, PPG purchased the 50% ownership interest in PPG Univer S.p.A from its joint-venture partner, Univer Italiana S.r.l. PPG Univer S.p.A manufactures architectural and liquid industrial coatings employs about 150 people. It operates a network of 12 retail stores in Italy and maintains administrative offices and a production facility in the town of Cavallirio, Italy. PPG Univer S.p.A. had sales of approximately 30 million euros in 2016.
Industrial Coatings
In July 2016, PPG completed the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation. MetoKote is a U.S.-based coatings services business with 2015 global sales of approximately $200 million. MetoKote applies coatings to customers’ manufactured parts and assembled products. It operates on-site coatings services within several customer manufacturing locations, as well as at regional service centers, located throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Customers ship parts to MetoKote service centers where they are treated to enhance paint adhesion and painted with electrocoat, powder or liquid coatings technologies. MetoKote coats an average of more than 1.5 million parts per day. Beginning in July 2016, the financial results of MetoKote are reported as the coatings services operating segment.
Raw Materials and Energy
The effective management of raw materials and energy is important to PPG’s continued success. The Company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins, titanium dioxide and other pigments, and solvents in the coatings businesses; sand and soda ash for the specialty coatings and materials business; and sand and clay in the North American 


10 2016 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K

fiber glass business. Coatings raw materials, which include both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, comprise between 70% and 80% of the Company’s cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, in most coatings formulations and represent PPG’s single largest production cost component. 
Most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. Supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts, multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. Our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. While prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices, such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas. 
The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. These initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations. 
Our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption have been successful to date and are expected to continue. Titanium dioxide is a raw material widely used in the paint and coatings industry as a pigment to provide hiding, durability and whiteness characteristics. PPG purchases both sulfate-grade and chloride-grade titanium dioxide from suppliers for use in coatings formulations. The Company has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance PPG’s supply of titanium dioxide, as well as to minimize PPG’s use of this raw material. PPG possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment. PPG intends to continue to leverage this technology and intends to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations, joint ventures and licensing arrangements with other interested parties. 
PPG signed a license agreement with Henan Billions Chemicals Co., Ltd. (“Billions”), under which PPG has licensed certain chloride-based titanium dioxide technologies for use at Billions’ titanium dioxide refinement facilities in China. In addition, PPG has signed long-term purchase agreements for chloride-grade and sulfate-grade titanium dioxide with Billions. In late 2015, PPG began using chloride-grade titanium dioxide produced by Billions using PPG’s licensed chloride-based technology. PPG’s usage of Billions’ chloride-grade titanium dioxide increased in 2016. PPG is using the chloride-grade titanium dioxide to produce standard grades of coatings products. Under the license agreement, Billions has the right to sell chloride-based titanium dioxide to other parties. 
We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes. Our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards.


Changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the EU and many other countries, including China, Canada, the United States, and Korea. Because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized, the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time. We anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally, and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations.
Given the recent volatility in certain energy-based input costs and foreign currencies, the Company is not able to predict with certainty the 2017 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing; however, PPG currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase modestly in 2017, with impacts varied by region and commodity. Further, given the distribution nature of many of our businesses, logistics and distribution costs are sizable, as are wages and benefits but to a lesser degree. In aggregate, raw material feedstock prices in 2016 were lower, including oil-related products, although some products experienced price inflation late in the year. Since oil is traded in U.S. dollars globally, the strengthening of the dollar against a wide variety of foreign currencies reduced some of the oil-related benefits in certain regions, and in certain cases resulted in inflationary raw material prices.
Research and Development
Technology innovation has been a hallmark of PPG’s success throughout its history. Research and development costs, including depreciation of research facilities, were $487 million, $494 million and $499 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and totaled approximately 3% of annual sales in each year. We have obtained government funding for a small portion of the Company’s research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate.
 PPG owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes. In addition to the Company’s centralized principal research and development centers (See Item 2 of this Form 10-K), operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively, we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in China. Because of the Company’s broad array of products and customers, PPG is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform.
The Company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth. We align our product development with the macro trends in the end-use markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs. Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management.
 Patents 
PPG considers patent protection to be important; however, the Company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. PPG earned $15 million, $20 million and $29 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from royalties and the sale of technical know-how.


2016 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 11

Backlog
 In general, PPG does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders.
Global Operations
PPG has a significant investment in non-U.S. operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on PPG’s total net sales and income from continuing operations. As a result of our expansion outside the U.S., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2016, unfavorable foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately $400 million.
Our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended December 31st are summarized below:

($ in millions) | Net Sales
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
United States, Canada, Western Europe | $ | 10,196 | | | $ | 10,145 | | $ | 10,657
Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific | 4,555 | | | 4,621 | | | 4,134
Total | $ | 14,751 | | | $ | 14,766 | | $ | 14,791

Refer to Note 19, “Reportable Business Segment Information” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for geographic information related to PPG’s property, plant and equipment, and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales. 
Seasonality 
PPG’s income from continuing operations has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to end-use market seasonality, primarily in PPG’s architectural coatings businesses. Demand for PPG’s architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement, maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. The Latin America paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter. These higher activity levels result in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash from operating activities.
Employee Relations
The average number of persons employed worldwide by PPG during 2016 was about 47,000. The Company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world. We observe local customs, laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements. There were no significant work stoppages in 2016. While we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future, we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms. To date, these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on PPG’s results of operations. Overall, the Company believes it has good relationships with its employees. 

Environmental Matters
PPG is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment. PPG is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 126 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations, including 24 sites on the National Priority List. While PPG is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations, each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability. Generally, however, a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site. There is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites, due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation. The Company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 
The Company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites. Management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time.
In addition to the $285 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately $100 million to $200 million. These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant. The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.
Capital expenditures for environmental control projects were $18 million, $15 million and $14 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. It is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2017 will be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. Although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies, it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase.
In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner, is well positioned, relative to environmental matters, within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs.
Public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow, leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions believed to be responsible. While PPG has operations in many countries, a substantial portion of PPG’s 


12 2016 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K

GHG emissions are generated by locations in the U.S., where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place. PPG has, and will continue to, annually report our global GHG emissions to the voluntary Carbon Disclosure project.
Since PPG’s GHG emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels and the purchase of electricity, PPG has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and GHG generation. For the three year period ended December 31, 2016, including the flat glass facilities divested October 1, 2016, energy consumption intensity was reduced by 30% and GHG emission generation intensity was reduced by 22%. 
PPG participates in both the U.S. Department of Energy, BETTER BUILDINGS®, BETTER PLANTS® program, formerly the SAVE ENERGY NOW® Leadership program, and the Environmental Protection Agency ENERGY STAR® Industrial Partnership program, both reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity. These programs include developing and implementing energy management processes and setting energy savings targets while providing a suite of educational, training, and technical resources to help meet those targets. Recognizing the continuing importance of this matter, PPG has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the Company’s progress in this area. 
PPG’s public disclosure on energy security and climate change can be viewed in our Sustainability Report at sustainability.ppg.com or at the Carbon Disclosure Project www.cdp.net.
