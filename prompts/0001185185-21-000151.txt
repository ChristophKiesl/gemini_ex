Description of Business
 
Vado Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 10, 2017 and established a fiscal year end of November 30. We have not generated material revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We were formed to engage in the embroidery business, but in connection with the Change of Control described in the following paragraph, the Company has terminated its plans in the embroidery business and wrote off its assets. Since the Change of Control, we commenced seeking new business opportunities in the United States.
 
On May 22, 2020, David Lelong purchased from Dusan Konc 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company and a convertible promissory note with a face value of $29,973, payable by the Company and convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.001 per share for a total purchase price of $100,000 (the “Change of Control”). The Change of Control was affected pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated May 22, 2020 (the “Purchase Agreement”) by and among Mr. Lelong as the purchaser, the Company, and Mr. Konc, the Company’s then majority shareholder, sole director and officer, as the seller. On May 28, 2020, Mr. Lelong executed the conversion of the Related Party Note into 29,973,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and became the owner of the vast majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
 
The Company currently has no operations and is seeking to acquire a new business in the United States, including potentially by means of a reverse merger with an operating entity. We have not generated revenues since we divested our operating subsidiaries and do not expect to do so in the short-term due to the early stage nature of our Company.
 
The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process, and we have not yet identified a target operating business for acquisition. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the businesses we identify as viable for our objectives, including due to competitive forces in the marketplace beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities for the Company. See Item 1A - Risk Factors.

Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until such time as the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
Regulation
 
As of the date of this Report, we voluntarily file certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
 
Depending on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state level regulation of privacy. Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we do not have employees. However an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer provides part-time consulting services to us as more fully described in “Item 11 Executive Compensation.”
