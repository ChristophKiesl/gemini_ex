Item 1. | Business

We are a leading food and beverage company and the largest processor and direct-to-store distributor of fresh fluid milk and other dairy and dairy case products in the United States.
We manufacture, market and distribute a wide variety of branded and private label dairy and dairy case products, including fluid milk, ice cream, cultured dairy products, creamers, ice cream mix and other dairy products to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, educational institutions and governmental entities across the United States. Our portfolio includes DairyPure®, the country's first and largest fresh, national white milk brand, and TruMoo®, the leading national flavored milk brand, along with well-known regional dairy brands such as Alta Dena®, Berkeley Farms®, Country Fresh®, Dean’s®, Friendly's®, Garelick Farms®, LAND O LAKES® milk and cultured products (licensed brand), Lehigh Valley Dairy Farms®, Mayfield®, McArthur®, Meadow Gold®, Oak Farms®, PET ® (licensed brand), T.G. Lee®, Tuscan® and more. In all, we have more than 50 national, regional and local dairy brands, as well as private labels. We also sell and distribute organic juice, probiotic-infused juices, and fruit-infused waters under the Uncle Matt's Organic® brand. Additionally, we are party to the Organic Valley Fresh joint venture which distributes organic milk under the Organic Valley® brand to retailers. With the completion of our majority interest acquisition of Good Karma Foods, Inc. ("Good Karma") on June 29, 2018, we now sell and distribute flax-based beverages and yogurt products under the Good Karma® brand.  Dean Foods also makes and distributes juices, teas and bottled water. Due to the perishable nature of our products, we deliver the majority of our products directly to our customers’ locations in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. We believe that we have one of the most extensive refrigerated direct-to-store delivery ("DSD") systems in the United States. We sell our products primarily on a local or regional basis through our local and regional sales forces, and in some instances, with the assistance of brokers. Some national customer relationships are coordinated by our centralized corporate sales department.
Unless stated otherwise, any reference to income statement items in this Form 10-K refers to results from continuing operations. Each of the terms "we," "us," "our," "the Company," and "Dean Foods" refers collectively to Dean Foods Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1994, and our principal executive offices are located at 2711 North Haskell Avenue, Suite 3400, Dallas, Texas 75204. Our telephone number is (214) 303-3400, and we maintain a web site at www.deanfoods.com. 
Developments Since January 1, 2019
Leadership Changes — On July 26, 2019, we announced that Eric Beringause will serve as the Company's new President and Chief Executive Officer effective July 29, 2019, replacing Ralph Scozzafava. Mr. Beringause previously served as the Chief Executive Officer of Gehl Foods, LLC from March 2015 to August 2018, as Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Refreshment LLC from 2011 to 2014, and President and Chief Executive Officer of Sturm Foods, Inc. from 2008 to 2011.
On October 25, 2019, we announced that Gary W. Rahlfs will serve as the Company's new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective October 23, 2019. Mr. Rahlfs, 52, had served as the Company's Interim Chief Financial Officer since September 24, 2019, replacing Jody Macedonio. Mr. Rahlfs previously served as the Company's Senior Vice President, Finance & Strategy since May 2019. From March 2018 to May 2019, Mr. Rahlfs served as the Chief Financial Officer/Vice Chancellor for Finance at the University of North Texas. From 1994 until February 2017, Mr. Rahlfs was employed at PepsiCo, Inc., where he held several positions, including Vice President Finance, Global Groups for PepsiCo, Chief Financial Officer – PepsiCo Foods Canada, and Vice President Sales Finance – Frito-Lay US-South Division.
Chapter 11 Proceedings — On November 12, 2019 (the “Petition Date”), we and substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries (other than our Securitization Subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries) (the “Filing Subsidiaries” and, together with the Company, the “debtors-in-possession”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (collectively, the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The debtors-in-possession’s Chapter 11 cases (collectively, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) are being jointly administered under the caption In re Southern Foods Group, LLC, Case No. 19-36313. Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the debtors-in-possession have continued to operate their business as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
The filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the documents governing the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, the Receivables Securitization Facility and our 2023 Notes (collectively, the “Debt Instruments”) and substantially all of our other indebtedness.
Since the Petition Date, the debtors-in-possession have requested and received certain approvals and authorizations from the Bankruptcy Court. This relief provided the debtors-in-possession authority to make payments upon, or otherwise honor, certain prepetition obligations (e.g., obligations related to certain employee wages, salaries and benefits and certain vendors and other providers essential to the debtors-in-possession’s businesses).
Going Concern — As a result of extremely challenging current market conditions, continuing losses from operations, our current financial condition and the resulting risks and uncertainties surrounding our Chapter 11 proceedings, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of issuance of these financial statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to become profitable, maintain profitability and successfully implement our Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and/or any sale of all or substantially all of our assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the Bankruptcy Petitions, the realization of the debtors-in-possession’s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities are subject to significant uncertainty. While operating as debtors-in-possession pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we may sell or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets, or settle liabilities, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or as otherwise permitted in the ordinary course of business for amounts other than those reflected under “Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Form 10-K. Further, a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is likely to materially change the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities reported under “Part II - Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Form 10-K. As the progress of these plans and transactions is subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court and therefore not within our control, successful reorganization and emergence from bankruptcy cannot be considered probable and such plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Delisting of our Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") — Our common stock was previously listed on the NYSE under the symbol “DF.” On November 12, 2019, the NYSE suspended trading in our common stock at the market opening and we received written notice from the NYSE that it had determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock because we are no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Listed Company Manual Section 802.01D following the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions. The delisting became effective on November 27, 2019. Since November 13, 2019, our common stock has been quoted on the Pink Open Market maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “DFODQ.” We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on this market, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on this market, whether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for our common stock will continue on this market in the future.
Debtors-in-Possession Financing — In connection with the Bankruptcy Petitions, on November 14, 2019, we entered into a Senior Secured Superpriority Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the “DIP Credit Agreement”), among us, as borrower, 
the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “DIP Lenders”) and Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the DIP Lenders (in such capacities, the “DIP Agent”). The DIP Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured superpriority debtor-in-possession credit facility (the “DIP Facility”) consisting of (i) a new money revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $236.2 million, in the form of revolving loans (the “DIP Revolving Loans”) or, subject to a sub-limit of $25 million, the form of letters of credit (the “DIP Letters of Credit”) and (ii) term loans (the “DIP Term Loans” and, together with the DIP Revolving Loans, the “DIP Loans”) refinancing the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as of the Petition Date. Our obligations under the DIP Facility are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are debtors-in-possession in the Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, the claims of the DIP Lenders are (i) entitled to superpriority administrative expense claim status and, subject to certain customary exclusions in the credit documentation, and (ii) secured by (x) a perfected first priority lien on all property of the debtors-in-possession not subject to valid, perfected and non-avoidable liens in existence on the Petition Date, (y) a perfected first priority priming lien on collateral under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and (z) a perfected junior lien on all property of the debtors-in-possession and the proceeds thereof that are subject to valid, perfected and non-avoidable liens in existence on the Petition Date or valid and non-avoidable liens in existence on the Petition Date that are perfected subsequent to the Petition Date to the extent permitted by Section 546(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, in each case subject to a carve-out for the debtors-in-possession’s professional fees and certain liens permitted by the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement. 
In connection with the Bankruptcy Petitions, on November 14, 2019, we also reached agreement with the lenders under our Receivables Securitization Facility to amend and restate certain agreements governing our Receivables Securitization Facility to, among other things, (i) modify certain covenants, representations, events of default and cross defaults arising as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) modify the other rights and obligations of the parties to the facility in order to give effect to, and in certain instances be subject to, orders of the Bankruptcy Court from time to time, (iii) reduce the total size of the facility to $425 million, with a corresponding reduction to availability thereunder, (iv) after giving effect to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, ensure that the facility continues in effect (as amended) and liquidity continues to be available during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, subject to the terms and conditions therein and subject to the orders of the Bankruptcy Court, (v) modify certain pricing terms and fees payable under the facility and (vi) make certain other amendments, including in order to give effect to future issuances of letters of credit and to issue a letter of credit thereunder to backstop all of our letters of credit issued and outstanding under the facility in order to, among other things, help ensure that such letters of credit remain in effect to secure our obligations owed to the beneficiaries thereunder.
The Bankruptcy Court entered orders approving the DIP Credit Agreement and amended Receivables Securitization Facility, on an interim basis, on November 14, 2019. Final orders approving the DIP Credit Agreement and the amended Receivables Securitization Facility were entered by the Bankruptcy Court on December 23, 2019.
Key Employee Retention Program (the “KERP”) — In order to enhance the Company’s ability to attract, retain and incentivize the employees necessary to maximize the value of the business during its restructuring, on January 17, 2020, on the recommendation of its compensation advisors, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $7.13 million Key Employee Retention Program (the “KERP”). The KERP was subsequently approved by the Bankruptcy Court on February 19, 2020. 
The KERP provides for retention awards to certain key employees with high business impact and retention risk as well as a discretionary pool from which the Company’s President and CEO may make awards in connection with new hires, promotions and job changes. Awards made under the KERP are intended to replace the Company’s long-term incentive award program and prepetition retention awards that are not continuing through the Company’s restructuring. The award recipient must execute a waiver of any long-term incentive opportunity for 2020 in order to receive a retention award. KERP awards will be paid in cash at the earlier of (i) one year following the Bankruptcy Court approval date, (ii) the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all the assets, or (iii) the effective date of an emergence from bankruptcy, subject to the continued employment of the KERP participant; however, if the KERP participant’s employment is terminated without cause, the participant remains eligible for payment of the award. 
Asset Sale — On February 16, 2020, we, and certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, the “Sellers”), agreed to enter into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., a cooperative organized and existing under the laws of the State of Kansas (“DFA” or “Buyer”), pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions described below, DFA agreed to purchase certain assets (the “Asset Sale”) from the Sellers. The assets to be acquired pursuant to the APA included 44 of the debtors-in-possession’s 56 fluid and frozen facilities (the “Acquired Facilities”), plus certain related real estate, inventory, equipment, assigned contracts, permits and other assets necessary to operate such facilities and certain other real estate and assets as set forth in the APA (together with the Acquired Facilities, the “Bid Assets”). In connection with the proposed execution of the APA, the debtors-in-possession initially sought authorization from the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases to enter into the APA and the Asset Sale with DFA. On March 19, 2020, the Sellers and DFA mutually agreed to terminate the APA and withdraw the request for authorization from the Bankruptcy Court of the Asset Sale and for approval of DFA as a “stalking horse” bidder of
 the Assets. Notwithstanding the termination of the APA, DFA has indicated to us that it will submit a bid for the Bid Assets before the court-imposed deadline described below, but DFA is under no obligation to do so. 
On March 18, 2020, the debtors-in-possession filed notice with the Bankruptcy Court of the termination of the APA, while seeking approval of proposed bidding procedures with respect to the sale of the Bid Assets (the “Bidding Procedures”), and on March 19, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing with respect to the proposed Bidding Procedures. At this hearing, the parties obtained an order of the Bankruptcy Court (the "Bidding Procedures Order") approving the revised Bidding Procedures.
Pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order, the debtors-in-possession intend to sell all of their right, title and interest in and to the Bid Assets free and clear of any pledges, liens, security interests, encumbrances, claims, charges, options, and interests thereon (collectively, the “Interests”) to the maximum extent permitted by section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, with such Interests to attach to the net proceeds of the sale of the Bid Assets with the same validity and priority as such Interests applied against the Bid Assets. The deadline for the submission of bids that satisfy the requirements of the Bidding Procedures Order (each a “Bid,” and those parties who submit a Bid, each a “Bidder”) is March 30, 2020 at 12:00 p.m. (prevailing Central Time) (the “Bid Deadline”).
Immediately following the Bid Deadline, the debtors-in-possession shall, in consultation with the Consultation Parties, (i) review and evaluate each Bid on the basis of financial and contractual terms and other factors relevant to the sale process, including those factors affecting the speed and certainty of consummating the Sale, (ii) determine and identify the highest or otherwise best offer or collection of offers (the “Successful Bid(s)”) and (iii) determine and identify the second best offer or collection of offers (the “Alternate Bid(s)”). The deadline to object to the Successful Bid(s) will be April 1, 2020 at 12:00 p.m. (prevailing Central Time). Following selection of the Successful Bid(s), the debtors-in-possession may, in their discretion, elect to seek approval of the transactions contemplated in the Successful Bid(s) at the hearing to consider and approve the proposed Sale Order (the “Sale Hearing”).
The Sale Hearing is proposed to be held on April 3, 2020 at 9:00 a.m. (prevailing Central time) before the Bankruptcy Court. The Sale Hearing may be adjourned by the debtors-in-possession, in consultation with the Consultation Parties, by an announcement of the adjourned date at a hearing before the Bankruptcy Court or by filing a notice on the Bankruptcy Court’s docket. At the Sale Hearing, the debtors-in-possession will seek the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of the Successful Bid(s) and/or, at the debtors-in-possession’s election, the Alternate Bid(s). 
The Acquired Facilities plus certain related real estate and equipment in the APA are reported as property, plant and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because the Bankruptcy Court has not authorized and approved the Asset Sale, these assets have not been reclassified under ASC 852 to assets held for sale.
Overview
We manufacture, market and distribute a wide variety of branded and private label dairy and dairy case products, including fluid milk, ice cream, cultured dairy products, creamers, ice cream mix and other dairy products to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, educational institutions and governmental entities across the United States. Our consolidated net sales totaled $7.3 billion in 2019. The following charts depict our 2019 net sales, excluding sales of excess raw materials of $380.3 million and sales of other bulk commodities of $127.5 million, by product and product sales mix between company branded versus private label.

Our largest customer is Walmart Inc., including its subsidiaries such as Sam’s Club, which accounted for approximately 15.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We currently operate 56 manufacturing facilities in 29 states located largely based on customer needs and other market factors, with distribution capabilities across all 50 states. For more information about our facilities, see “Item 2. Properties.” Due to the perishable nature of our products, we deliver the majority of our products directly to our customers’ locations in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a “direct-to-store delivery” or “DSD” system. We believe that we have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States.
The primary raw material used in our products is conventional raw milk (which contains both raw skim milk and butterfat) that we purchase primarily from farmers’ cooperatives, as well as from independent farmers. The federal government and certain state governments set minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat on a monthly basis. Another significant raw material we use is resin, which is a fossil fuel-based product used to make plastic bottles. The price of resin fluctuates based on changes in crude oil and natural gas prices. Other raw materials and commodities used by us include diesel fuel, used to operate our extensive DSD system, and juice concentrates and sweeteners used in our products. We generally increase or decrease the prices of our private label fluid dairy products on a monthly basis in correlation with fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, packaging supplies and delivery costs. We manage the pricing of our branded fluid milk products on a longer-term basis, balancing consumer demand with net price realization but, in some cases, we are subject to the terms of sales agreements with respect to the means and/or timing of price increases.
We have several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf-space with retailers is based primarily on price, service, quality and the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors’ products. In some cases we pay fees to customers for shelf-space. Competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as price, taste preference, quality and brand recognition. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Additionally, we face competitive pressures from vertically integrated retailers, discount supermarket chains, dairy cooperatives and other processors, and online and delivery grocery retailers.

The fluid milk category enjoys a number of attractive attributes. This category’s size and pervasiveness, plus the limited shelf life of the product, make it an important category for retailers and consumers, as well as a large long-term opportunity for the best positioned dairy processors. However, the dairy industry is not without some well documented challenges. It is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized as highly competitive and subject to commodity volatility, with low profit margins. Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), consumption of fluid milk continues to decline. 
 For more information on factors that could impact our business, see “— Government Regulation — Milk Industry Regulation” and “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Known Trends and Uncertainties — Conventional Raw Milk and Other Inputs.” See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for segment, geographic and customer information.
Current Business Strategy
Dean Foods has evolved over the past 20 years through periods of rapid acquisition, consolidation, integration and the separation of our operations including the spin-off of The WhiteWave Foods Company ("WhiteWave") and sale of Morningstar Foods ("Morningstar") in 2013. Today, we are a leading food and beverage company and the largest processor and direct-to-store distributor of fresh fluid milk and other dairy and dairy case products in the United States. 
Our vision is to be the most admired and trusted provider of wholesome, great-tasting dairy products at every occasion. Our strategy is to invest and grow our portfolio of brands while strengthening our operations and capabilities to achieve a more profitable core business. Our strategy is anchored by our commitments to safety, quality and service, and delivering sustainable profit growth and total shareholder return.
Corporate Responsibility
Within our business strategies, corporate responsibility remains an integral part of our efforts. As we work to strengthen our business, we are committed to do it in a way that is right for our employees, shareholders, consumers, customers, suppliers and the environment. We intend to realize savings by reducing waste and duplication while we continue to support programs that improve our local communities. We believe that our customers, consumers and suppliers value our efforts to operate in an ethical, environmentally sustainable, and socially responsible manner.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonal changes in the demand for dairy products. Sales volumes are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to increased dairy consumption during seasonal holidays. Fluid milk volumes tend to decrease in the second and third quarters of the year primarily due to the reduction in dairy consumption associated with our school customers, partially offset by the increase in ice cream and ice cream mix consumption during the summer months. Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed, fluctuations in volumes and revenue from quarter to quarter may have a material effect on operating income for the respective quarters. 
Intellectual Property
We are continually developing new technology and enhancing existing proprietary technology related to our dairy operations. Seven U.S. and eight international patents have been issued to us, two U.S. patents have been allowed, and three U.S. and five international patent applications are pending. Our U.S. patents are expected to expire at various dates between February 2019 and December 2035. If the pending U.S. patent applications are granted, those patents would be expected to expire at various dates between June 2035 and October 2037. Our international patents are expected to expire at various dates between February 2028 and March 2030. If the pending international patent applications are granted, those patents would be expected to expire in September 2037. 
We primarily rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. Despite these protections, it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy, obtain or use certain portions of our proprietary technology or trademarks. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 14,500 employees. Approximately 39% of our employees participate in a multitude of collective bargaining agreements of varying duration and terms.
Government Regulation
Food-Related Regulations
As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food-related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA:

• | regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations;


• | specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell; and


• | prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels.

 We are also subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which, among other things, mandates the FDA to adopt preventative controls to be implemented by food facilities in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorizes regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products.
We use quality control laboratories in our manufacturing facilities to test raw ingredients. In addition, all of our facilities have achieved Safety Quality Food ("SQF") Level 3 under the Global Food Safety Initiative. Product quality and freshness are essential to the successful distribution of our products. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We believe our facilities and manufacturing practices are in material compliance with all government regulations applicable to our business.
Employee Safety Regulations
We are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various state and federal environmental laws, regulations and directives, including the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. Our plants use a number of chemicals that are considered to be “extremely” hazardous substances pursuant to applicable environmental laws due to their toxicity, including ammonia, which is used extensively in our operations as a refrigerant. Such chemicals must be handled in accordance with such environmental laws. Also, on occasion, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities in excess of levels allowed under local regulations. As a result, certain of our facilities are required to pay wastewater surcharges or to construct wastewater pretreatment facilities. To date, such wastewater surcharges and construction costs have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We maintain above-ground and under-ground petroleum storage tanks at many of our facilities. We periodically inspect these tanks to determine whether they are in compliance with applicable regulations and, as a result of such inspections, we are required to make expenditures from time to time to ensure that these tanks remain in compliance. In addition, upon removal of the tanks, we are sometimes required to make expenditures to restore the site in accordance with applicable environmental laws. To date, such expenditures have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We believe that we are in material compliance with the environmental regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect the cost of our continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows or competitive position in the foreseeable future. In addition, any asset retirement obligations are not material.
Milk Industry Regulation
The federal government establishes minimum prices that we must pay to producers in federally regulated areas for raw milk. Raw milk primarily contains raw skim milk in addition to a small percentage of butterfat. Raw milk delivered to our facilities is tested to determine the percentage of butterfat and other milk components, and we pay our suppliers for the raw milk based on the results of these tests.
The federal government’s minimum prices for Class I milk vary depending on the processor’s geographic location or sales area and the type of product manufactured. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into Class I products such as fluid milk) and Class II raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into Class II products such as cottage cheese, creams, creamers, ice cream and sour cream) for each month are announced by the federal government the immediately preceding month. Class II butterfat prices are announced either at the end of the month or the first week of the following month in which the price is effective. Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices for raw milk. In addition to the federal or state minimum prices, we also may pay producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and supplier.
Labeling Regulations
We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal, state and local levels. At the federal level, the FDA has authority to review product labeling, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) may review labeling and advertising materials including online and television advertisements, to determine if advertising materials are misleading. Similarly, many states review dairy product labels to determine whether they comply with applicable state laws. We believe we are in material compliance with all labeling laws and regulations applicable to our business.
We are also subject to various state and local consumer protection laws.
