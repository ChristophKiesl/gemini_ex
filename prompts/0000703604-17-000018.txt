ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Lawson Products, Inc. (“Lawson”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) was incorporated in Illinois in 1952, and reincorporated in Delaware in 1982. Lawson serves the industrial, commercial, institutional and government Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") market. 
Vision
Our vision is to be our customers' first choice for maintenance, repair and operational solutions that improve their operating performance. We plan to achieve our vision by working closely with our customers to maintain and enhance their operations by providing them with quality products, superior service and innovative solutions. 
Industry and Competition
The MRO industrial distribution industry is comprised of companies that buy and stock products in bulk and supply these products to customers on an as needed basis. The customer benefits from our knowledge and the convenience of ordering smaller quantities maintained by MRO suppliers. We estimate that total annual revenue generated by the North American MRO marketplace exceeds $130 billion. 
There is a significant amount of competitive fragmentation by geography and product within the industry. We encounter competition from several national distributors and manufacturers and a large number of regional and local distributors. Some competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, handle more extensive lines of merchandise, operate larger facilities and price some merchandise more competitively than we do. 
We deliver quality products to our customers and offer them extensive product knowledge, product application expertise and Vendor Managed Inventory ("VMI") services. Our broad geographic sales coverage allows us to serve large multi-location customers. We compete for business primarily by offering a value-added service approach in which our highly trained sales representatives manage the product inventory for our customers. The VMI model makes it less likely that our customers will unintentionally run out of a product while optimizing their inventory levels. 
Customers
During 2016, we sold products to over 70,000 customers with the largest customer accounting for approximately two percent of net sales. In 2016, approximately 91% of our net sales were generated in the United States and approximately 9% in Canada. Our customers operate in a variety of industries including automotive repair, commercial vehicle maintenance, government, manufacturing, food processing, distribution, construction, oil and gas, mining, wholesale, service and others. Although seasonality is not significant in our business, due to fewer selling days during the holiday season, net sales in the fourth quarter are historically slightly lower than the first three quarters of the year.
Our customers include a wide range of purchasers of industrial supply products from small repair shops to large national and governmental accounts. Historically, we have been very effective selling to and servicing small and medium sized customer locations that value our service approach. 
Operations
Sales orders are primarily generated from our sales representatives; however, customers can also order directly from our website or through our customer service team via fax or phone. We ship products to customers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. We normally ship to our customers within one day of order placement. 
Our MRO distribution process normally entails the purchase of product from suppliers in bulk for delivery to our packaging and distribution facility in McCook, Illinois (“McCook Facility”) for possible repackaging, labeling or cross-docking. Product is then either stocked at the McCook Facility or delivered to one of our strategically located distribution centers. As orders are received, product is picked, packed and shipped to our customers. Many factors affect the efficiency of this process including the physical design of the distribution centers, routing logistics, the number of times the product needs to be handled, transportation costs and the flexibility to meet the specific requirements of our customers.

Products
Our product offerings are listed on our website and in catalogs distributed to our customers. Sales percentages by broad product categories of our product mix in 2016 were as follows:

Product Category | Percentage
Fastening systems | 21% 
Specialty chemicals | 15% 
Fluid power | 15% 
Cutting tools and abrasives | 15% 
Electrical | 12% 
Aftermarket automotive supplies | 9% 
Safety | 4% 
Welding and metal repair | 2% 
Other | 7% 
 | 100% 

We offer over 200,000 different core products for sale of which over 50,000 products are maintained in our distribution centers. We strive to carry sufficient inventory to ensure product availability and rapid processing of customer orders. Accurate forecasting of customer demand is essential to establish the proper level of inventory for each product. Inventory levels need to be sufficient to meet customer demand while avoiding the costs of stocking excess items. 
During 2016, we purchased products from approximately 2,300 suppliers and no single supplier accounted for more than five percent of our purchases. The loss of one of our core suppliers could affect our operations by hindering our ability to provide full service to our customers.
Our quality control department tests our product offerings to ensure they meet our customers' specifications. We recommend solutions to help customers maximize product performance and avoid costly product failures. Our engineering department provides technical support for our products and offers on-site problem solutions. They also develop and present product safety and technical training seminars tailored to meet our customers' needs. Safety Data Sheets are maintained electronically and are available to our customers on our website. 
Employees 
Our organization supports a culture of continuous improvement and emphasizes the importance of addressing the needs of our customers. We require our employees to act with integrity in every aspect of our business while encouraging them to be results driven, team oriented and progressive. 
On December 31, 2016, our workforce included approximately 1,590 individuals, comprised of approximately 1,130 in sales and marketing, approximately 390 in operations and distribution and approximately 70 in management and administration. Approximately 10% of our workforce is covered by three collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and their collective bargaining organizations are good. 
Sales Team
On December 31, 2016, our sales and marketing team consisted of approximately 1,130 individuals focused on servicing existing customers, identifying new customers, providing customer service support and providing on-site customer service. Of our total sales team, 1,009 are sales representatives who are primarily organized into geographical regions. The performance of each region is the responsibility of a Regional Sales Director. Each region is further divided into geographically defined districts. The performance of each district is the responsibility of a District Sales Manager who reports to the Regional Sales Director. Our District Sales Managers work with the sales representatives to generate sales from new and existing customers. We also have a team dedicated to the acquisition of larger national and mid-market accounts and a team dedicated to serving our governmental accounts. The national accounts are comprised of multi-location customers with a national scope.

Our sales team receives education in the best uses of our products, enabling them to provide customized solutions to address our customers' needs including technical expertise and on-site problem resolution. The VMI service we offer consists of managing our customers' inventory, ordering the right products in the optimal quantity and stocking the product for our customer when the product is delivered. The sales team also periodically provides product presentations to our customers that are designed to demonstrate how our products can improve their productivity. Additionally, we offer customized storage systems for improved organization and a more efficient work-flow. 
Strategic Focus
In 2017, our focus will be to continue to grow our sales organically and through acquisitions and further improve our operations to make Lawson our customers' first choice for products, services and solutions that improve their operating performance. 
Our sales are directly affected by the size of our sales team and its territorial coverage. In 2016, we increased our sales team by 72 sales representatives and we plan to continue to expand our sales representative count during 2017. Our plan to expand the sales force is designed to identify under served territories that offer the greatest potential growth opportunity, locate and recruit talented sales representatives, provide them with the proper training, and successfully integrate them into our organization.
To acquire the best new sales talent and prepare them for success, we have developed an extensive talent acquisition strategy. We use both internal and external resources to identify and recruit the best available sales talent. Our exclusive training program is intended to provide new sales representatives with the tools they need to maximize their sales potential. As we increase our sales coverage, we anticipate a short-term decrease in average sales per day per sales representative, as new representatives build up customer relationships in their territories. Our 2017 financial results may also be impacted by increased training and other costs related to the sales force expansion. However, we believe that these short-term investments will result in future opportunities as we leverage the impact of top-line growth over our fixed operating costs.
We are also focused on increasing the productivity of our sales representatives. We strive to empower our sales representatives with the training, technology and support they need to maximize their sales potential while providing our customers with superior service and making it easy for them to do business with us. In addition to organic growth, we will continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities which fit our service oriented MRO business model and are financially accretive to our organization.
In order to improve our operations, we utilize a Lean Six Sigma approach, which is a set of tools that allow a project team to analyze and improve selected business processes. The project teams work with the process owners to develop statistical measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the process, document the current components and process flow, examine the root cause and effect of current operations, design and implement new ways to improve performance and then measure the results for effectiveness. The Lean Six Sigma process is deeply ingrained in our culture as we have had well over 100 employees complete Lean Six Sigma training over the past three years and plan to continue this training program in the years to come. In 2017, we plan to complete some of the projects initiated in 2016 that are focused on improving the operations of our sales force and we have initiated additional Lean Six Sigma projects involving customer data and customer retention processes. 
We believe our emphasis on continuous improvement will lead to further reductions in error rates, increased processing speed, reduction in cycle times, standardization of procedures and elimination of waste. This will enable us to become a more efficient and effective organization while providing our customers with the best purchasing experience possible.
