ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History
 
We were formed in Delaware on June 26, 1972 as OCR Corporation, underwent a series of name changes and businesses and on April 25, 2008 changed our name to Texas Wyoming Drilling, Inc. On January 26, 2016, we entered into an Equity Exchange Agreement (the “EEA”) whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Drone USA, LLC in exchange for 440,425,388 shares of our common stock and 250 shares of Series A preferred stock, subsequent and pursuant to our completing a 1-for-150 share reverse stock split on all issued and outstanding common stock which resulted in total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of 6,368,224 immediately prior to this issuance. In connection with the EEA, 1,253,202 shares of common stock were relinquished and an additional 44,042,539 shares of common stock were issued pursuant to a previous settlement agreement. In connection with the EEA, effective January 26, 2016, we accepted the resignation of Margaret Cadena, the former Chief Executive Officer and Board member, and Richard Kugelman, Dr. Robert Michet, and Dr. David Durkin, the remaining former officers and Board members, and appointed Michael Bannon as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman and Board member and Dennis Antonelos as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and Board member. Dennis Antonelos resigned as our CFO and as a member of our Board on July 10, 2017 and Michael Bannon was appointed as CFO. On May 19, 2016, we changed our name to Drone USA, Inc., we changed our ticker symbol to DRUS, and we completed a 1-for-12 share reverse stock split on all issued and outstanding common stock, with a record date of May 24, 2016, which resulted in total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of 40,841,517 on June 17, 2016 when all round lot issuances were completed.
 
We are currently traded on the OTCQB market under the symbol DRUS.
 
On June 1, 2016, we entered into an agreement with BRVANT Technologic Solutions ("BRVANT"), a company in Brazil that develops and manufactures UAV systems, embedded systems and simulators for commercial and military customers. We acquired exclusive rights to BRVANT's UAV technology and intellectual property relating to its UAV technology. As consideration for the agreement, Dr. Rodrigo Kuntz Rangel, BRVANT’s CEO, was appointed to the position of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and issued a stock option grant for 2,000,000 shares of common stock in Drone USA. We have the option to acquire ownership of all outstanding capital stock of BRVANT for additional consideration of $1 million, but we have not made a decision to make that purchase at this time. The agreement with BRVANT provided the Company a turnkey line card of proven, advanced low-altitude UAVs to begin selling immediately.
 
On August 18, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Rockwell Capital Partners, Inc. (“Rockwell”) in connection with a section 3(a)(10) transaction under the Securities Act where we issued to Rockwell a convertible note in the principal amount of $102,102.74. To limit the number of our shares that Rockwell would have to sell and thus limit the potential pressure on the trading price of our common stock, in August 2016 we issued 68,500 shares to Rockwell, of which 11,500 were a settlement fee and the balance were for repayment of $58,165 of the convertible note, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 issued an additional 460,200 shares for the remaining note balance as part of the Settlement Agreement for a total of 528,700 shares issued to Rockwell.
 
In September 2016, we entered into an agreement with the Portuguese Government (Secretaria do Mar, Ciência e Tecnologia –“SMCT”), the national aviation authority of Portugal (Navegação Aérea de Portugal – “NAV”) and Aeroportos de Portugal (airports’ management authority – “ANA”) enabling us to fly and test UAVs at the Portugese airport of Santa Maria Island, in the Azores archipelago. The agreement is for five years and will automatically renew unless written notification is provided by one of the parties within 180 days of the renewal date. We are one of five companies to have such access, and the only non-Portuguese company to have such access. We will test and develop UAVs for operations over land and sea but have not yet tested any UAVs in Portugal. We further expect to assist the Azores Regional Government over the coming years that is expected to have a growing demand for UAV technology for environmental monitoring at sea, fisheries control and scientific research, including for climate change.

In September 2016, Drone USA registered with the U.S. State Department and met the requirements of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"). The registration allows us to apply for export, and temporary import, of product, technical data, and services related to defense articles.
 
On September 9, 2016, Howco became a wholly owned subsidiary of Drone USA. We acquired all of its issued and outstanding shares held by Paul Charles ("Chuck") Joy and Kathryn B. Joy, the founders and officers of Howco, for $3,500,000, a warrant for 500,000 shares of Drone USA common stock with an exercise price of $0.01 per share, and earnout consideration, the funds for which were received from the TCA loan discussed below. We paid $2,600,000 in cash and issued a note to the sellers for $900,000. Howco is a supplier of spare and replacement parts to the United States Federal Government and commercial customers worldwide with expertise in Defense Logistics Agency, TACOM, NECO and other Department of Defense acquisition groups. Howco understands the entire contract and administration management process for Federal Government contracts and supply chain logistics for its Federal Government customers as well as prime contractors with Federal Government contracts. Chuck Joy and Kathryn Joy have been retained under contract for a term of two years, a salary of $125,000 and a tiered bonus-structure that is dependent on the gross margin performance of Howco in the subsequent 12 and 24 month periods immediately following the acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Howco reported revenues of approximately $18.78 million and $24.86 million, and net income of approximately $903,000 and $1,013,000, for the period from October 1, 2015 through September 9, 2016 and the year ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2017, three customers accounted for approximately 65%, 12% and 11% of Howco’s total sales. The customers are the Defense Logistics Agency-Columbus, Defense Logistics Agency-Richmond and the Defense Logistics Agency-Philadelphia, respectively. Howco’s dependence on three significant customers, all part of the Federal Government, is a risk for its ability to maintain or increase its future revenues since the loss of one or both could have significant adverse financial consequences for Howco and Drone USA.
 
On November 17, 2016, we entered into a sublease with ESAero for a period of two years commencing February 1, 2017, of office space and engineering design space of approximately 10,000 square feet at a monthly cost of $15,000. The sublease is at 3580 Sueldo Street, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401. We have not made any lease payments since inception of this sublease and do not intend to use this facility since it was based, in large part, on the relationship that we had with a former employee, Paulo Ferro, with whom we are now in litigation following our termination of him. We could be found to be in default of our obligations under the lease and have accrued on our financial statements all $360,000 that we would owe under the lease through its full term.
 
In November 2016, we demonstrated our quadcopter system for a NATO member country and have submitted a proposal for 600 Shadow quadcopter systems, priced at approximately $40,000 per system, totaling $24 million. This NATO member country plans to use the quadcopters for ISR purposes. We were not awarded the contract but were encouraged by this NATO company representatives to submit proposals for the second and third tranches of this order in 2018 and 2019, respectively, where each tranche is expected to equal or exceed the magnitude of the first tranche.
 
In December 2016, we reached a verbal agreement to integrate a leading camera and software application into our precision agriculture platform that we are developing for commercial release. At this time we are in the development and testing phase of the platform and camera integration. The platform is being tested on commercial farms in Brazil.
 
On January 7, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Ardour Capital Investments, LLC (“Ardour”) to provide advisory and capital raising services for a fee of $22,500 that was paid over three months. In addition, we will pay them for any capital investments they introduce to us that invest in us a fee of 7% of the total dollar amount raised as cash compensation and a warrant equal to 3% of the total shares issued in the transaction at an exercise price equal to 110% of the transaction market price. Ardour also will receive a cash fee of 3% of gross proceeds received from any straight debt-related transaction. In the event Ardour advises us in connection with any merger, acquisition or divestiture in whole or part of any of our assets or the acquisition of any target company and/or its assets, we will pay Ardour a cash success fee equal to 5% on the first $10,000,000 of Transaction Value (as defined in the agreement with Ardour), 4% on the next $5,000,000 of Transaction Value, 3% on the next $5,000,000 of Transaction Value and 2% on the balance of the total Transaction Value. The agreement remains in effect until written notice of termination by the Company 30 prior to the termination date.

On February 13, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Continental Advisory Services, LLC (“Continental”) to receive due diligence services with regards to securing debt financing for unspecified, potential business combinations, for an initial term of 180 days from February 17, 2017. Total fees for these services are $50,000, with $15,000 payable upon signing and the remaining $35,000 payable on May 10, 2017. In May 2017, the Company cancelled the agreement, and as of June 15, 2017 the Company has not paid the $35,000 that was due on May 10, 2017. We are contesting the remaining unpaid balance.
 
On February 17, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Caro Partners, LLC (“Caro”) to receive consulting services consisting of introductions to sources of financing, investor relations and public relations services, for a period of six months from February 17, 2017. In connection with the agreement, we agreed to issue 400,000 vested shares of common stock for a payment of $200 and to pay Caro consulting fees of $10,000 per month. The shares were valued on the February 17, 2017 measurement date at $0.23 per share or a total of $92,000 based on the quoted trading price which we will recognize over the six month service period. In June 2017, upon renewal of the agreement, the Company issued an additional 400,000 vested shares of common stock to this entity as payment for consulting services rendered valued at $93,160, or $0.2329 per share, based on the quoted trading price.
 
On March 28, 2017, we entered into an agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP (“TCA”) to receive a range of advisory services, particularly assistance with preparation of a business plan and financing strategies, for a total of $1,200,000. If we are quoted on a listed exchange, TCA will accept a single preferred share convertible into common stock never to exceed 4.99% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. The number of shares issued will be set at 100% of the amount due up to availability and subject to a make-whole provision. We have expensed this fee and recorded this as an accrued liability – advisory fee as of March 31, 2017.
 
In April 2017, we demonstrated our quadcopter system for various police departments in the State of Connecticut. As a result of our marketing efforts in the state, in May 2017, we received a purchase order from a Connecticut police department for one of our Shadow quadcopters. The UAV is scheduled for delivery to the police department in February 2018.
 
In June 2017, we entered into an agreement with an investment bank to provide placement agent services on an exclusive basis as it relates to a private placement (“the placement”). The agreement calls for the investment bank to receive 9% of the gross proceeds of the placement and 2.5% warrant coverage of the amount of raised. The warrants shall entitle the investment bank to purchase securities of the Company at a purchase price equal to 110% of the implied price per share of the placement or 100% of the public market closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the placement, whichever is lower. The warrants shall have a term of five years after the closing of the placement. The agreement expired on September 30, 2017, but we have continued to rely on them for sources of capital and have paid them in accordance with the terms of the prior agreement.
 
On November 15, 2017, we executed a Liability Purchase Term Sheet with Livingston Asset Management (“Livingston”) under which Livingston agreed to purchase up to $10,000,000 that we owe to our creditors through direct purchase of the debts from our creditors in return for (i) a convertible note issued by the Company in the principal amount of $50,000 bearing interest of 10% per year to cover certain legal fees and other expenses of Livingston that matures in six months and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a 30% reduction off the lowest closing bid price for 20 trading days prior to the date of conversion, (ii) a convertible note subject to these same terms as the convertible note issued to Livingston payable to Scottsdale Capital Advisors in the principal amount of $15,000 as a placement agent fee and (iii) the right of Livingston to retain 30% of any negotiated reduction off the face amount of the liability we owe to such creditors. Following a court judgment for the liabilities purchased by Livingston, we will issue free trading shares of our common stock under section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act to Livingston in the amount of such judgment in a series of tranches so that Livingston will not own more than 9.99% of our outstanding shares per tranche.
 
On December 6, 2017, we received a purchase order from a Fortune 500 company for 15 drones at a total purchase price of $21,979.50.

Growth Strategy
 
Our parent company intends to focus on primary drone sales, counter-drone technology sales, drone training and piloted licensed services.
 
Drone Sales
 
When we walk into a police station, a firehouse or a business our primary goal is to match the perfect drone or drones to that customer. To accomplish this, we have aligned with several drone manufacturers, so we can offer a whole line card of drones. We desire to be the “DroneRUS” of the drone world offering a wide variety of drones at different price points from simple surveillance drones that can fly between 20 minutes and up to one hour, follow a speeding car, avoid obstacles while chasing the speed car such as trees and buildings and re acquire the car if lost. We desire to be our customers’ one-stop shop for all their drone needs.
Counter-Drone Technology Sales
 
Unfortunately, we will all witness the inevitable increase of illegal drone use by drug dealers, terrorists and other unsavory people. For this reason, we have partnered with two counter-drone technology companies to offer drone detection, drone signal jamming and drone system takeover technology that will ultimately aid law enforcement, U.S. industry and our U.S. Government and state governments in combating illegal drones. The market for counter-drone technology could possibly rival the drone market in the not too distant future.
Drone Operator Training
 
We have partnered with DARTDrones to offer drone training throughout the continental United States. In February 2017, DARTDrones received an investment offer on Shark Tank from Mark Cuban. https://www.dartdrones.com/ When signing up for a class, our customers present the coupon “DRONEUSA15” and they will receive a 15% discount on all DARTDrones training. The in-person training includes basic flight training, aerial mapping and modeling, FAA 107 remote pilot test prep and aerial roof inspection training. The online training includes drones for beginners, aerial photography, starting a drone business, Part 107 remote pilot test prep.
Licensed Piloted Services
 
We understand that some police departments and businesses will not want to establish drone programs, employ FAA Part 107 pilots or own their own drones. For this reason, we provide a number of services such search and rescue, utility inspection, real estate marketing, construction, engineering and agriculture. When a service call is received, we respond immediately with a licensed pilot equipped with drones and charged batteries ready to perform the mission requested.
Acquisitions
 
Acquisitions also are an important pillar to our overall growth strategy, providing revenue, earnings, infrastructure and synergies. We seek opportunities with innovative and commercially proven technologies primarily in the UAV industry. We seek profitable firms that complement our overall strategy. We are currently evaluating companies worldwide.
 
An important element of our mergers and acquisitions strategy is to acquire companies with complementary capabilities/technologies and an established customer base in our target markets. We believe that the customer base of each potential acquisition will present an opportunity to cross-sell solutions to the customer base of other acquired companies. We are looking to expand our public sector clients beyond what the Howco acquisition has brought us. Public sector customers provide very large multi-year contracts that we believe can provide secure revenue visibility typically for three to five years. Based on our experience in government contracting, we have a core competency in bidding on government requests for proposals (RFPs). We are actively seeking companies that have built a backlog with various government agencies that can complement our existing contracts through Howco.

Drone's Markets
 
The market for commercial drones has grown significantly over the last several years and is expected to continue doing so following the release of recent rules by the FAA for commercial drone use. The FAA in its discussion of the new rules governing commercial drones stated that that the drone rules could generate more than $82 billion and create more than 100,000 jobs over the next 10 years. The Teal Group estimated that the global commercial UAV marketplace reached $387 million in 2016 and projects the market to reach $6.5 billion by 2025 with a CAGR of 32.6%.
 
The military has transformed into a smaller, more agile fighting force in need of a network of technologies to provide improved observation, communication and precision targeting of combat troop locations, which are often embedded in dense population centers or dispersed in remote locations. According to the Teal Group, the global military UAV marketplace reached $2.8 billion in 2016 and is expected to generate more than $9.8 billion in UAV purchases by 2025 with a CAGR of 14.4%.

Market research media analysts have found that there is a widening gap between growing a UAV fleet and UAV infrastructure development, especially in such sectors as training; service, support and maintenance and data management. This gap creates a number of market opportunities for UAV vendors, both large defense contractors and small technology companies. According to UAV Market Research, military procurement of UAVs, including unmanned aircrafts and payloads, makes the Department of Defense the single largest consumer of UAV technology in the world. We believe that the U.S. Government will continue to invest in UAVs as much as needed to keep its dominance, both technologically and to demonstrate its power, in the next decades.
 
Given the growth and demand in this market, we believe that UAV’s will be a universal tool for government bodies and agencies, particularly focused on law enforcement. Police departments have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to buy firearms, armored cars and electronic surveillance gear, according to the annual reports submitted by local and state agencies to the Justice Department’s Equitable Sharing Program. Police and law enforcement agencies purchase an expensive mix of high-tech military products, in particular electronic surveillance equipment, for both their technological innovations for supporting their efforts to promote public and citizen confidence by demonstrating their receptiveness to new practices of upholding the law and protecting the public well-being.
 
Howco's Business
 
Howco is a premier supplier of spare and replacement parts to a wide variety of Federal Government agencies, U.S. military prime contractors and commercial customers worldwide. Founded in 1990 and located in Vancouver, Washington, Howco's services encompass bid solicitation, contract management, packaging and logistics for construction, transportation, mining and heavy equipment spare and replacement parts to customers worldwide utilizing a wide variety of supply chain solutions. Howco was the winner of the 2012 United States’ Department of Defense Logistics Agency’s Bronze Supplier Award. Howco reported revenues of approximately $24 million and $18 million, and net income of approximately $252,000 and $902,000, for the year ended September 30, 2017, and the period from October 1, 2015 through September 9, 2016, prior to our acquisition of Drone USA, respectively.
Howco's Government Services Contracts
 
Howco enters into various types of contracts with our customers, such as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Completion, Cost-reimbursement (CR), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price Incentive (FPI) and Time-and-Materials (T&M). Approximately 91% of Howco’s and revenues are FFP and approximately 11% of its revenues are IDIQ.
 
IDIQ contracts provide for an indefinite quantity of services or stated limits of supplies for a fixed period. They are used when the customer cannot determine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that the government will require during the contract period. IDIQs help streamline the contract process and speed service delivery. IDIQ contracts are most often used for service contracts and architect-engineering services. Awards are usually for base years and option years. The customer places delivery orders (for supplies) or task orders (for services) against a basic contract for individual requirements. Minimum and maximum quantity limits are specified in the basic contract as either a number of units (for supplies) or as dollar values (for services).

CPFF LOE contracts will be issued when the scope of work is defined in general terms requiring only that the contractor devote a specified LOE for a stated time period. A CPFF completion contract will be issued when the scope of work defines a definite goal or target which leads to an end product deliverable (e.g., a final report of research accomplishing the goal or target).
 
CR contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. These contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed (except at its own risk) without the approval of the contracting officer and are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.
 
FFP contract will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of definite or detailed specifications and fair and reasonable prices can be established at the outset.
 
FPI target delivery contract will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of reasonably definite or detailed specifications and cost can be reasonably predicted at the outset wherein the cost risk will be shared. A firm target cost, target profit, and profit adjustment formula will be negotiated to provide a fair and reasonable incentive and a ceiling that provides for the contractor to assume an appropriate share of the risk.
 
T&M contracts provide for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of (i) direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit; and (ii) actual cost for materials. A customer may use this contract when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.
 
Market Size 
 
According to Todd Harrison, author of “Analysis of the FY 2017 Budget,” one-third of the DoD budget request, $184.4 billion, is for procurement and research, development, test, and evaluation (“RDT&E”). The U.S. Government spends a portion of this budget on the shipping of replacement parts annually. 
Intellectual Property
 
We review each of our intellectual properties and make a determination as to the best means to protect such property, by trademark, by copyright, by patent, by trade secret, or otherwise. We believe that we have taken appropriate steps to protect our intellectual properties, based on our evaluation of the factors unique to each such property, but cannot guarantee that this is the case.
Regulatory Matters
 
The use of unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes is governed by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”). On August 29, 2016, the new FAA rules took effect for commercial use of small drones. Under the FAA rules commercial drones must be under 55 pounds and be registered with the FAA. The rules require a new "remote pilot certificate", daylight-only operations 30 minutes before official sunrise and 30 minutes after official sunset, a requirement that all flights travel at a maximum groundspeed of 100 miles per hour remain, below 400 feet or within 400 feet of a structure and yield the right of way to other aircraft. Under the FAA rules, drone pilots must be at least 16 years old or be supervised by an adult with a remote pilot certificate. The pilot must also maintain "visual line of sight" with the drone at all times, among other requirements. The new rules also require that any drone-related incident that results in at least $500 worth of damage or causes serious injury be reported to the FAA within 10 days. The new restrictions can be waived, but pilots will need to apply directly to the FAA for an exemption and/or a waiver.

Competition
 
Drone USA
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for UAVs include product performance, features, acquisition cost, lifetime operating cost, ease of use, integration with existing equipment, size, mobility, quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation. We intend to acquire companies that give us a competitive advantage with our prospective government and commercial customers.
 
The market leaders in UAV manufacturing are mostly international and are located in tech hubs. Asia has the most UAV manufacturers currently in operation. Chinese manufacturer DJI is the market leader in the mid to high end recreational platform, followed by French based Parrot with a mid-market recreational platform, and several companies such as XAircraft American based in the United States, with low to mid-market recreational platforms. In addition, in the United States there are large defense contractors, among them Boeing, Northrup Grumman, TCOM, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, ISL, ILC Dover, Compass Systems, Raven Aerostar and American Blimp Corporation offering military grade free flying drones to the U.S. Government. There is also potential competition from commercial grade tethered drone systems which remain tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether, such as offered by Elistair located in Lyon, France and Cyphy Works Inc. located in Danvers, Massachusetts.
 
Howco
 
The business of supplying spare and replacement parts to Federal Government agencies, U.S. military prime contractors and commercial customers is very competitive. Among our U.S. based competitors are JGILS that supplies parts manufactured by Fairbanks Morse/Coltec and other brands, Ohio Cat that supplies Caterpillar parts, and Kampi Components and Brighton Cromwell, both of which compete with us in several brands. 
Employees
 
We have 15 full-time employees, two of whom are with Drone USA and 13 of whom are with Howco, and two part-time employees with Howco. We have no labor union contracts and believe relations with our employees are satisfactory.Debt Instruments
 
On April 1, 2016, we entered into a revolving line of credit with Key Bank. This revolving line of credit is in the amount of $50,000, and is personally guaranteed by our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The loan bears interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the prime rate, currently 3.50%, plus 4.25%. As of September 30, 2017, the balance of the line of credit is approximately $49,000.
 
We have an $840,000 convertible note dated December 11, 2015, payable with Abatement Industries Group, Inc. (“AIG”), an entity controlled by our CEO. The Note bears interest at an annual rate of 7% with a maturity date of June 11, 2017, at which time all unpaid principal and interest is due.

In connection with the acquisition of Howco on September 9, 2016, we issued a note payable to the sellers in the amount of $900,000. The note bears an interest of 5.5% and all unpaid principal and accrued interest is due on September 9, 2017. The note is in default and is accruing interest at 8% per year. The note is subordinated to the TCA loan described below. As of September 30, 2017, the note payable has a balance of approximately $900,000 with accrued interest of approximately $54,000.
 
Effective September 13, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility agreement (the “Credit Facility” or the “Agreement”) with TCA Global Credit Master Fund L.P (“TCA”) to provide capital for the acquisition of HowCo. We can borrow up to $6,500,000, with an initial loan at closing of $3,500,000. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all our assets and our subsidiaries and bears interest at a rate of 18%, requires monthly payments of $52,500 which is interest only starting on October 13, 2016 through February 13, 2017, and monthly payments, including interest and principal, of $298,341 starting on March 13, 2017 through maturity on March 13, 2018. Events of default are defined in the Agreement. In the event of default the note balance will bear interest at 25%. In connection with this Agreement, we are obligated to pay additional advisory fees of $850,000 payable in the form of cash or common stock in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. We were also required to reserve 7,000,000 shares of common stock related to this transaction. The reserved shares will be released upon the satisfaction of the loan. In the event TCA makes additional loans under the Agreement, we agree to pay additional advisory fees under similar terms as the $850,000 fee. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, except in limited circumstances, we are not permitted to encumber any of our assets, sell any shares of common stock or incur additional indebtedness without TCA's prior written consent. All of our assets, including the assets of Howco, are secured by the TCA credit facility, which could be sold by TCA to satisfy the debt we owe it should we not be able to repay TCA in full.
 
As of March 31, 2017, we issued to TCA 539,204 shares of common stock in satisfaction of the $850,000 advisory fees in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility. Based upon the value of the shares, at the time TCA sells the shares, we may be required to redeem unsold shares for the difference between the $850,000 and TCA’s sales proceeds. Accordingly, the $850,000 has been reflected as a current liability as of September 30, 2017. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement to the contrary, in the event TCA has not realized net proceeds from the sale of Advisory Fee Shares equal to at least the Advisory Fee by the earlier to occur of: (A) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Effective Date; (B) the occurrence of an Event of Default; or (C) the Maturity Date, then at any time thereafter, TCA shall have the right, upon written notice to us, to require that we redeem all Advisory Fee Shares then in TCA’s possession for cash equal to the Advisory Fee, less any cash proceeds received by TCA from any previous sales of Advisory Fee Shares, if any. In the event such redemption notice is given by TCA, we shall redeem the then remaining Advisory Fee Shares in TCA’s possession for an amount of Dollars equal to the Advisory Fee, less any cash proceeds received by TCA from any previous sales of Advisory Fee Shares, if any, payable by wire transfer to an account designated by TCA within five (5) Business Days from the date TCA delivers such redemption notice to us. As of September 30, 2017, the note payable has not been converted and the balance of the note was $3,500,000 and accrued interest was $169,417. The Credit Facility is only convertible upon default or mutual agreement by both parties. Once a default occurs the note will be accounted for as stock settled debt at its fixed monetary value and any shares issued upon conversion are also subject to a make whole provision similar to that described above for the $850,000. On March 13, 2017, we defaulted on the monthly principal and interest payment of $298,341. On April 13, 2017, the Company received a default notice from the lender and was given a 10-day period to cure the default. The note became convertible and the interest rate increased to 25% (default rate) upon expiration of the default cure period, as the default was not cured. From March to December 2017, the Company has not made the required monthly contracted payments. We have been in discussions with TCA and TCA has agreed informally to work with us to achieve our business plan as long as we are continuing to make progress in that regard.
 
In June 2016, we opened a credit card account with American Express Bank. Payment of the entire balance is due monthly upon receipt of the statement. The card has been cancelled and as of September 30, 2017 has a current unpaid balance of approximately $191,000. We have established a payment plan in December 2017 with American Express to retire this debt obligation.
 
On August 18, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Rockwell Capital Partners, Inc. (“Rockwell”) in connection with a section 3(a)(10) transaction under the Securities Act where we issued to Rockwell a convertible note in the principal amount of $102,102.74. To limit the number of our shares that Rockwell would have to sell and thus limit the potential pressure on the trading price of our common stock in August 2016 we issued 68,500 shares of our common stock to Rockwell, of which 11,500 were a settlement fee and the balance were for payment of $58,105 of the convertible note, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 issued an additional 460,200 shares for the remaining balance of the note as part of the Settlement Agreement for a total of 528,700 shares issued to Rockwell.

Emerging Growth Company
 
We are and we will remain an "emerging growth company" as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a "large accelerated filer" (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
As an "emerging growth company", we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
 
• only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” disclosure;
 
• reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
 
• no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
 
• exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
 
We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
 
Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a “smaller reporting company”, at such time as we cease being an “emerging growth company”, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an “emerging growth company” or a “smaller reporting company”.  Specifically, similar to “emerging growth companies”, “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being k]=required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.
