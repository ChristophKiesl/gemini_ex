BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
We are an early-stage Cayman Islands exempted company structured as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities and activities related to our initial public offering.
Initial Public Offering
 
On December 17, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 11,500,000 units (the “units”). Each unit consists of one ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “ordinary shares”), and one-half of one warrant of the Company (“warrant”), with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one ordinary share for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $115,000,000. 
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,450,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”), including 4,905,000 private placement warrants to ATAC Limited Partnership (our “sponsor”) and 545,000 private placement warrants to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (the “representative”), at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,450,000.
 
A total of $116,150,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “trust account”) maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 
It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Jorge Marcos, our Chief Executive Officer, Juan Pablo Visoso, our Chief Financial Officer and Lisa Harris, our Chairman, who have many years of experience investing in ventures and building companies with operations. We must complete our initial business combination by December 17, 2021, 12 months from the closing of our initial public offering, unless otherwise extended. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination may be extended if our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, deposit into the trust account $1,150,000 ($0.10 per share in either case), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each of the available three month extensions providing a total possible business combination period of 18 months at a total payment value of $2,300,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. Any such payments would be made in the form of non-interest bearing loans. If our initial business combination is not consummated by December 17, 2021 (or June 17, 2021 if we extend the time period to consummate our initial business combination by the full amount of time), then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, since our initial public offering, we have focused our search on targets operating in the TMT verticals. We leverage the substantial proprietary deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of our management team and strategic advisors, including their relationships with leading business leaders and entrepreneurs. 
 
In addition, we leverage the deep relationships and long-standing experience that our management team and strategic advisors command in the global private equity asset management industry. We believe that this combination of relationships and experience puts us in an excellent position to locate potential targets, particularly those owned by private equity funds. 
 
Business Strategy and Acquisition Criteria
 
Based on both our management team’s experience, combined with the current trends they are observing, we have developed the following strategy and set of criteria we utilize in our pursuit of a business. 
 
Businesses with robust local presence, clear expansion opportunity in the Americas, and significant US Dollar-denominated revenue, with a broad focus across all TMT verticals. We see strong secular tailwinds in these sectors that we believe provide the necessary runway for general industry growth and profitability over the next decade. As global commerce becomes more globally interconnected, we believe a larger portion of economic participation will take place adjacent to or within the different verticals.

Initial focus on pockets of ultra-high growth within mobile and digital technologies, which are part of strong transformational technological trends that have accelerated due, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific verticals include, but are not limited to, cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, mobile applications, digital advertising, digital content, media, fintech, e-commerce and mobility. Businesses throughout North America and South America are now looking to channel their commercial activities through the mobile ecosystem, leading to the emergence of so-called “Super Apps”, and intend to capitalize on the increased ubiquity of the smartphone, as well as now-prevalent and improving internet connectivity. Incumbent players are actively looking for solutions that allow them to drive engagement and customer behaviors, preferably through proprietary channels, instead of having to go through the incumbent ad giants. Our focus does not limit us to the TMT sector, as we believe there are ample opportunities that capitalize on these trends within other sectors such as healthcare, retail, financial services, real estate, hospitality, agribusiness and others that rely on technology-driven solutions to improve their business models. 
 
Established, well run and profitable companies operating in a range of services and markets currently unpenetrated by global giants. Well-capitalized players are positioned to use the slowdown as an opportunity to strengthen their long-term strategic positions. We are prioritizing companies that have visible opportunities and deploy capital in this environment to make acquisitions or accelerate organic growth opportunities. 
 
A focus towards recurring contractual revenue and a clear roadmap to increased user monetization and monetization engine scalability. This is enabled by “sticky” relationships with customers, which in turn are derived from a superior customer experience and high switching costs, among other competitive advantages. Most sectors are facing uncertainties amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but other businesses that enable the “new normal” have benefitted. Growth businesses with strong value propositions and innovative products, with opportunities to deploy capital at high risk-adjusted returns, are of particular interest. 
 
Proven high-growth trajectory, with potential for geographic expansion to continue delivering growth and achieve profitability within a reasonable timeframe. After dominating initial markets, target companies should have an edge to expand geographically to un-tapped or underserved regions where similar needs exist. 
 
Experienced management team.   We intend to consummate a business combination with a business that has an experienced management team with a proven track record for generating shareholder returns, producing corporate growth, enhancing profitability, generating positive free cash flow, and with an ability to clearly and confidently articulate the business strategy and market opportunities to public market investors. Management should also be experienced in successfully identifying, transacting, and integrating acquisitions. Where necessary, we may also look to complement and enhance the capabilities of the target business’ management team by recruiting additional talent through our network of contacts. This may include recruiting experienced industry professionals to assist in our evaluation of the opportunity and marketing of the initial business combination prior to its completion, who may ultimately assume an ongoing role with the combined company. While not a requirement, we would prefer opportunities where members of the management team of the target have experience as public company officers or other substantive public market experience. 
 
Sourced on a proprietary basis.   We do not expect to participate in broadly marketed processes, but rather will aim to leverage our extensive network to source a proprietary initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would consider participating in a process that is focused primarily on special purpose acquisition companies, where we would not compete with a conventional initial public offering or private equity acquisition, or where the target is at the tail end of a strategic process in which other alternatives have been eliminated. We would expect to compete in such processes on the strength of our prior experience in closing business combinations, understanding of the target’s industry, ability to add strategic value, or because our company is most appropriately sized to the target. 
 
Preparedness for the process and public markets. We are seeking to acquire a business that has or can put in place, prior to the closing of a business combination, the governance, financial systems and controls and investor relations capabilities required in the public markets. 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, these criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. 
 
Competitive Advantages
 
Experienced Management Team and Special Advisors. Our management team and strategic advisors have a substantial middle-market cross-border investment track record and advisory experience, significant knowledge of both the North and South American markets, access to proprietary deal flow throughout the two continents, and strong relationships with business leaders, entrepreneurs and investors. We believe their backgrounds provide us with access to proprietary investment opportunities and position us to successfully navigate local business norms. In addition, members of management team have significant prior experience in consummating merger and acquisition transactions, including executing initial business combinations for blank check companies, having already sponsored five special purpose acquisition vehicles (four of which were done in Italy).

​ 
 We may also draw upon the services of Fifth Partners, an affiliate of our sponsor and our Chief Executive Officer. Fifth Partners is a private equity group located in Dallas, Texas. An active investment partner, it provides network companies access to the people, opportunities and capital needed to build sustainable enterprises. Since its founding in 2015, Fifth Partners has deployed over $1.5 billion across various asset classes, including real estate and energy. In addition to hard asset investing, Fifth Partners also owns and operates multiple early- to mid-stage businesses.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, past performance of our management team, advisors, Fifth Partners or their respective affiliates is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. 
 
Established Deal Sourcing Network and Personal Contacts.   We intend to maximize our pipeline of potential target investments by proactively approaching our extensive network of contacts, including private equity and venture capital sponsors, family offices, executives of public and private companies, merger and acquisition advisory firms, investment banks, capital markets desks, lenders and other financial intermediaries. We believe the prior investment experience, transaction history and track record of our team, give us a competitive advantage when sourcing potential initial business combination opportunities. 
Deal-making and Capital Markets Experience through all Market Cycles.   Our management team and strategic advisors consists of seasoned dealmakers with experience in a wide variety of industries, structures and market conditions, as well as experienced equity and debt capital markets professionals. All have worked in markets throughout the Americas as executives, principal investors, and advisors, through different market cycles. Our management team and strategic advisors apply the same disciplined approach to acquire a business that they have used in connection with their current advisory services and principal investment activities. 
Experience with Complex Transactions.   Members of our management team and strategic advisors have a track record of completing transactions that involve an element of complexity not well-served by a competitive auction process and on educating counterparties about the benefits of the special purpose acquisition company structure and process. We believe that our management team’s and strategic advisors’ experience with complex situations requiring creative solutions is expected to lead to less competitive transactions. Members of our management team and strategic advisors also have a history of leveraging their relationship networks for due diligence. 
Initial Business Combination
 
NYSE rules require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding any taxes payable). If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent valuation or appraisal firm that regularly provides fairness opinions solely with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value meets the 80% fair market value test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. 
 
We will structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NYSE’s 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

Our Business Combination Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we will continue to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information made available to us and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We may also retain consultants with expertise relating to a prospective target business. 
 
Fifth Partners may, from time to time, assist us in the identification of assets or companies that may be appropriate acquisition targets. While we may also draw upon Fifth Partners’ platforms, infrastructure, personnel, network and relationships to provide access to deal prospects, along with any necessary resources to aid in the identification and diligence of a target for the initial business combination, Fifth Partners is not obligated to identify any such target assets or companies or to perform due diligence on any acquisition targets. Any such activities are solely the responsibility of our management team. 
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent valuation or appraisal firm that regularly provides fairness opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. In addition, we have not contacted any of the prospective target businesses that prior blank check companies with which our officers and directors have been involved, and had considered and rejected. We do not currently intend to contact any of such targets; however, we may do so in the future if we become aware that the valuations, operations, profits or prospects of such target business, or the benefits of any potential transaction with such target business, would be attractive. 
 
Members of our management team directly and indirectly own our securities following our initial public offering, and accordingly, they have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 
In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple corporate affiliations, each of our officers and directors has contractually agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, until the earliest of a business combination, our liquidation or such time as he ceases to be an officer or director, to present to our company for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity, any suitable business opportunity which may reasonably be required to be presented to us, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations he might have. Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including other blank check companies, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination. 
 
Our officers and directors may, under certain circumstances, become an officer or director of another special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities intended to be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, even before we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination. 
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until we consummate our initial business combination. We will utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private warrants, our share capital, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private warrants are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in this report, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination. 
 
9

 

We have until December 17, 2021 (or June 17, 2021 if we extend the time period to consummate our initial business combination by the full amount of time) to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by December 17, 2021, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (to June 17, 2021 to complete a business combination), subject to the sponsor depositing additional funds into the trust account as set out below. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this report, in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $1,150,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per unit, or up to an aggregate of $2,300,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the applicable deadline of its wish for us to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will redeem 100% of our issued and outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.10 per public share (regardless of whether or not the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option), without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. Our public shareholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. As a result, we may conduct such an extension even though a majority of our public shareholders do not support such an extension and will not be able to redeem their shares in connection therewith. 
 
We Have Not Identified a Target Business
 
To date, we have not selected any target business on which to concentrate our search for a business combination. None of our officers, directors, initial shareholders and other affiliates has engaged in discussions on our behalf with representatives of other companies regarding the possibility of a potential merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with us, nor have we, nor any of our agents or affiliates, been approached by any candidates (or representatives of any candidates) with respect to a possible business combination with our company. 
 
Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. To the extent we effect a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
Our business combination must be with a target business or businesses that collectively satisfy the minimum valuation standard at the time of such acquisition, as discussed above, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses at the same time. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 
 
10

 


· | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. 
 
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management
 
Although we scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. 
 
Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a general meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require us to conduct a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will only consummate our initial business combination if we have net tangible assets (after redemption) of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company.
 
11

 

We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 as described above to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait until December 17, 2021 (or June 17, 2021 if we extend the period of time to consummate the business combination by the full amount of time) in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account. 
 
Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought shareholder approval of a proposed transaction, we would need only 4,250,001 of our public shares (or approximately 36.96% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised, that the initial shareholders do not purchase any units in our initial public offering or units or shares in the after-market and that the 125,000 representative shares are voted in favor of the transaction). 
 
None of our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or ordinary shares in our initial public offering or from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a general meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock. 
 
Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers and directors have, pursuant to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares or public shares held by them redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a permitted transfer from an initial shareholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares in our initial public offering or thereafter through open market purchases, it would be a public shareholder and restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any Excess Shares. 
 
Conversion/Tender Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law as redemptions. If we hold a general meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares. 
 
Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public shareholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.

Our initial shareholders, officers and directors do not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in our initial offering or in the aftermarket. Additionally, the holders of the representative shares will not have conversion rights with respect to the representative shares. 
 
We may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using DTC’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the legal holder, and effectively redeemed by us under Cayman Islands law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any general meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to. 
 
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders. 
 
Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). 
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders. 
 
Automatic Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination by December 17, 2021 (or June 17, 2021 if we extend the period of time to consummate the business combination by the full amount of time), it will trigger our automatic winding up, liquidation and dissolution pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, liquidation and dissolution. 
 
The amount in the trust account (less approximately $1,000 representing the aggregate nominal par value of the shares of our public shareholders) under the Companies Law will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Companies Law provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest, net of taxes payable). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.

Each of our initial shareholders and our sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private warrants and to vote their insider shares in favor of any dissolution and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, or additional funds deposited in the trust account in order to extend the period of time we have to consummate our initial business combination, the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be $10.10. 
 
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. 
 
Our sponsor has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of our initial public offering not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve any amount to satisfy any indemnification obligations that may arise and its only assets are expected to be our securities. Accordingly, we believe it is unlikely that it will be able to satisfy those indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.10 due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy or wind-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or wind-up petition is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy or insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.10 per share. 
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. 
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses: 
 

· | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the NYSE may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our outstanding warrants and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | our obligation to pay EarlyBirdCapital an aggregate fee of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of our initial public offering upon consummation of our initial business combination pursuant to the business combination marketing agreement, as described under the section titled “Underwriting — Business Combination Marketing Agreement”;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to either repay or issue warrants upon conversion of up to $1,000,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private warrants (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms. Furthermore, the fact that we will not be required to pay our underwriters any deferred compensation upon consummation of an initial business combination may give us a competitive advantage over other similarly structured blank check companies. 
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. 
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they l devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, the financial information included in the proxy solicitation materials will need to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. The financial statements may also be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Form 8-K announcing the closing of an initial business combination, which would need to be filed within four business days thereafter. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial information. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. 
 
We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or our total revenues exceed $1.0 billion or revenues exceed $1.07 billion, or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
