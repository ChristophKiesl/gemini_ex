ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading global provider of connected fleet and mobile asset solutions delivered as Software as a Service (“SaaS”). Our solutions deliver a measurable return by enabling our customers to manage, optimize and protect their investments in commercial fleets or personal vehicles. We generate actionable insights that enable a wide range of customers, from large enterprise fleets to small fleet operators and consumers, to reduce fuel and other operating costs, improve efficiency, enhance regulatory compliance, enhance driver safety, manage risk and mitigate theft. Our solutions mostly rely on our proprietary, highly scalable technology platforms, which allow us to collect, analyze and deliver information based on data from our customers’ vehicles. Using an intuitive, web-based interface, dashboards or mobile apps, our fleet customers can access large volumes of real-time and historical data, monitor the location and status of their drivers and vehicles and analyze a wide number of key metrics across their fleet operations.
We have a large global presence, with vehicle subscriptions in over 120 countries across six continents. We currently serve a highly diverse customer base, including 4,900 fleet operators, which represented 68% of our subscription revenue for fiscal year 2022. We target sales of our enterprise fleet management solutions to customers who desire a premium solution, generally for large fleets, which we define as fleets of 50 or more vehicles. Large fleets accounted for over 86% of our fleet subscriptions at March 31, 2022. We believe we have a satisfied customer base and, among our more than 1,000 large fleet operator customers, we experienced an annual customer retention rate of 93% in fiscal year 2022. In addition, for large fleets with 500 or more vehicles, we experienced an annual customer retention rate in excess of 98% in fiscal year 2022. We have multinational enterprise fleet customer deployments with companies such as Baker Hughes, BP, Chevron, DHL, G4S, Halliburton, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Schlumberger, Shell, The Linde Group, Total and Weatherford. We also offer a range of subscription-based fleet and vehicle management solutions to meet the needs and price points of small fleet operators and consumers. Our safety and security features, including driver performance and vehicle monitoring, are important attributes of our solutions for these customers.
With the exception of fiscal year 2021, we have consistently grown our customer base. As evidence of this growth, subscribers, one of our key operating metrics and a factor influencing our rate of subscription revenue growth, increased at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2022, and as of March 31, 2022, we tracked and managed over 815,000 subscribers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal year 2021 represented the only year of net subscriber contraction over this period of 73,800 subscribers, resulting in a 6.1% reduction in subscription revenue for the period, on a constant currency basis. As a further indicator of our scale, in fiscal year 2022, we collected data on approximately 155 million trips per month and recorded approximately 9.7 billion vehicle positions per month. The monthly price charged per subscriber varies among our customers depending on the services and features they require, hardware options, customer size, route to market and geographic location of the customer. Consequently, our rate of subscription revenue growth is influenced by not only the rate of growth in the number of subscribers but also by the evolving mix of our subscriber base.
Industry Overview
Challenges Facing Fleet Operators Worldwide
Fleet managers operate in an increasingly competitive and highly regulated global environment. Timely and accurate decision-making enabled by solutions that provide real-time visibility into vehicle location and driver performance is critical to managing a safe, efficient fleet. In some developing areas of the world, ensuring driver and vehicle safety and security is also particularly challenging given high crime rates, which have resulted in automotive insurance mandates and regulatory requirements for vehicle tracking. Consequently, fleet managers and consumers demand solutions that promote driver and passenger safety, mitigate risk, drive operational efficiencies, improve security and reduce automotive insurance costs. The business environment for fleet managers is further complicated by the large number of transportation-related regulatory and compliance requirements worldwide, and the frequency with which rules and regulations change.
Legacy fleet management solutions inadequately address industry needs as many businesses use discrete manual processes, such as spreadsheet and paper-based systems and telephones, to monitor vehicle and driver activity. These approaches are labor intensive, prone to error, do not provide continuous monitoring of fleets, make it difficult to optimize fleet utilization, manage operating costs and generate minimal business intelligence. Additionally, legacy fleet management technology frequently provides limited functionality beyond basic location-based tracking and makes it difficult for fleet 
operators to fully benefit from the cost savings and efficiency improvements associated with more robust fleet management offerings.
Fleet operators face many significant challenges, which can include:
•Significant operating costs. According to the American Transport Research Institute’s 2020 data, fuel represents 34%, repair & maintenance 16%, truck insurance premiums 10% and tires 4% of vehicle-based trucking operational costs per mile. Combined, these factors account for 64% of vehicle-based operational costs per mile, all of which can be reduced through connected fleet solutions and the process of positively impacting driving behaviors, including by reducing behaviors like speeding, harsh acceleration, harsh braking and excessive idling.
•Poor visibility into fleet operations. Fleet operators frequently maintain vehicles across multiple geographic regions and often lack visibility into their fleets and oversight of their drivers. Poor fleet visibility makes it challenging to optimize fleet utilization, vehicle fleet size and miles driven while still meeting core business and customer servicing requirements. Poor driver oversight makes it difficult for operators to validate hours worked or customers visited, incentivize greater efficiency and discourage unproductive, undesirable or dangerous worker behavior.
•Challenges in maintaining regulatory compliance. Internal compliance and reporting is driven by legislative and regulatory requirements, which are often subject to change, from regulatory authorities in nearly every jurisdiction globally. This can be particularly burdensome for fleet operators managing large vehicle fleets in multiple jurisdictions. For example, in the United States, fleet operators can face numerous complex regulatory requirements, including mandatory hours of service compliance and fuel tax reporting and more recently electronic logging devices (“ELD”) legislation that requires truck drivers to log their hours of service electronically.
•Challenges in managing risk. Fleet operators are responsible for hiring, training and identifying risks associated with their drivers. Vehicle crashes are a leading cause of workplace injury and lead to significant costs for fleet operators, including financial liability and increased insurance premiums. Fleet operators need visibility into driving behavior to proactively identify and remediate drivers with poor driving habits.
•Inefficient data management. Fleet operators receive operational information from many disparate sources, including communications from their technicians and customers, paper-based reports, third-party receipts for items such as fuel purchases, vehicle maintenance logs and customer invoices. While simply collecting this unstructured data is burdensome, organizing and analyzing the data to identify trends and other actionable business intelligence can be even more challenging.
Challenges Facing Fleet Operators and Consumers in Developing Markets
In certain developing regions of the world, driver safety and vehicle security are significant concerns given high crime rates and the impact these higher crime rates have on consumers, insurance costs and regulatory requirements. More specifically, fleet operators and consumers often need to address challenges including:
•Managing the impact of crime. Vehicle crime rates in developing regions of the world often far exceed those in the United States and Western Europe, resulting in potentially significant costs for fleet operators and consumers. For example, we estimate that the rate of vehicle theft in South Africa is approximately double that in the United States.
•Reducing insurance costs. In developed and developing regions, insurers often provide incentives for fleet operators and consumers who subscribe to a safety and security mobile asset management solution. Some insurance providers will not insure vehicles that lack a tracking solution, or will make the insurance premium cost prohibitive without one. Furthermore, insurance provider interest in safety and security solutions has increased following the introduction of driver performance monitoring solutions, which can enable innovative usage-based insurance and claims management initiatives.
•Complying with regulatory mandates. The growing introduction of stringent occupational health and safety legislation in developing markets is adding pressure to fleet operators, who need to fulfill their duty of care while also complying with laws regulating driving hours, rest time, fuel taxes, etc.
Industry Trends
There have been substantial advances in the capabilities, reliability and affordability of technologies that can be used to cost-effectively collect and disseminate large amounts of vehicle data and video footage. GPS positioning and advanced on-board systems generate valuable, objective real-time information, which provides the basis for driver and vehicle management solutions. Similarly, significant advances in the performance, reliability and affordability of fixed and wireless networks, computing power and data storage capabilities have supported the rise of cloud computing that enables the delivery of SaaS. These technological advances and market shifts have helped to foster demand for subscription-based fleet and mobile asset management solutions like ours.
While fleet and mobile asset management solutions can offer a wide range of features and benefits, the reasons for adopting these solutions often vary by customer type and geography. In developed regions, including North America and Western Europe, many fleet operators adopt fleet management software solutions in order to obtain greater visibility over their vehicles and mobile workforces, to achieve cost savings through efficiency improvements, including reduced fuel consumption, and to reduce regulatory compliance burdens. In many developing regions, including Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, the security of personnel and asset protection features afforded by vehicle tracking and monitoring, resulting in greater asset visibility and a lower impact of theft, are also important reasons for the adoption of fleet and mobile asset management solutions. In Australia and parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, compliance with health and safety standards and policies are a key reason for adoption of these systems. Recognizing the variety of motivations influencing our existing and potential customers is an important aspect of developing and marketing our solutions.
Global and multinational companies are increasingly looking to consolidate their fleet management systems by moving to providers that have global reach. This is primarily driven by the desire to have a secure centralized view across their fleets and impose set global standards specifically relating to driver management and safety. These companies also recognize the advantages of gathering vast quantities of data to draw new insights into their global fleet operations.
A research publication by Berg Insight says the integration of cameras to enable various video-based solutions in commercial vehicle environments is one of the most apparent trends in the fleet telematics sector today. Growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 16.5% they forecast that the active installed base of video telematics systems will reach almost 6.3 million units in North America by 2026. In Europe, the active installed base is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 17.9% to reach 2.1 million video telematics systems by 2026. The video telematics market is served by many companies including video specialists, fleet telematics players and hardware-focused suppliers. With MiX Vision AI which was launched in fiscal year 2022 we will better be able to serve the video telematics market.
Market Opportunity
We believe that the addressable market for our fleet management solutions is large, growing and under-penetrated. According to a report by ABI Research (“ABI”), there were approximately 225 million commercial vehicles registered globally by the end of December 2020. Global fleet management penetration was estimated to be around 18.6%. ABI forecasts that by 2026, the number of registered commercial vehicles will be approximately 304 million.
In addition to the growing market opportunity in commercial fleet vehicles, we believe there is a large and under-penetrated market to provide a tailored set of safety and security solutions to non-commercial passenger vehicles. Worldwide, the pool of motor vehicles is large and growing, particularly in developing markets. We estimate that there are approximately 7.8 million non-commercial passenger vehicles in operation in South Africa, as of August 2020, utilizing latest vehicle population information available from the National Traffic Information Systems. We believe the potential rate of consumer adoption of mobile asset management solutions is highest in developing regions where vehicle tracking and monitoring features can help to improve driver and passenger safety, reduce the impact of theft by improving stolen vehicle recovery rates and reduce consumer automotive insurance rates.

Installation of our solutions in our customers’ vehicles is generally provided by us or our third-party network, which includes dealers and distributors and installation partners. Customer care and technical support services are provided by our offices in Australia, Brazil, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Romania and the United States. In many cases, our dealers and distributors also provide customers with tier-one customer support services. Our regional offices and dealers and distributors are, in turn, supported by our central technical support team in South Africa that handles any escalated issues. Existing customers can also access customer and technical support directly through our web or mobile applications. Our technical support department is composed of a team of highly skilled staff who are familiar with all of our products, including our entire range of software and service solutions as well as our hardware. The MiX Learning Centre is used by staff and customers around the world to undertake online training to learn about new products and enhancements.
We offer warranties of varying duration on our products. Product warranties are predominantly for a one-year period but periods of up to three years are provided in certain geographic locations. Our Beam-e product carries a lifetime warranty (to the extent that the unit remains in the vehicle into which it was installed for the original subscriber). Warranty expenses are not a significant portion of our total costs.
Research and Development
As of March 31, 2022, our development group consists of 165 full-time staff responsible for software, hardware and firmware development and quality assurance. Our primary development group is based in Stellenbosch, South Africa, and we have additional development resources in Johannesburg, South Africa, as well as the United States. Our software development teams employ an agile development methodology, while our engineering teams use traditional waterfall project management methods. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we invested $9.3 million, $7.2 million and $8.8 million, respectively, in research and development.
Our investment in development is core to our business strategy. Our research and development efforts principally involve software development, firmware development, hardware design and related test equipment. Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. In addition, we have enhanced certain of our hardware components to extend their functionality and reduce component and manufacturing costs.
We have been successful in expanding our product offerings over time, mostly through internal development for which we own all Intellectual Property. Highlights from the fiscal year 2022 include:
•The deployment of 21system-wide platform updates and 29 mobile app updates to our live environments;
•The implementation of a new data lake underpinning a new embedded dashboard and analytics platform for premium fleet customers;
•Updates on all our hardware platforms: MiX2000, MiX4000 & MiX6000 and Beame;
•Launch of our MiX OEM Connect solution to leverage telematics services provided by Original Equipment Manufacturers (truck makers); 
•Launch of MiX Vision AI solution; and
•Development of Canadian ELD solution which will be released in calendar 2022.
Our Devops and SaaS operations are ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 certified with a formalized quality policy and consistent monitoring of internal processes, supplier and solution performance. We outsource all hardware manufacturing to third parties.
Technology
Our solutions are offered using a multi-tenant SaaS architecture that scales rapidly to support additional new subscribers through the addition of incremental data processing and storage capacity. This architecture flexibility allows us to sustain high levels of uptime without degradation of system performance, despite significant subscriber growth. Our existing architecture and infrastructure has been designed with sufficient capacity to meet our current and anticipated future needs. Our subscription-based fleet and consumer service offerings are designed to be accessible via a standard web browser or mobile device application.
Our solutions typically include a proprietary in-vehicle device that incorporates off-the-shelf components, generally including a cellular modem, GPS receiver and memory capacity sufficient to run our firmware, which gathers vehicle location, time, speed, ignition status, miles driven and various vehicle and driver statistics. This information is collected at a predefined 
frequency and then sent to our receivers at secure third-party data centers, generally via a commercial cellular network. The information is then processed and delivered to our customers through our web-based and mobile device applications. Our solutions enable our fleet customers to access large volumes of historical and real-time data, monitor the location and status of their fleet vehicles and drivers, view a wide selection of reports and key performance indicator dashboards and generate valuable, actionable business intelligence.
We store data, host our solutions and serve all of our customers from third-party data centers located in Algiers in Algeria, Sydney in Australia, Muscat in Oman, Dublin in Ireland, and Virginia in the United States. In addition to data hosted at third party data centers, the vast majority of our cloud-based SaaS service leverages Amazon Web Services. Our data management facilities provide us with both physical security, including manned security, biometric access controls and systems security, including firewalls, encryption, redundant power and environmental controls. We believe that our third-party hosting facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional capacity will be available as needed to accommodate planned expansion of our operations.
Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely to a limited extent on patent, trademark and copyright law. A patent covering certain aspects of our Beam-e product was issued in South Africa during fiscal year 2014 and a patent covering a method for driver verification was issued during fiscal year 2015. A further patent for an asset tracking system and method was issued in Brazil during fiscal year 2022.
We typically enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees and independent consultants and other advisors. We also seek these protective agreements from some of our suppliers and subcontractors who have access to sensitive information regarding our intellectual property.
Competition
The rapidly evolving market for our solutions is competitive and highly fragmented, particularly by geography and customer segment. We currently compete with numerous providers of fleet and mobile asset management solutions that range from small, regional providers to midsized multinational providers, such as Teletrac Navman and Geotab, to large global providers, such as Trimble, Omnitracs and Samsara. While we currently only compete with Trimble and Omnitracs on a limited basis, these two competitors are well established companies with significantly greater financial and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors offer fleet or mobile asset management software solutions to particular industry segments or in limited geographic regions. For example, we compete with Microlise and Michelin (Masternaut) in Europe, in the US we compete with Geotab and Samsara, in South Africa we compete with Netstar and Ctrack, Tracker and Cartrack for consumer and small fleet mobile asset management deployments in South Africa, respectively.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•functionality and reliability;
•total cost of ownership;
•breadth and depth of application functionality for fleet deployments;
•product performance;
•interoperability;
•brand and reputation;
•customer service;
•distribution channels, including a global footprint and the ability to service multinationals; 
•regional geographic expertise including localized language support and support for applicable government regulations;
•size of customer base and reference accounts within key industry segments;
•ability to deliver ongoing value and return on investment; 
•ease of deployment and ease of use;
•relevant industry domain expertise and functionality; and
•the financial resources of the vendor.
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors.

Government Regulation
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to our business operations, including laws applicable to providers of Internet and mobile services both domestically and internationally, as we collect data, including personal data, disseminate data and, in some cases, sell data. The application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, marketing, advertising, inadvertent disclosure and consumer protection in many instances is unclear or unsettled.
The transmission of data over the Internet and cellular networks is a critical component of our SaaS business model. Additionally, as cloud computing continues to evolve, increased regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely, particularly in the areas of data privacy and data security. In particular, the dynamic regulatory environment in the European Union and the United Kingdom, made more uncertain due to Brexit, is resulting in additional and increasingly complex regulation in these areas and we believe that the similarly dynamic regulatory environment of the United States, will follow suit. New laws governing data privacy and data security will furthermore be enacted in many other regions. Laws governing the solicitation, collection, processing or use of data could impair our ability to manage and report on customer data, which is integral to the delivery of our SaaS solutions. Increased regulation and the expansion of our business and operations globally have required us to devote legal and other resources to address this regulation. We continuously update and will continue to evaluate our group data protection and security policies, charters and procedures, to assist in maintaining data privacy and data security in line with international practices.
Data privacy regulations and applicable laws in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will regulate our ability to use the data we gather from our customers and increase the cost of doing business and could result in claims being brought by our customers or third parties. As discussed below, South Africa, which is currently our largest market, has its own data protection and security law which came into full effect on July 1, 2021.
South African Regulatory Environment
The Protection of Personal Information Act, No. 4 of 2013 (the “POPI Act”) was promulgated into law in South Africa in November 2013 and came into full effect on July 1, 2021. Any failure to comply with the POPI Act may result in a fine not exceeding R10 million and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years, depending on the severity of such failure.
The purpose of the POPI Act is to promote the privacy of data subjects by establishing a legal framework to regulate the processing of personally identifiable information by mandating juristic persons to implement security measures that uphold the data protection principles and ultimately providing redress through the Information Regulator.
The POPI Act’s implementation has had an impact on our data security and business costs, practices and procedures in South Africa. We have, with the assistance of a third-party project specialist, completed a POPI Act implementation project. Data protection principles and integration remain an ongoing business priority; therefore, we are embarking on the implementation of data loss prevention methodologies and initiatives with the support of a third-party security specialist.
Several existing South African statutes regulate electronic communications, including the Electronic Communications Act, No. 36 of 2005 as amended, and the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, No. 25 of 2002, which apply to several aspects of our business. These statutes regulate the generation, communication, production, processing, sending, receiving, recording, retaining, storing, displaying and use of information, document or signature by or in electronic form.
The Private Security Industry Regulation Act, No. 56 of 2001 (the “PSIRA Act”) also applies to our South African business and governs the vehicle recovery industry in South Africa. The PSIRA Act was enacted for the purposes of, inter alia: (i) the achievement and maintenance of a trustworthy and legitimate private security industry which acts in terms of the principles contained in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act No. 108 of 1996, and other applicable law, and is aimed at ensuring that there is greater safety and security in the country and; (ii) to regulate the private security industry and to exercise effective control over the practice of the occupation of security service providers in the public and national interest and the interest of the private security industry itself.
The National Environmental Management: Waste Act, No. 59 of 2008 (the “NEM: WA Act”) applies to producers of electronic waste (“e-waste”). The NEM: WA Act governs the legal reforms regulating the waste management standards, norms and/or practices in order to protect the health and well-being of communities, and the environment. The NEM: WA Act also provides for the creation of integrated waste management and industry waste management schemes. We are a member of electronic Waste Association of South Africa (“e-WASA”) Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) scheme which is a conduit in fulfilling the obligations under the regulations and ensuring the environmentally sound management of e-waste. The scheme also responds to the socio-economic challenges and opportunities arising from high volumes of e-waste such as job creation, skills development as set out in the National Development Scheme and Sustainable Development Goals.
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
 The South African government established a legislative framework for the promotion of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (“B-BBEE”). Achievement of B-BBEE objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting for the various components of B-BBEE which relates to Ownership, Management Control, Skills Development, Enterprise and Supplier Development (including Preferential Procurement) and Socio-Economic Development. The B-BBEE codes have a continuous review process which resulted in new B-BBEE Codes coming into effect on May 1, 2015, with more onerous compliance requirements, and proposed amendments. In addition, 2018 was a very active year in terms of additional proposed and actual changes to the Revised Codes of Good Practice (“RCoGP”) which were published by the DTI for public comment. In March 2018 the DTI gazetted the Youth Employment Service (“Y.E.S”) initiative as well as proposals on some changes to the Skills Development scorecard. The Y.E.S. Initiative was promulgated on August 28, 2018 by Minister Dr. Rob Davies and amongst others provide opportunities to corporates to improve their B-BBEE contributor level by virtue of participation in the Y.E.S. Initiative. Amendments to the RCoGP were also signed by the Minister of Trade and Industry on May 31, 2019 for implementation on December 1, 2019. These have an impact on the Skills Development and Enterprise and Supplier Development (including Preferential Procurement) pillars. In addition, some definitions and interpretations were further clarified and a few General Principles amended. Since 2019, we have seen minor amendments which speak mainly to interpretation and clarification of the application of the Codes.
It is important for us to achieve applicable B-BBEE objectives to ensure sustainability and contribute towards the realization of the National Development Plan 2030. In addition, B-BBEE objectives are pursued, in significant part, by requiring parties who contract with corporate, governmental and State Owned Enterprises in South Africa to achieve B-BBEE compliance through satisfaction of an applicable scorecard. Parties improve their B-BBEE contributor level when contracting with businesses that have earned good B-BBEE contributor levels in relation to their scorecards. In 2019 the Minister of Labor also declared his intention to promulgate Section 53 of the Employment Equity Act (“EE Act”) which means that every employer that makes an offer to conclude an agreement with any Organ of State for the furnishing of supplies or services to that Organ of State must comply to certain chapters of the EE Act and attach to the offer either a certificate proving compliance with the relevant Chapters of the EE Act; or a declaration by the employer that it complies with the relevant Chapters of the EE Act which when verified by the Director-General is conclusive evidence of compliance. 
We have three material end-customers, which require MiX Telematics Enterprise SA Proprietary Limited to maintain at least a B-BBEE contributor level 3 as measured under the new B-BBEE Codes in addition to at least one requiring additional commitments in terms of Skills Development and Sub-Contracting of at least 30% of the contract value to a Small Black Owned Supplier. The value of these contracts represented 2.9% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2022. MiX Telematics Enterprise SA Proprietary Limited has attained the agreed compliance targets in fiscal year 2022 and furthermore has maintained not only their position on the scorecard to the highest level possible but also its Black ownership in particular that of Black Women following the conclusion of the sales of assets (properties) as allowed for in the B-BBEE Codes. Failing to achieve applicable B-BBEE objectives could jeopardize our ability to maintain existing business or to secure future business from corporate, governmental or State Owned Enterprises that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
U.S. Regulatory Environment
In addition to its regulation of Internet and, by extension, many SaaS providers, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), has been asked by consumer groups to identify practices that may compromise privacy and consumer welfare; examine opt-in procedures to ensure consumers are aware of the type of data being collected and how it will be used; and create policies to halt abusive practices. The FTC has expressed interest in particular in the mobile environment and services that collect sensitive data, such as location-based information, which could conceivably be expanded to include transceiver products such as our in-vehicle devices. Although much of the FTC’s focus is on consumer protection, to the extent that our clients use our systems to monitor employee movement, the FTC may assert jurisdiction. In addition to FTC scrutiny on the consumer side, many fleet drivers in the U.S. may belong to a union, which triggers some degree of oversight from the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”). The NLRB has taken increasing notice of the privacy rights on unionized employees, and future NLRB rules could affect our business model or the way in which our corporate clients use our solutions.
Our business is affected by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. In recent years, regulation has focused on the collection, use, processing, disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, such as a name, address, email address, geolocation, biometric information, and/or professional or employment-related information (“personal information” or “personal data”). While several states are considering and/or have recently passed new privacy legislation, California was the first state to enact its own privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA is applicable to certain businesses that collect personal information about California residents, requiring businesses to provide privacy notices to individuals and enhanced consumer rights (e.g., consumers may request deletion of, access to, or a copy of their personal information, as well as opt-out of the sale of their personal information). However, the CCPA carves out a B2B exemption so that most of its requirements do not apply to the personal information of employees or applicants held by the employing entity and used only to administer the employment relationship or applicant process; currently, the B2B exemption expires on January 1, 2023. The CCPA also creates a private right of action and statutory damages of $100-750 per violation in the event of data breach of unencrypted or “un-redacted” personal information, if the company does not have “reasonable” security. In addition, the California Attorney General has enforcement power and may issue penalties of up to $2,500 ($7,500 if intentional) per violation.
The California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which amends the CCPA, will take effect on January 1, 2023. Most notably, under the CPRA, the definition of “personal information” is expanded to include “sensitive personal information” which includes government identifiers, account and login information, precise geolocation data, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership, contents of mail, email and text messages, genetic data, and certain sexual orientation, health and biometric information. If collected, certain notices and choices to limit the use of sensitive personal information must be provided to consumers.
Virginia became the second state to enact its own privacy law, the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (the “VCDPA”) which will become effective on January 1, 2023. The VCDPA is applicable to certain businesses that collect personal data about Virginia residents, requiring businesses to provide privacy notices to individuals and enhanced consumer rights (e.g., consumers may request confirmation that their personal data is processed and opt out of targeted ads, sales of their personal data, and profiling, as well as request correction of, deletion of, and a copy of their personal data). The definition of “personal data” also includes “sensitive data” which includes precise geolocation data. If collected, businesses must obtain prior consent to process a consumer’s sensitive data. While there is no private right of action under the VCDPA, the Virginia Attorney General may issue fines for the failure to cure a violation after notice of up to $7,500 per violation. That said, the VCDPA does not apply to individuals acting in an employee or B2B context.
Other states, including Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have recently passed similar privacy laws requiring businesses to provide privacy notices and enhanced consumer rights to residents. Failure to comply with privacy laws could result in penalties. The Colorado Privacy Act is effective on July 1, 2023; the Utah Consumer Privacy Act is effective on December 1, 2023; and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act is effective on July 1, 2023. Please note that like the VCDPA, these privacy laws do not apply to individuals acting in an employee or B2B context.
These state privacy laws may apply to mobile and Internet advertising privacy practices, depending on whether or not there is a sale or sharing of personal information pursuant to these laws, as well as if the information collected, used, disclosed, or otherwise processed is considered “sensitive personal information.” In addition to the potential risks imposed by state privacy laws, the FTC has conducted numerous related discussions and suggested that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate, possibly including regulation of non-personally identifiable information which could, with other information, be used to identify an individual. The commercial use of our mobile technology may reduce exposure to FTC regulation and enforcement, but geo-location and similar services are receiving increased regulatory interest and as such may affect how we conduct our business in the future.
Some U.S. state privacy laws have also adopted data minimization principles. For instance, under the CPRA, collection, use, retention, and sharing of a consumer’s personal information must be “reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the personal information was collected or processed.” Further, personal information and sensitive personal data information (which includes geolocation) may not be retained “for longer than is reasonably necessary.”
In addition, several U.S. state laws require data owners to implement reasonable security measures to protect the personal data collected from residents. These laws generally require a data owner to implement reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information, and to protect the personal data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. Although most of these state laws generally require an entity to maintain appropriate security, at least one state (Massachusetts) has adopted comprehensive data privacy requirements to protect personal data. However, these regulations only apply to more sensitive data, such as driver’s license number, Social Security number, and other government identifiers, as well as financial account and credit card number. California was the first state to enact an Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity law, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The law requires manufacturers of any internet-connected devices to equip them with “reasonable” security features that are: appropriate for the nature and function of the device; appropriate for the information it may collect, contain, or transmit; and designed to protect the device and any information contained within the device from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. While there is no private right of action, this law may subject us to potential governmental enforcement actions for noncompliance.
Finally, we use GPS satellites to obtain location data for our in-vehicle devices. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, which does not currently impose additional laws and/or regulations on the ability to access location data. We cannot assure that it will not do so in the future. Any regulatory hurdles could impede the functionality and/or cost of our solutions, which could adversely affect our business. The communication systems that we use to host and transmit data may be subject to security incidents, which may also subject the Company to regulatory enforcement and client pressures.
European Union Regulatory Environment
We are subject to regulation under the laws of the European Union. Of particular relevance with regard to the regulation of our solutions are matters of data protection and privacy. More broadly, any processing of personal data in the course of the provision of services is governed by the European Union data protection regime. The framework legislation at a European Union level in respect of data protection, Directive 95/46/EC, was superseded by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), effective May 25, 2018. In addition, local State data protection and privacy laws apply as well. Some of these place obligations additional to the GDPR on organizations operating in the European Union, such as express suppression of positioning and speeding data when vehicles are used for private trips. The GDPR creates a single legal framework that applies across all EU member states, and in some circumstances, to processors in a state outside of the European Union where this activity affected EU citizens. The GDPR has compliance obligations for data controllers and data processors (we regard our solutions as falling within the processor obligations, on behalf of our customers, the controller). National Data Protection Authorities (“NDPAs”) are able to impose fines for violations ranging from 2% to 4% of annual worldwide turnover, or 10 million to 20 million Euro, whichever is greater. NDPAs have the power to carry out audits, request information, obtain access to premises and compel implementation of specific business practices where there are compliance concerns and risks. Data controllers must be able to demonstrate that the personal data of any data subject can be lawfully processed on one of the six specified grounds, and flow down compliance obligations onto a processor. 
The GDPR adopts a risk-based approach to compliance, under which controllers and processors bear responsibility for assessing the degree of risk that their processing activities pose to data subjects. A controller may be required to perform data 
protection impact assessments before any processing that uses new technology and is likely to result in a high risk to data subjects. The GDPR requires controllers and processors to maintain records of their processing activities, and deal with a data security breach in a specific manner. Under the GDPR, data subjects have specific rights in certain circumstances, for example, the right to request that businesses delete their personal data (the right to be forgotten); to object to their personal data being processed; and to obtain a copy of their personal data within a set time frame.
Data flows within the European Union are not restricted, but some data out flows from the European Union are subject to restrictions to ensure an adequate protection for EU citizen’s personal data.
United Kingdom Regulatory Environment
As a result of its departure from the European Union, the United Kingdom is no longer subject to the EU GDPR framework. In the United Kingdom, data protection is governed by the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR (which adopts the EU GDPR and procedures as at December 31, 2020 only) into UK law. At present, the United Kingdom and European Union regimes are similar. The UK framework places equivalent obligations on controllers and processors to those set out in the EU GDPR, including obligations on controllers to ensure lawful grounds for processing data, adequate security measures are in place to secure it, and equivalent rights are available to UK citizens to protect their personal data. However, the UK Government has stated an intent to reform data protection law in the future.
Cross-border Data Flows between the United Kingdom and the European Union
As a non-EU member state, the United Kingdom falls outside the free-data flow area between EU member states. 
The UK Information Commissioner (as regulator instead of NDPAs) has recognized data transfers from the United Kingdom into the European Union as lawful, on the grounds that the EU GDPR offers “adequate and equivalent protection” for personal data. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the United Kingdom, meaning that personal data can continue to flow freely from the EU’s Member States to the United Kingdom, and the EU will consider such personal data to enjoy an ‘essentially equivalent’ level of protection to that under the EU GDPR.
Australian Regulatory Environment
The Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act of 1988 (the “Privacy Act”) regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and security of personal information. Personal information is defined as “information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not or is recorded in a material form or not”. Personal information includes location-based information where the information enables the location of an individual to be ascertained. Australian privacy laws in general prohibit the transfer of personal information outside Australia unless an exemption applies, such as the individual to whom the information relates has consented to the transfer. In some circumstances, the disclosure will be permissible if there is a data transfer agreement in place between the transferor and the transferee under which the transferee agrees to handle the information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles. Subject to a few exemptions, the Australian Privacy Principles require the transferor to take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that an overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles and the transferor may be held responsible for any breaches of Australian privacy laws when personal information is transferred outside Australia, regardless of whether there is a data transfer agreement in place.
The Notifiable Data Breach (“NDB”) scheme requires companies to notify individuals whose personal information is involved in a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm and includes recommendations about steps individuals should take in response to the breach.
History and development of the Company

MiX Telematics Limited is a public company incorporated in the Republic of South Africa. Our principal executive office is located at 750 Park of Commerce Blvd., Suite 100, Boca Raton, Florida 33487. Our telephone number is +1-877-585-1088, and our web address is www.mixtelematics.com. We are regarded as being primary listed on the JSE and categorized as a domestic filer with regard to our ADSs on the NYSE.
We were founded in 1996 in Johannesburg, South Africa as Matrix Vehicle Tracking Proprietary Limited, and since that time, we have grown both organically and through acquisitions. Matrix Vehicle Tracking Proprietary Limited was renamed TeliMatrix Proprietary Limited in 2001, TeliMatrix Limited in 2007 and finally MiX Telematics Limited in 2008, subsequent to our listing on the JSE.
In 2007, we acquired Control Instruments OmniBridge Proprietary Limited and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “OmniBridge”), which provided fleet management services in both the South African and international markets. In November 2007, we listed our shares on the JSE, in order to facilitate the OmniBridge acquisition. In 2008, we acquired Tripmaster Corporation, located in the United States, Safe Drive (including Safe Drive International Proprietary Limited), located in Australia and Safe Drive FZE, located in the United Arab Emirates. These acquisitions extended our geographic reach, broadened our customer relationships and expanded our driver safety and training solution offerings. In May 2012, we acquired Intellichain, located in South Africa, as part of our strategy to broaden our transportation management software functionality. On August 9, 2013, following a successful United States IPO, the Company’s ADSs were listed on the NYSE and are traded under the symbol MIXT. In December 2013, we acquired a proprietary software development business from Roitech Proprietary Limited, located in South Africa. The acquisition enhanced and broadened our fleet management smart phone application offerings. On November 1, 2014, we acquired the operating business of Compass Fleet Management (“Compass”), a South Africa based provider of specialized fleet management solutions in Southern Africa, that are delivered using the Company’s hardware and software platforms. These specialized fleet management solutions complement the Company’s existing fleet management solutions, and the acquisition broadens the array of services offered to current and future fleet management customers.
