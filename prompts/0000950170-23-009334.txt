 Item 1. Business.
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel, oral, once-daily therapeutics for patients with certain immunology diseases. Our core expertise is the clinical development of compounds that target novel pathways at the interface of immunity and metabolism. Based on our understanding of the role that cellular metabolic pathways have on modulating inflammatory responses, we aim to inhibit these inflammatory responses by changing the metabolic processes in target cells. We believe the therapeutics we develop, if approved, could have a significant positive impact on the quality of life of patients suffering from immunology diseases.
Our current focus and lead candidate is NX-13, a novel, oral, gut-selective NLRX1 agonist. We are developing NX-13 as a once-daily oral treatment for ulcerative colitis, or UC, that targets NOD-like receptor X1, or NLRX1, a mitochondria-associated receptor that has been associated with the modulation of inflammatory cytokines for UC. NX-13 is designed to target NLRX1 and induce anti-inflammatory effects in CD4+ T cells and other cells in the gastrointestinal tract.
 We announced top-line results from our NX-13 Phase 1b trial in UC patients in August 2022. The data showed favorable safety and tolerability profiles across a range of doses, as well as signals of clinical improvement as soon as two weeks in patients’ symptoms and four weeks by endoscopy in exploratory endpoints. We believe that these early signals, as well as the data from long-term toxicology studies, support the potential of NX-13 as a new treatment for UC. We are continuing an in-depth analysis of the clinical, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamic, or PD, data for NX-13. A preliminary analysis demonstrated promising signals of both target engagement and molecular dose response among the 250mg and 500mg immediate release, or IR, doses. We will be conducting a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for NX-13, which will be dose ranging, blinded, placebo-controlled and statistically powered. We are on track for first site activation and patient enrollment for the NX-13 Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2023, and we expect to report top-line data from this trial by the fourth quarter of 2024.
 In addition to NX-13, we have discovered several preclinical product candidates, comprising the following:
•LABP-73, an oral, small molecule NLRX1 pathway agonist in development for the treatment of asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD, 
 •LABP-66, an oral, small molecule NLRX1 pathway agonist in development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, or MS, and Alzheimer’s disease; and 
 •LABP-69, an oral, small molecule PLXDC2 pathway agonist in development for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and rheumatoid arthritis, or RA.
 Recent Events
 In January 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the Securities Purchase Agreement, with the institutional accredited investors named therein, or the Investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Investors in a private placement, or the Private Placement, pre-funded warrants, or the Pre-Funded Warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 30,909,090 shares, or the Warrant Shares, of our common stock. Each Pre-Funded Warrant has an exercise price of $0.01 per Warrant Share. The purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant was $0.54. The Pre-Funded Warrants issued in the Private Placement provide that the holder of the Pre-Funded Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of its Pre-Funded Warrants if such holder, together with its affiliates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership of common stock would be aggregated with the holder for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, would beneficially own in excess of 35% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The Warrant Shares will also be subject to certain registration rights under the Company’s Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement. The Private Placement closed on January 10, 2023. Gross proceeds of the Private Placement were approximately $16.7 million, before deducting offering expenses payable by us.
 

In February 2023, we entered into an asset purchase and redemption agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Dr. Bassaganya-Riera, Raquel Hontecillas and certain other stockholders, or together the Purchasers, whereby the Purchasers acquired (i) all of our right, title and interest in omilancor, LABP-104 and LABP-111 and any such derivatives and analogs that target LANCL proteins, or together the Acquired Compounds, (ii) a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid up, royalty-free, exclusive, sublicensable and transferable license grant under the intellectual property rights retained by us and necessary or useful for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the Acquired Compounds, (iii) a royalty agreement providing, among other things, for the payment by us to the Purchasers of a royalty of 2% of all net sales by us of any products containing certain compounds that we will retain following the closing under the Purchase Agreement and (iv) $3,000,000 in cash in exchange for (x) 9,086,441 shares of our common stock held by the Purchasers and (y) a royalty agreement providing, among other things, for the payment by the Purchasers to us a royalty of 6% of all net sales by the Purchasers of any products containing any of the Acquired Compounds in consideration for the acquired intellectual property rights. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement closed simultaneously with signing.
 In May 2021, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement, or the LianBio Agreement, with LianBio Respiratory Limited, or Lian, pursuant to which we granted Lian an exclusive license, or the License, to develop, manufacture and commercialize NX-13 and omilancor. In February 2023, we amended the LianBio Agreement to no longer cover the licensing of Licensed Technology relating to omilancor and developmental milestones events were amended to reflect the transfer of Licensed Technology relating to omilancor. Subsequent to the amendment, we are eligible to receive development milestone payments of up to $40.0 million as well as sales milestone payments of up to $105.0 million. We are also eligible to receive tiered low-double-digit royalties based on future net sales of NX-13 in the Territory, subject to reductions in specified circumstances.
 Background in Autoimmune Diseases
Autoimmune diseases generally result from the loss of self-tolerance in the immune system, causing the immune system to attack healthy organs and tissues. This leads to inflammation of the organs and tissues, causing chronic pain and deterioration or destruction of organ function. Current therapies either broadly prevent the immune system from functioning, in the case of corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, or 5-ASA, and immunosuppressants, or systemically block specific molecules that promote inflammation in the case of biologics, S1P receptor modulators and JAK inhibitors. Existing approaches continue to leave unmet patient need.
 Our Approach
Our mission is to create safe and effective oral medicines to engage novel targets in therapeutic areas of unmet medical need where current treatments have limited efficacy or safety and tolerability concerns. To achieve this mission, we are developing novel, oral therapeutic candidates that are designed to address the therapeutic gap in the current treatment paradigm for immunology diseases.
Our Strengths
 Our distinctive strengths include:
 •We have a strong team of experienced executive leaders and drug developers. We have created a team of experienced drug developers with deep experience in the clinical development of autoimmune drug compounds.
 •We are pioneering a new paradigm in immunometabolism based on novel pathways. We have identified novel immunometabolic targets or pathways that may provide upstream control of established inflammatory and regulatory pathways and have created novel programs to target these pathways. 
 •We have discovered several preclinical and clinical-stage assets across the NLRX1 and PLXDC2 pathways. Currently in our portfolio, we have four product candidates, which target two novel immunometabolic targets. We have progressed NX-13, which targets NLRX1, into the clinic. 
 

•We are developing a product candidate with a novel mechanism of action, or MOA, to address therapeutic gaps for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, where current treatments have limited efficacy or safety and tolerability concerns. We believe we are the only company targeting the NLRX1 pathway for IBD. NLRX1 has been associated with the modulation of inflammatory cytokines for UC. NX-13 is designed to target NLRX1 and induce anti-inflammatory effects in CD4+ T cells and other immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract. We believe targeting this pathway may confer a unique advantage for faster onset and longer maintenance of clinical remission and reduction of the high flare rates in IBD patients. NX-13 is designed as a convenient, once-daily, oral therapeutic, which we believe may provide efficacy, safety and competitive advantages over currently available injectable, systemically distributed biologics and other oral therapeutics.
 •We are targeting several indications characterized by unmet medical need and therapeutic gaps that represent a broad market opportunity. Based on clinical and preclinical data, we believe our product candidates, if approved, have the potential to address large therapeutic markets and specific therapeutic gaps in both UC and other immunology diseases. 
 •We have a strong intellectual property foundation. Our intellectual property portfolio includes composition of matter and method of use patents and patent applications covering NX-13 and each of our preclinical assets. The patent protection for these product candidates extends to 2039 for NX-13. Subsequent to the Purchase Agreement, our intellectual property portfolio includes more than 24 issued patents and 18 pending patent applications.
 
Our Strategy
 We believe that we are uniquely positioned to identify and develop potentially safer and more effective novel, oral therapeutics for a range of immunology diseases. Our strategy consists of the following key components:
 •Continue development of NX-13. We are focused on the successful advancement of our innovative pipeline of multiple pathways and programs with novel mechanisms of action. Our current and primary focus is the clinical development of NX-13.
 •Maximize the value of our entire pipeline. Other than those rights licensed to Lian for NX-13, we have retained worldwide development and commercial rights to all of our therapeutic programs. We believe our broader, novel pipeline has significant optionality and is poised for partnering and continued development in the future. As such, we may continue to pursue development and commercialization collaborations for our clinical and preclinical programs. 
Background on Immunometabolism
 The field of immunometabolism describes the interplay and dual action of a number of enzymes, receptors, signaling molecules and substrates which have effects on both cellular metabolism and immune function. First, we have come to understand that alterations in the concentration of metabolic enzymes, substrates and products in the cell serve as messengers to trigger inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases. The reverse is also true; immunology receptors transmit information about the environment through pathways that affect the metabolic profile of the cell to provide the cellular energy necessary for a specific behavior (e.g., an inflammatory response) to protect the organism. These metabolic processes are critical determinants of the function of immune cells. For example, pro-inflammatory effector Th1 and Th17 have a metabolic preference for glycolytic pathways whereas anti-inflammatory Treg cells prefer oxidative phosphorylation to produce energy. By targeting these immunometabolic hubs and shifting metabolism to oxidative from glycolytic metabolic pathways, there is a functional switch in immune cells that promotes regulatory functions.


Genes with inflammatory functions, such as TNF or IL-6, tend to be overexpressed during autoimmune responses and are easily identified due to the degree of their upregulation. The metabolic pathways of immune cells must also be configured to meet the demands of their function. However, even modest changes in genes with immunometabolic roles can be sufficient and critical in modulating inflammation. By altering the signals that drive differentiation and the metabolic pathways that support it, immune tolerance can be reestablished in patients where there is immune dysregulation, such as in autoimmune disease.
 While critical to functions in immune cells, immunometabolic targets are also expressed in a wide range of mesenchymal- and epithelial-derived cells throughout the body. The effects within these cell types often mirror the described signaling events within Tregs, whereby the promotion of mitochondrial metabolism disfavors hyper-inflamed or hyper-proliferative states. In IBD, mitochondrial metabolism pathways account for the majority of downregulated genes relative to healthy controls, evidence of the hyper-inflammatory demands of the inflamed colon which is reliant on glycolytic pathways.
 When mitochondrial metabolism restoration is achieved, chemokine production from intestinal epithelial cells is decreased, leading to suppression of neutrophil recruitment into the intestinal wall. In IBD, neutrophils are crucial histological markers of active disease as well as the primary source for calprotectin, a highly predictive fecal biomarker of response to treatment since the majority of drugs approved for treating IBD cause a drop in fecal calprotectin concentrations.
 We are focused on developing novel oral therapeutics based on activating molecular targets within certain immunometabolic pathways to rebalance the effector and regulatory branches of the immune system. The imbalance of these two sides, resulting in aberrant inflammation against self-targets, is responsible for many autoimmune diseases. Our proprietary advanced artificial intelligence-based integrated computational and experimental precision medicine platform was used for efficient identification, segregation, and prioritization of these genes, described below, from high throughput datasets.
 Our NLRX1 Pathway Product Candidates
 The NLRX1 Pathway
We believe the mitochondrial associated receptor, NLRX1 (Nucleotide Oligomerization Domain, or NOD,-Like Receptor X 1), is favorably positioned to induce both metabolic and immunological effects. NLRX1 is unique among the family of NOD-Like Receptors, or NLRs, as one of three to primarily induce regulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. NLRs are pattern-recognition receptors, which are part of the environmental surveillance system detecting bacterial, viral and other foreign components. The most commonly studied NLRs are those associated with the inflammasome, a complex whose activation results in high levels of cytokine production and cell death that further increases inflammation. Polymorphisms in NLRP1, NLRP3, and other inflammasome associated NLRs, as well as inflammasome overactivity, are commonly identified in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. NLRX1 is the natural counterbalance to this process, serving to control and negatively regulate many of the processes induced by inflammasome activation.
 NLRX1 has neither well-characterized nor prominent genetic mutations that would inhibit its activation by our compounds. NLRX1 regulates oxidative metabolism while also providing a mechanism to counteract the inflammatory potential of the resultant reactive oxygen species, or ROS. Through effects on c-Abl and Nrf2, NLRX1 activates expression of enzymes to increase intracellular antioxidant capacity, neutralizing ROS. The net downregulation of intracellular ROS and lactate production decreases NF-κB activity, a main signaling element upstream of many inflammatory cytokines. As a result, NLRX1 activation decreases a wide range of cytokines from both CD4+ T cell, myeloid, and non-immune cells.

NLRX1 Multimodal Mechanism of Action•Increase mitochondrial metabolism•Decrease cellular reactive oxygen species•Downregulate cytokines like TNF and IFNγ (via antagonism of NF-kB)•Decrease inflammasome formation (NLRP1 and NLRP3)•Decrease differentiation of effector CD4+ T cells

 

At the cellular level, NLRX1 activation results a rebalance in CD4+ T cell subsets, decreased activation of macrophages and decreased stress-induced cell death for epithelial and other specialized cells. The decrease in lactate production and NF-κB activity results in proportionally lower Th17 cells relative to Treg cells with NLRX1 activation. Similarly, decreased NF-κB prevents polarization of macrophages into inflammatory subsets, favoring those associated with tissue repair and homeostasis. Additionally, NLRX1-associated ubiquitination of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein, or MAVS, is thought to contribute to decreased macrophage activation. In intestinal epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells and neurons, NLRX1 activation increases mitochondrial metabolism and prevents oxidative stress. These effects are beneficial to functions of these cell types, including cell survival, the maintenance of barrier integrity and expression of tight junction proteins. In addition, the added metabolic support favors apoptosis, a relatively silent form of cell death. NLRX1 can aid in the tissue homeostasis and repair processes to prevent chronic tissue damage and fibrosis.
 Our lead product candidate targeting the NLRX1 pathway is NX-13 in development for UC.
 Background on Ulcerative Colitis
 Overview
UC is a chronic immunology disease with significant therapeutic gaps resulting from the safety issues, modest efficacy, loss of clinical response time, and dosing administration of current treatment options. We believe that an oral, once-daily, gut-selective small molecule that maintains safety and efficacy could address the therapeutic gaps in the UC treatment paradigm and have a significant positive impact on quality of life for UC patients.
Background on UC and Current Treatments
UC is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation, irritation, and ulcers in the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Symptoms include abdominal pain, rectal pain and bleeding, bloody stools, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and malnutrition. Having UC puts a patient at increased risk of developing colon cancer. Diagnosis typically occurs in early adulthood and the disease requires maintenance treatment for the remainder of the patient’s life. UC is estimated to affect over one million patients in the U.S. and over one million patients throughout the rest of the world.
 Patients with UC are classified into mild-to-moderate, comprising 40% of patients, and moderate-to-severe, comprising 60% of patients, based on the level of symptoms experienced. Accordingly, the current therapeutic treatments for UC depend on the severity of the disease and are broadly divided into six classes:
Mild to Moderate UC
The following treatments are typically used in the treatment of mild to moderate UC:
•5-ASA's (mesalamine, sulfasalazine) are used as a first-line anti-inflammatory therapy in UC although the precise mechanism of action is not known. Many also require corticosteroids (see below) to address disease flares and eventually lose response to both drugs progressing to the use of immunosuppressants, biologics, or small molecule advanced therapies. Aminosalicylates are commonly preferred by physicians and patients for the treatment of IBD, due to high tolerability in most patients and their availability as generic oral drugs. Side effects include headache, nausea, dyspepsia, flatulence and diarrhea. Rare but more serious side effects include pleuritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, cholestic hepatitis, nephritis and renal dysfunction. 
 •Corticosteroids (budesonide, prednisone) are used as induction agents and are prescribed for short periods to address disease flares in both mild to moderate and moderate to severe patients. Corticosteroids are generally administered through an oral or rectal route of administration and are available as generic drugs. Common side effects are mild to moderate in intensity and include headache, nausea, mood and sleep changes. Corticosteroids are not considered appropriate for long term use and are therefore not used for maintenance therapy due to the risk for bone loss, weight gain, lowered quality of life and cardiovascular complications. 
 

•Immunosuppressants (methotrexate, thiopurines) are used to wean patients off steroid use and rarely as independent maintenance drugs in moderate to severe patients. Immunosuppressants are orally-administered, systemically-distributed agents and are available as generic drugs. Common side effects include a decrease in the number of white blood cells (leucopenia), headache, rash, nausea, and dyspepsia, alopecia, mild increase in levels of liver enzymes, peritoneal abscesses, and abnormally low levels of the protein albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia). 
 Moderate to Severe UC
The following treatments are typically used in the treatment of moderate to severe UC:
•Biologics (anti-TNF, anti-IL-12/IL-23, anti-integrin) are the primary maintenance therapy in moderate to severe UC. Biologics are injectable therapies and can be divided into two classes: those targeting cytokines and those targeting cell trafficking. Side effects include leucopenia, immunosuppression, cancer, infection, and death.
 •S1P Receptor modulators (ozanimod) are an induction and maintenance therapy for moderate to severe patients that do not respond to other therapies. Similar to immunosuppressants, approved S1P modulators are oral agents that are systemically distributed. Common side effects of S1P modulators include upper respiratory infection, mild increase in levels of liver enzymes, orthostatic hypotension, headache, fever, nausea, arthralgia, hypertension, and increased risk for infections. Rare but serious side effects include serious infections or meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, bradyarrythmia and atrioventricular conduction delays, liver damage, macular edema, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
 •JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upidacitinib) are an induction and maintenance therapy for severe patients that do not respond to other therapies, including biologics. Similar to immunosuppressants, approved JAK inhibitors are oral agents that are systemically distributed. Common side effects of JAK inhibitors include nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, rash, diarrhea, and herpes zoster, mild neutropenia and anemia, and slight increase in the incidence of malignancies (lymphoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer). The FDA has a Black Box warning on the class for severe risks associates with serious infections, mortality, malignancy, major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, and thrombosis. 
 
We believe that current therapeutics for the treatment of both mild to moderate and moderate to severe UC have the following limitations that we believe NX-13 if approved, may address:
•Safety and tolerability concerns. The majority of approved therapeutics for maintenance of moderate to severe UC (biologics and JAK inhibitors) work systemically, requiring high systemic exposures, resulting in effects on the immune system outside of the gastrointestinal tract. These effects result in increased risks for cancers, infections, blood clots and death. Given the chronic nature of UC, we believe there is a need for safer, long-term oral options. Despite a lower severity of disease, many of the mechanisms of action for current drugs in mild-to-moderate space are also tied to known toxicities and risks. 
 •Inconvenient route of administration. The main class of therapy in moderate to severe UC is biologics, which are injectable therapies administered through either intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Often, this requires a patient to visit a clinic or specialty care provider. 5-ASA's, the standard-of-care for mild-to-moderate UC, requires 2.4 to 4.8 grams per day (two to six tablets daily) when dosed orally. Depending on the response to oral dosing, rectal dosing of mesalamine is sometimes required. 


•Therapeutic gap. We believe there is a treatment gap for the vast majority of moderate to severe patients between 5-ASA's failures and biologics use. Patients are faced with the option of staying on a sub-optimal therapy to which they are losing response or moving into classes of treatment with higher safety risks and more inconvenient dosing. The emergence of safety concerns for JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators have limited the use of oral, non-biologic immunomodulators that are currently in development for patients who have failed biologics. We believe there is an unmet need for safer and effective oral drugs that can bridge the treatment gap from 5-ASA's to biologics.
 NX-13, Our Solution for the Treatment of UC
We believe that NX-13, if approved, has the potential to treat patients prior to their progression into biologics and address the main limitations of current therapeutics based on the clinical and preclinical data to date, potentially offering the following advantages:
•Gut-selective PK with low systemic exposure. In preclinical and clinical studies, we observed low systemic exposure with gut-selective exposure in humans.
 •Tolerability. In initial clinical trials, NX-13 was well tolerated, with no differences in presentation of adverse events, or AEs, clinical chemistry, changes in white blood cell counts, electrocardiogram, or ECG, and other clinical measures at doses significantly higher the predicted efficacious dose compared to placebo patients. There have been no serious adverse events in any subjects receiving NX-13 to date.
 •Convenient, once-daily oral dosing.
 •Innovative immunometabolic target not tied to toxicities. We have designed NX-13 to activate a novel target, NLRX1, to induce immunometabolic effects that disfavor effector responses.
 NX-13 Mechanism of Action Overview and Preclinical data
 Mechanistically, the activation of NLRX1 could have multiple benefits in UC with the ability to modulate epithelial integrity, host-microbiome interactions, and mucosal immune responses. As such, we believe NX-13 could provide significant benefits compared to current therapeutics for UC.
The graphics below illustrate key elements of NLRX1 activation by NX-13.
 


NX-13 is designed to target NLRX1 and provide therapeutic efficacy by reducing pro-inflammatory effects in CD4+ T cells and other immune cells of the gastrointestinal tract, to restore immune balance. NLRX1 was identified as an immunometabolic therapeutic target based on loss of function characterization in animal models of IBD in which the loss of NLRX1 increased disease severity and histological lesions, altered CD4+ T cell differentiation, disrupted epithelial barrier integrity, and negatively influenced gut microbial populations. Through the immunometabolic actions of NLRX1 leading to increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased NF-κB activity in CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, NX-13 inhibits the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 subsets and overall immune activation. NX-13 is a gut-selective compound with minimal systemic absorption observed in preclinical and clinical studies.
 As a once-daily, oral, gut-selective molecule, we believe NX-13 has a promising target product profile for the treatment of UC. Early nonclinical and clinical studies of NX-13 have not revealed any dose-limiting toxicities at doses well above the intended range. In preclinical comparative efficacy studies to 5-ASA, anti-TNF, and tofacitinib, we have observed significantly greater changes in disease activity, biomarkers and histological parameters with NX-13.
 Clinical Development of NX-13
 We presented the results of our Phase 1a clinical trial of NX-13 in 56 healthy volunteers in March 2021. The trial met all primary and secondary endpoints, and no serious adverse events were reported at any dose level. The data also demonstrated a signal of immunomodulatory activity in terms of lowering fecal calprotectin levels, increasing IL-10 concentrations, and decreasing IL-6 concentrations in plasma.
 We announced top-line results from our NX-13 Phase 1b trial in 36 UC patients in August 2022. While the trial was not statistically powered (and therefore hypothesis generating only), the treated patients experienced reductions in multiple clinical activity measures after four weeks. The data showed favorable safety and tolerability profiles across a range of doses, as well as signals of rapid clinical improvement as soon as two weeks in patients’ symptoms and four weeks by endoscopy in exploratory endpoints. This early signal, as well as the data from long-term toxicology studies, support the further evaluation of NX-13 as a potential new treatment for UC.
 
We are continuing an in-depth analysis of the clinical, PK and PD data for NX-13. A preliminary analysis showed promising signals of both target engagement and molecular dose response among the 250mg and 500mg immediate release, or IR, doses. We are planning to conduct a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for NX-13, which will be dose ranging, blinded, placebo-controlled, and statistically powered. We are on track for first site activation and patient enrollment for the NX-13 Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2023 and expect to report top-line data from the trial by the fourth quarter of 2024.
 We believe that through NLRX1 activation, NX-13, if approved, may change the treatment paradigm for patients with UC. Despite currently available treatments, there is still a significant unmet need in the treatment of UC. We believe this need can be met by therapies like NX-13, which are designed to provide (1) an oral, once-daily dosing with comparable efficacy to advanced therapies; (2) greater mucosal healing; and (3) improved efficacy and safety for long-term use. We believe that NX-13, with its unique MOA, good tolerability and lack of serious adverse events, once-daily dosing, and promising early clinical data, could, if approved, potentially transform the current treatment paradigm and be positioned for earlier and broader use in moderate-to-severe UC patients.
 

Preclinical Stage Product Candidates
 LABP-69 for the Potential Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Diabetic Nephropathy
 LABP-69 is a small molecule product candidate that targets PLXDC2 that we are developing for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetic nephropathy. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a swelling and loss of mobility in joints caused by excessive inflammation and immune cell infiltration into the joint synovium. Diabetic nephropathy is a main complication in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease.
 LABP-69 aims to increase IL-10 secretion and down regulate pro-inflammatory signals and angiogenesis. Results in two rodent models of RA demonstrate the role of PLXDC2 and the effect of LABP-69 in abrogating disease severity. LABP-69 is designed to activate PLXDC2 in both a broad array of immune cells and non-immune cells, shifting them towards an anti-inflammatory state and compounding its therapeutic effects.
 LABP-66 for the Potential Treatment of MS, Alzheimer’s Disease, and other debilitating CNS diseases
 LABP-66 is an oral, small molecule agonist of the NLRX1 pathway for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis, or MS, Alzheimer’s disease and other inflammatory central nervous system, or CNS, diseases. NLRX1 is a non-inflammasome-forming mitochondrial-associated NLR, expressed by immune cells systemically and in the CNS. NLRX1 activation down-regulates inflammation in animal models of injury and autoimmune diseases, including the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE, model of MS and colitis models of IBD. Progressive MS presents with cortical lesions comprised of activated microglia and an overall increase in microglia in the brain. These microglia, as well as IL-12- and TNF-producing dendritic cells, contribute to direct neuronal damage as well as the ongoing demyelination that disrupts axonal architecture. In multiple EAE models, the loss of NLRX1 results in worsening of disease, greater microglial activation, and increased prevalence of spinal cord lesions.
 NLRX1 activation can protect neurons from oxidative stress and ameliorate CNS inflammation. We believe LABP-66 may represent a novel approach to addressing an unmet clinical need in Alzheimer’s disease and progressive MS, for which no current therapy slows the progression of cognitive decline and neurological damage.
 LABP-73 for the Potential Treatment of Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
 LABP-73 is a small molecule product candidate that systemically targets NLRX1 for the potential treatment of Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. NLRX1 is a mitochondria-associated receptor involved in down-regulating inflammation during bacterial and viral exposure, colitis, MS and chronic pulmonary disease. Asthma encompasses a wide range of allergic and inflammatory diseases. Severe sub-types of asthma, including both neutrophilic and eosinophilic manifestations, lack effective treatment methods. COPD is an inflammatory disease of the lung characterized by chronic bronchitis and emphysema and caused primarily by environmental exposures and cigarette smoke. The current treatments for COPD primarily provide symptomatic relief. We believe that LABP-73, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to improve on the current treatment options by addressing both epithelial and immune dysfunction to resolve neutrophil inflammation, improve pulmonary function and reverse underlying fibrosis.
Manufacturing
 Our drug substance and drug product manufacturing are conducted at third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in India. All of our CMOs hold applicable licenses, certifications and/or approvals for cGMP manufacturing, analytical testing, packaging, and release operations from multiple drug regulation entities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Each manufacturer has also been independently qualified through our own internal qualification processes.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and particularly the market for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel products and product candidates. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies, compounding facilities, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
 We are aware of several other products and product candidates as potential treatments for UC that would compete with NX-13, if approved. In particular, we expect to compete against companies that produce biologic drugs and certain generic products that currently serve the UC market, as well as companies that produce the aminosalicylates, steroids and immunosuppressants that are currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate disease. If approved, NX-13 is expected to compete against companies that produce, or are developing, injectable biologic therapeutics such as AbbVie Inc., Amgen Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly and Co., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Roche Holding Ltd., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. and UCB S.A., as well as companies that produce, or are developing, oral products such as Abivax SA, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Galapagos N.V., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Morphic Therapeutic, Prometheus Therapeutics, Inc., Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., Reistone Biopharma, Roivant Sciences, Ltd., and Salix Pharmaceuticals.
 NX-13 is a differentiated, orally active, therapeutic candidate that we believe is the first to target its pathway. We are not aware of any product candidate targeting the NLRX1 pathways in current clinical development.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than NX-13 or any other product that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.

The patent positions for our product candidates immediately following the Purchase Agreement are summarized below.
 NX-13
 We hold issued patents covering the NX-13 compound and various uses thereof in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and South Korea. Patent applications pursuing coverage of NX-13 are pending in Argentina, Chile, Eurasia, Hong Kong, and India. The issued patents and any patents issuing from the pending applications are projected to expire in 2039, absent any surrendered term, adjustments, or extensions.
 

LABP-69
We hold an issued U.S. patent covering the LABP-69 compound and its use in treating conditions such as diabetic nephropathy and rheumatoid arthritis. We have filed patent applications covering LABP-69 in Argentina, Canada, China, Europe, and Japan. The issued U.S. patent and any patents that may arise from the pending applications are projected to expire in 2041, absent any surrendered term, adjustments, or extensions.
 LABP-66
 We have filed patent applications covering the LABP-66 compound and uses thereof in the U.S., the PCT international patent system, and Argentina. The application in the U.S. has been accepted for issuance. Any patents that may arise from these applications are projected to expire in 2041, absent any surrendered term, adjustments, or extensions.
 LABP-73
 We have filed an application covering the LABP-73 compound and uses thereof in the PCT international patent system. Any patents that may arise from this application are projected to expire in 2042, absent any surrendered term, adjustments, or extensions.
 Intellectual Property Protection
We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Further, any issued patents may expire before the expected expiration dates disclosed above due to actions taken during patent prosecution, such as submission of a disclaimer surrendering the term of a patent beyond a certain date. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. While there are currently no contested proceedings or third-party claims relating to any of the patents or patent applications described above, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not have such proceedings or third-party claims at a later date or once any patent is granted.
The term of a patent depends upon the legal term of patents in the particular country in which it is obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the U.S., the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, which permits in some cases restoration of patent term as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In certain circumstances, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the unextended expiration date of the U.S. patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the approved drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, or provide an additional period of protection for the approved pharmaceutical product following expiry of the patent. In the future, if our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available. There is no guarantee, however, that the applicable authorities, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the U.S. and the national patent offices in Europe or other jurisdictions, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and, if granted, the length of such extensions.


In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates, and research programs, we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential, and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations and practices to protect our trade secrets.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation (in-vitro) of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies (in-vivo) to assess potential safety and efficacy. An Investigational New Drug, or IND, sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND (or equivalent submission ex-US). In addition, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee, or EC, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be provided within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.


Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dose determination and tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 •Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics Licensing Application, or BLA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA/BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.

After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk of evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. Fast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted.
In addition, a sponsor can request breakthrough therapy designation for a drug if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive guidance from FDA on an efficient drug development program, organizational commitment to the development and review of the product including involvement of senior managers, and, like Fast Track products, are also eligible for rolling review of the NDA. Both Fast Track and breakthrough therapy products are also eligible for accelerated approval and/or priority review, if relevant criteria are met.
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.


In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated approval regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
Once an NDA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track breakthrough therapy designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on responding to requests for expanded access. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Orphan Designation
The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the U.S., orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
Post-approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of such products will be covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services by challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the U.S. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process can be a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments, or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA, among other things, imposed a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and expanded the rebate program to include Medicaid managed care organizations. It also contained substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business.
 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurance tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.


Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the Administration’s proposals. The FDA currently recently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, implementing a portion of President Trump’s Executive Order announced on July 24, 2020 that directed the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS to finalize the Canadian drug importation proposed rule previously issued by HHS and make other changes allowing for personal importation of drugs from Canada. The FDA final rule and additional FDA guidance provides pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 until January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for fixed fees to pharmacy benefit managers for certain services rendered to manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation, particularly in light of the recent U.S. presidential election. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
We will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal, state and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business once our products are approved. These fraud and abuse and transparency laws may impact, among other things, our financial arrangements and proposed sales, marketing and education programs.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.


Moreover, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through “qui tam” whistleblower actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Additionally, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
In addition, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as analogous state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), and other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), teaching hospitals as well as information regarding physician ownership and investment interests.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to health care providers and entities. In addition, certain states and local jurisdictions require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Government Regulation Outside of the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Data Privacy and Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, processing, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities as well as their covered subcontractors. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties.
Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.
In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the GDPR govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. In Europe, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the U.S. and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws. Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EEA. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield, under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, following Brexit and the end of the Transition Period, companies will have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which exposes us to further compliance risk.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 22 full-time employees in activities such as research and development, clinical development, finance, and administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
