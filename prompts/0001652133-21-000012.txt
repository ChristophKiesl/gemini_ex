Item 1. Business 
Overview
Oasis Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership,” “OMP,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a premier gathering and processing master limited partnership formed by its sponsor, Oasis Petroleum Inc. (Nasdaq: OAS) (“Oasis Petroleum”), to own, develop, operate and acquire a diversified portfolio of midstream assets in North America. We offer full service midstream solutions to our customers covering their oil, gas and water needs. Our full scale of operations includes natural gas services (gathering, compression, processing and gas lift supply), crude oil services (gathering, terminaling and transportation) and water services (gathering and disposal of produced and flowback water and freshwater distribution). Our current assets are located in the heart of the oil-rich Williston and Permian Basins and are integral to the crude oil and natural gas operations of Oasis Petroleum. Our assets are also strategically positioned to capture volumes from other producers. 
We have significant acreage dedications from Oasis Petroleum and commitments from third party producers in both the Williston and Permian Basins. In the Williston Basin, we divide our operations into two primary areas with developed midstream infrastructure. In Wild Basin, we provide natural gas services (gathering, compression, processing and gas lift supply), crude oil services (gathering, terminaling and transportation), and water services (gathering and disposal of produced and flowback water and freshwater distribution) to our customers. Outside of Wild Basin, we provide water services (gathering and disposal of produced and flowback water and freshwater distribution) to our customers. In the Permian Basin, we operate strategically located infrastructure where we provide crude oil services (gathering) and water services (gathering and disposal of produced and flowback water) to our customers, with connection points to key market hubs.
Contributed Businesses and Organizational Structure

Oasis Petroleum has acreage dedications to third parties for crude oil and natural gas services in the Williston and Permian Basins. On dedicated acreage, if the third party dedication for crude oil and natural gas midstream services lapses on currently dedicated acreage, Oasis Petroleum will have the right to dedicate that acreage to us for such services or to develop crude oil and natural gas midstream assets that would be subject to our right of first offer (“ROFO”) or right of first refusal (“ROFR”), as applicable, in the event Oasis Petroleum elects to sell them. See “Contractual arrangements with Oasis Petroleum — Omnibus Agreement; Subject Assets” for more information about our ROFO and ROFR.
Organizational structure
The following is a simplified diagram of our ownership structure as of December 31, 2020.
Our business strategy
Our business strategy is focused on the following strategic priorities:
Providing services under long-term, fixed-fee contracts to mitigate direct commodity price exposure and enhance the stability of our cash flows. We are party to long-term, fixed-fee contracts with Oasis Petroleum for natural gas services, crude oil services and water services. We are also party to a long-term FERC-regulated transportation services agreement governing the transportation of crude oil via pipeline from the Wild Basin area to Johnson’s Corner. We generate the substantial majority of our revenues through these contracts. Additionally, we have increased our customer diversification in the Williston and Permian Basins by entering into agreements with third parties for natural gas, crude oil and water services, and we continue to pursue long-term, fee-based contracts with third parties to further enhance our customer diversification. We have minimal direct exposure to commodity prices, and we generally do not take ownership of the crude oil or natural gas that we service for our customers. Due to this and the fee-based, long-term nature of our contracts, we believe these agreements will provide us with stable and predictable cash flows. 
Our management team is focused on maintaining its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, we had $130.1 million of liquidity available, including $5.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $125.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under a $575.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). We have the flexibility to expand the aggregate commitment amount under our Revolving Credit Facility from $575.0 million to $775.0 million, subject to certain conditions. 
Leverage our relationship with Oasis Petroleum. We intend to leverage our relationship with Oasis Petroleum to expand our asset base and increase our cash flows through:
•Organic growth. Our midstream infrastructure footprint services Oasis Petroleum’s acreage positions in the Williston and Permian Basins. We anticipate we will be positioned to increase our throughput volumes and cash flows as Oasis Petroleum develops its acreage positions and uses our crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream assets to service its production volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our pipelines gathered approximately 98% and disposed of approximately 91% of the produced and flowback water volumes produced from Oasis Petroleum’s operated wells. We will seek to increase this percentage as we increase utilization on our existing pipelines and further develop our midstream infrastructure with volumes from Oasis Petroleum and third parties.
•Dropdown acquisitions from Oasis Petroleum. As of December 31, 2020, Oasis Petroleum owns a 64.7% economic interest in Bobcat DevCo and a 30% economic interest in Beartooth DevCo, both of which are subject to our ROFO or ROFR, as applicable, with Oasis Petroleum or its successors. We anticipate that we will have the opportunity to make accretive acquisitions from Oasis Petroleum by acquiring the remaining equity interests in Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo. We also anticipate acquiring assets that are not currently included in the DevCos that we anticipate Oasis Petroleum will develop to support its production activities. 
Attract third-party customers. We have successfully entered into agreements with third party customers for crude oil services, natural gas services and water services. We expect to continue to attract incremental volumes from other upstream oil and gas operators to expand our systems and increase the utilization of our existing midstream assets. The scale of our assets and their strategic location near concentrated areas of current and expected future production make our geographic footprint difficult for competitors to replicate, thereby providing us the ability to gather incremental throughput volumes at a lower cost than new market entrants or competitors with less scale or undersized assets. We believe that our strategically located assets and our experience in designing, permitting, constructing and operating cost-efficient crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream assets will allow us to continue to grow our third-party business.
Complete accretive acquisitions from third parties. In addition to growing our business organically and through dropdown acquisitions from Oasis Petroleum, we intend to make accretive acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties. Leveraging our knowledge of, and expertise in, the Williston and Permian Basins, we intend to target and efficiently execute economically attractive acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties within and beyond our current areas of operation. We also intend to explore accretive acquisition opportunities from third parties in support of any geographic expansion of Oasis Petroleum’s operations.
Environmental, social and governance leadership. We are committed to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives and continue to implement new ESG best practices. We work to provide safe, reliable transportation of our natural resources in a responsible manner. We are focused on identifying opportunities to minimize our environmental impact, improve safety and support the communities in which we live and work. We are a recognized industry leader in the capture of natural gas to support a reduction of emissions industry-wide. For the year ended December 31, 2020, gas capture from Oasis Petroleum volumes in Wild Basin was approximately 98%.
Our competitive strengths
We believe that we will be able to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths:
Strategically located midstream assets. Our midstream assets are strategically located in the Williston and Permian Basins and provide critical midstream infrastructure to our customers in a cost-efficient manner. We believe that the strategic location of our assets within the highly economic core of these basins, combined with our cost-advantaged midstream service offering, will enable us to continue to attract volumes from producers.
•Demand for midstream infrastructure services. Our acreage dedications from Oasis Petroleum in both the Williston and Permian Basins are located in the primary areas of focus for Oasis Petroleum’s drilling plans. We believe the extensive midstream infrastructure we have built and are continuing to build provides a strategic footprint in the core of these basins and provides opportunities to continue to connect other third-party operators. We believe our midstream assets will continue to be able to compete for third-party business based on the cost-effective nature of our midstream services compared to the current alternatives. Additionally, due to the core location of our assets, we believe that development will occur in and around our assets in the current commodity price environment and future development activity will be highly levered to a commodity price recovery.
•Strategically located infrastructure. We believe our strategically located infrastructure provides highly strategic takeaway alternatives for operators in the core of the Williston and Permian Basins. In the Williston Basin, our existing infrastructure footprint is strategically located near areas of current and expected future production to enable us to grow volumes in a capital efficient manner. In the Permian Basin, our crude oil gathering and produced and flowback water gathering and disposal systems are located in the oiliest, most economic area of the basin, and our infrastructure provides connectivity to key market hubs with connections to long haul crude oil pipelines that provide downstream access to premium coastal markets.
•Full-service operational flexibility. In addition to our crude oil, natural gas and water gathering capabilities, our midstream assets in the Williston Basin also include crude oil blending, stabilization and storage, and a mainline FERC-regulated crude oil pipeline to the sales destination, Johnson’s Corner. We have two fully operational natural gas processing plants with approximately 280 MMscfpd of processing capacity that services production from Oasis Petroleum and third parties. As production increases in the Williston Basin, our interconnected system is constructed to provide optionality, which increases our growth prospects and value proposition to additional third-party customers.
Stable and predictable cash flows. We provide the substantial majority of our midstream services to Oasis Petroleum on a fixed-fee basis under long-term contracts. Our assets are newly constructed, leading to relatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, which also enhances the stability of our cash flows. We believe that the operating history of Oasis Petroleum and other producers in the areas we operate has reduced development risk and increased the predictability of future production of new wells. This operating history, combined with the structure of our commercial contracts, is expected to promote the generation of stable and predictable cash flows. 
Our strategic affiliation with Oasis Petroleum. We believe that, as a result of owning a 92% controlling interest in OMP GP LLC (our “General Partner”), its ownership of 67.5% of our outstanding units and its retained interests in two of our DevCos, Oasis Petroleum is incentivized to promote and support our growth plan and to pursue projects that enhance the overall value of our business. We believe our assets are highly efficient, with demonstrated high rates of availability and operational reliability designed to withstand harsh conditions, and can be operated at what we consider to be relatively low costs. Additionally, our assets are strategically located within Oasis Petroleum’s acreage positions and are in close proximity to other operators, positioning us as a leading provider of midstream services in the Williston and Permian Basins.
•The development of the Williston and Permian Basins is a strategic priority for Oasis Petroleum. Oasis Petroleum owns and operates a quality asset base with a large inventory of leasehold acreage in the core areas of the Williston and Permian Basins. We believe we will directly benefit from Oasis Petroleum’s continued development of its acreage, where it serves as operator with respect to substantially all of its net wells. 
•Dropdown acquisition opportunities. As of December 31, 2020, Oasis Petroleum retains a 64.7% economic interest in Bobcat DevCo and a 30% economic interest in Beartooth DevCo, both of which are subject to our ROFO or ROFR, as applicable, with Oasis Petroleum or its successors. In addition, we believe Oasis Petroleum will continue to build crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream assets to support its production growth. We anticipate that we will have the opportunity to make accretive acquisitions from Oasis Petroleum by acquiring the remaining equity interests in Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo.
Financial flexibility and strong capital structure. We have a balanced capital structure which, when combined with our stable and predictable cash flows, should allow us to access capital markets when they are constructive. We believe that our ownership 
structure, available borrowing capacity and potential ability to access the equity and debt capital markets will provide us with the financial flexibility to successfully execute our organic growth and acquisition strategies. We will seek to maintain a disciplined approach of executing and financing acquisitions and growth projects with an appropriate mix of equity and debt based on market conditions.
Experienced management and operating teams with strong execution track record. Through our relationship with Oasis Petroleum, we will benefit from a significant pool of management talent, strong relationships throughout the energy industry and broad operational, technical, business development and administrative infrastructure. These professionals have significant experience building, permitting and operating assets, including crude oil and natural gas gathering, natural gas processing, produced and flowback water gathering and disposal and freshwater distribution. We believe access to these personnel will, among other things, enhance the efficiency of our operations and accelerate our growth.
Our relationship with Oasis Petroleum
Our relationship with Oasis Petroleum is one of our principal strengths. As of December 31, 2020, Oasis Petroleum owns an aggregate 67.5% limited partner interest in us and a 92% controlling interest in our General Partner, which owns all of our incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”) and our non-economic general partner interest. As of December 31, 2020, Oasis Petroleum also indirectly owns 64.7% of Bobcat DevCo and 30% of Beartooth DevCo. Oasis Petroleum intends to use us as an integral vehicle to support its production in the Williston and Permian Basins and the primary vehicle to grow the midstream infrastructure business that supports its production activities. Additionally, our assets are strategically located within Oasis Petroleum’s acreage positions, and we believe we will directly benefit from Oasis Petroleum’s continued development of its acreage, where it serves as operator with respect to substantially all of its net wells.
We intend to expand our business through the acquisition of Oasis Petroleum’s retained interests in Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo, the acquisition of midstream assets that Oasis Petroleum constructs, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Oasis Midstream Services LLC (“OMS”), selective acquisitions of complementary assets from third parties and by organic growth from the increased usage of our services by Oasis Petroleum and third parties. 
Oasis Petroleum is the only customer that accounts for more than 10% of our revenues and the loss of Oasis Petroleum as a customer would have a material adverse effect on us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Contractual arrangements with Oasis Petroleum
As of December 31, 2020, we are party to the following commercial agreements with certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Oasis Petroleum:
Omnibus Agreement; Subject Assets
The Partnership entered into an omnibus agreement (the “Omnibus Agreement”) with Oasis Petroleum and certain of its affiliates, pursuant to which:

Bighorn DevCo entered into an amendment and assignment agreement with OPM and OMS (the “Amendment and Assignment Agreement”) pursuant to which Bighorn DevCo became a party to the long-term, fixed-fee agreement previously entered into by OPM and OMS providing for crude transportation services from the Wild Basin area to Johnson’s Corner through a FERC-regulated pipeline system that has up to 75,000 barrels per day of operating capacity and firm capacity for committed shippers. The Amendment and Assignment Agreement is renewable at OPM’s option (subject to certain limitations) and includes minimum volume commitments that are not material to the Partnership’s operating results.
South Nesson Project Dedication 
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, Oasis Petroleum approved an expansion of its acreage dedication to the Partnership in the South Nesson project area of the Williston Basin to include crude oil and produced water services. The Partnership received the acreage dedication from Oasis Petroleum for natural gas services in 2019. As part of the arrangement, Oasis Petroleum agreed to assign to Bighorn DevCo certain assets currently owned by Bobcat DevCo that were specifically built to support third party customers in South Nesson, as well as future development of Oasis Petroleum. Bighorn DevCo will reimburse Oasis Petroleum for its investment in certain assets previously constructed by Bobcat DevCo.
Delivery Commitments
As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership had certain agreements with an aggregate requirement to either deliver or purchase a minimum quantity of approximately 7.6 million barrels of water and approximately 18.9 million barrels of crude oil, prior to any applicable volume credits, within specified timeframes, all of which are ten years or less. We are required to make periodic deficiency payments for any shortfalls in delivering the minimum volume commitments under certain agreements. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies” for a description of our material volume commitments.
Competition
As a result of our long-term, fixed fee commercial agreements with Oasis Petroleum, we do not compete for the portion of Oasis Petroleum’s existing operations for which we currently provide midstream services. For areas where acreage is not dedicated to us, the DevCos will compete with similar enterprises in providing additional midstream infrastructure services in those areas of operation. Some of these competitors may expand or construct midstream infrastructure systems that would create additional competition for the services provided by the DevCos to crude oil and natural gas producers. In addition, third parties that are significant producers of crude oil and natural gas in the DevCos’ areas of operation may develop their own midstream infrastructure systems in lieu of employing the DevCos’ services.
Title to Our Properties
Substantially all of our interests in the real property on which our assets are located derive from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations, and we believe that we have satisfactory interests in and to these lands. We have leased or acquired easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses in these lands without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets will be located, and we believe that we have satisfactory interests in such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.
Seasonality
Demand for crude oil and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain crude oil and natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. In respect of our completed 
midstream systems, we do not expect seasonal conditions to have a material impact on our throughput volumes. Severe or prolonged winters may, however, impact our ability to complete additional well connections or construction projects, which may impact the rate of our growth. In addition, severe weather may also impact or slow the ability of Oasis Petroleum to execute its drilling and development plan and increase operating expenses associated with repairs or anti-freezing operations.
Insurance
We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses, and losses not covered by insurance would increase our costs. Also, insurance rates are subject to fluctuation, so future insurance coverage could increase our costs. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are economically acceptable, which could result in less coverage, increases in costs or higher deductibles and retentions.
Water and natural resource-related solid waste disposal involves several hazards and operational risks, including environmental damage from leaks, spills or vehicle accidents. To address the hazards inherent to our produced and flowback water gathering and disposal business, our insurance coverage includes commercial general liability, employer’s liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental liability and other coverage. Coverage for pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations and could be excluded on such policies. 
Pipeline Safety Regulation
Certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act (“HLPSA”) with respect to crude oil and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (“NGPSA”) with respect to natural gas. The HLPSA and NGPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of crude oil and natural gas pipeline facilities. These laws have resulted in the adoption of rules by PHMSA, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain relatively higher risk areas, known as high consequence areas (“HCAs”) and moderate consequence areas (“MCAs”) along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. The HCAs for natural gas pipelines are predicated on high-population areas (which, for natural gas transmission pipelines, may include Class 3 and Class 4 areas), whereas HCAs for crude oil pipelines are based on high-population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. An MCA is attributable to natural gas pipelines and is based on high-population areas as well as certain principal, high-capacity roadways, but an MCA does not meet the relatively higher population totals of an HCA and therefore are located outside of HCA coverages. In addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New pipeline safety laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. 
Legislation in the past decade has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. In particular, the HLPSA and NGPSA were amended by the Pipeline, Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the “2011 Pipeline Safety Act”) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (“2016 Pipeline Safety Act”). The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, required PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practice constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid or gas pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. More recently, Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2021 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, made effective on December 27, 2020, pursuant to which Congress adopted the “Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020.” The PIPES Act of 2020 reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several regulatory actions that, among other things, will require operators of non-rural gas gathering lines and new and existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to conduct certain leak detection and repair programs and to require facility inspection and maintenance plans to align with those regulations.
New regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. In October 2019, PHMSA published a final rule, made effective in July 2020, that significantly extends and 
expands the reach of certain PHMSA hazardous liquid pipeline integrity management requirements, such as, for example, performance of periodic assessments and expanded use of leak detection systems, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to an HCA (for example, integrity assessments at least once every 10 years for onshore, piggable, hazardous liquid pipeline segments located outside of HCAs, and expanded use of leak detection systems outside of HCAs on all regulated hazardous liquid pipelines other than offshore gathering and regulated rural gathering pipelines). Additionally, this final rule requires all hazardous liquid pipelines in or affecting an HCA to be capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools within the next 20 years unless the basic construction of a pipeline cannot be modified to permit that accommodation. Moreover, this final rule extends annual accident and safety-related conditional reporting requirements to hazardous liquid gravity lines and certain gathering lines and also imposes inspection requirements on hazardous liquid pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure. 
In October 2019, PHMSA also published the first of three expected final rules relating to new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas pipelines, that had originally been proposed in 2016 as part of PHMSA’s “gas Mega Rule,” which first final rule became effective on July 1, 2020. This natural gas pipeline final rule imposed numerous requirements, including maximum allowable operating pressure (“MAOP”) reconfirmation through re-verification of all historical records for pipelines in service, which re-certification process may require natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 (previously excluded from certain pressure testing obligations) to be pressure tested, the periodic assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs (including all MCAs and those Class 3 and Class 4 areas not found in HCAs) within 14 years of the publication date and at least once every 10 years thereafter, the reporting of exceedances of MAOP, and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. We are currently evaluating the operational and financial impact related to this final rule. The remaining rulemakings comprising the Gas Mega Rule have not yet been published, and we cannot predict when they will be finalized; however, they are expected to include revised pipeline repair criteria as well as more stringent corrosion control requirements. New legislation or any new regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting development or expansion of projects. In the absence of the PHMSA pursuing any legal requirements, state agencies, to the extent authorized, may pursue state standards, including standards for rural gathering lines.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
Our crude oil gathering and transportation, natural gas gathering and processing, and produced and flowback water gathering and disposal services and related operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, the handling, discharge or disposal of materials and wastes, and the protection of natural resources and the environment. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) customers’ operations, including, among other things, the acquisition of permits for regulated activities; the incurrence of capital or operating expenditures to limit or prevent releases of materials from operations; a limitation on the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with operations; a restriction on the way wastes are handled or disposed; a limitation or prohibition on activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; the imposition of investigatory and remedial actions to prevent or mitigate pollution conditions caused by operations or attributable to former operations; the imposition of specific safety and health standards addressing worker protections; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. Numerous governmental agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and analogous state agencies, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays, or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, loss of leases and the issuance of injunctions limiting some or all of our operations in a particular area.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any new laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly midstream management activities, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers and some or all of those costs may not be recoverable from insurance. 
Additionally, accidental spills or other releases may occur in the course of our operations and we cannot be sure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for costs required to 
remediate and restore sites where hydrocarbons, materials or wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years.
Moreover, our E&P customers are also subject to these same laws and regulations. Our customers’ liability under, or costs and expenditures to comply with, environmental laws and regulations could lead to delays and increased operating costs, which could reduce the volumes of crude oil and natural gas that move through our gathering systems or processing plants. Moreover, changes in environmental laws could limit our customers’ businesses or encourage our customers to handle and dispose of wastes in other ways, which, in either case, could reduce the demand for our gathering, transportation, processing and disposal services and adversely impact our business. While compliance with some environmental laws and regulations creates a need for assets such as our own, other environmental laws and regulations could reduce the demand for our services. For instance, some states have considered laws mandating the recycling of produced and flowback water generated by crude oil and natural gas development and production activities. If such laws are passed, our customers may divert some produced and flowback water to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities.
We may also experience a delay in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may cause us to lose potential and current E&P customers, interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenues, which in turn could affect our profitability. In addition, our customers’ liability under, or compliance with, environmental laws and regulations could lead to increased operating costs and restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, which could reduce the volumes of crude oil and natural gas that move through our gathering systems or processing plants.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations and the operations of our customers are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or financial position.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, non-hazardous wastes, hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund law,” and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have caused or contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we handle materials that may be regulated as hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes. 
We also generate and accept for disposal from our E&P customers wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. RCRA regulates the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of both non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, but it imposes more stringent requirements on the management of hazardous wastes. In the course of our or our customers’ operations, some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes are generated that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Most E&P waste, if properly handled, is currently exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste under RCRA. However, it is possible that certain E&P waste now classified as non-hazardous waste and exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes. Repeal or modification of the current RCRA E&P waste exemption or similar exemptions under state law could cause us and our customers to become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
We currently own, lease, or operate upon a number of properties that have been used for crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production support-service activities for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons 
may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial closure operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be material.
In the course of our operations, some of our storage and process vessels, piping work areas and other equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive material (“NORM”) associated with crude oil and natural gas production. NORM-contaminated scale deposits and other accumulations exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage and process vessels, piping and work areas affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. As a result of our operations we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.
Subsurface Injections
Our produced and flowback water underground injection operations are subject to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require us to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. States may add more stringent restrictions on the operation of injection wells when a permit is renewed or amended, which may require material expenditures at our facilities or impose significant restraints or financial assurances on our operations. Although we monitor the injection process of our wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Also, some states have considered laws mandating the recycling of produced and flowback water. If such laws are passed, our E&P customers may divert some produced and flowback water to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities, which reduces the demand for our services. In addition, our sales of residual crude oil collected as part of the produced and flowback water injection process may impose liability on us in the event that the entity to which the crude oil was transferred fails to manage and dispose of residual crude oil in accordance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws.
There exists a growing concern amongst the public and federal and state agencies that the injection of produced and flowback water into below ground disposal wells may trigger seismic activity. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas as being among six states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or crude oil and natural gas extraction. Since that time, the United States Geological Survey indicates that these rates have decreased in these states, although concern continues to exist over quakes arising from induced seismic activities. In response to these concerns, federal and some state agencies have investigated and continue to investigate, whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. Also, regulators in some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, additional requirements related to seismic safety, including the permitting of disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells, which has resulted in some states restricting, suspending or shutting down the use of such injection wells. For example, in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission has adopted rules governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced and flowback water and other fluids resulting from the production of crude oil and natural gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Also, North Dakota requires a map depicting the area around the location where the disposal well is proposed that depicts any known or suspected faults. 
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (“Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as waters of the United States and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct activities in waters and wetlands. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States, and individual permits or coverage under general permits must also be obtained to authorize discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of industrial facilities. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon storage tank spill, rupture or leak.
The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
(“Corps”). The EPA and the Corps under the Obama Administration published a final rule in 2015 that would significantly expand the scope of the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands. However, the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration issued a final rule, made effective in December 2019, that repealed the 2015 rule and they also published a final rule in April 2020 re-defining the term “waters of the United States” as applied under the Clean Water Act and narrowing the scope of waters subject to federal regulation. The April 2020 final rule is subject to various pending legal challenges; moreover, there is an expectation that the Biden Administration may reconsider this April 2020 final rule. If the EPA and the Corps under the Biden Administration revise the April 2020 final rule in a manner similar to or more stringent than the original 2015 final rule, or if any challenge to the April 2020 final rule is successful, the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our E&P customers conduct operations could again be expanded and result in increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Any such developments could delay, restrict or halt permitting or development of projects, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our and our E&P customers’ operations.
The primary federal law related specifically to crude oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which establishes strict, joint and several liability for certain responsible parties in connection to releases of crude oil into waters of the United States. The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on owners and operators of certain crude oil and natural gas facilities that handle certain quantities of crude oil, including the preparation of crude oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an crude oil spill. If a release of crude oil into the waters of the United States occurred, we could be liable for clean-up costs and various damages under the OPA.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us or our E&P customers to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain crude oil and natural gas-related projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to restrict, delay or cancel the expansion of our projects as well as our customers’ development of crude oil and natural gas projects. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
In recent years, there has been increased regulation with respect to air emissions resulting from the crude oil and natural gas sector. For example, in 2015, the EPA under the Obama Administration issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards. Since that time, the EPA under the Trump Administration has issued attainment/nonattainment designations and on December 31, 2020, published notice of a final action that, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standard in accord with CAA requirements, elected to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, this December 2020 final action is subject to legal challenge, and the NAAQS may be subject to further revision under the Biden Administration. State implementation of these revised standards for ground-level ozone could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Climate Change
The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable public, political and scientific attention in the United States and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous regulatory initiatives have been made, and are likely to continue to be made, at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our E&P customers are subject to a series of executive, regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.
In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, but President Biden has announced plans to take action with regards to climate change, has already signed several executive orders to this effect in January 2021 and, with control of Congress shifting in January 2021, is expected to pursue legislative as well as other executive and regulatory initiatives in the future to limit GHG emissions. Moreover, because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, implement New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the crude oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of the emissions of methane, which may be released during hydraulic fracturing, as the EPA under the Obama Administration published final regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards in 2016, but since that time the EPA under the Trump 
Administration had undertaken several measures to delay implementation of the methane standards, including publishing in September 2020 final rule policy and technical amendments to the NSPS, for stationary sources of air emissions. The policy amendments, effective September 14, 2020, notably removed the transmission and storage sector from the regulated source category and rescinded methane and VOC requirements for the remaining sources that were established by the Obama Administration, whereas the technical amendments, effective November 16, 2020, included changes to fugitive emissions monitoring and repair schedules for gathering and boosting compressor stations and low-production wells, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and more. Various industry and environmental groups are separately challenging both the 2016 standards and the EPA’s September 2020 final rules and on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order, that among other things, directed the EPA to reconsider the technical amendments and issue a proposed rule suspending, revising or rescinding those amendments by no later than September 2021. A reconsideration of the September 2020 policy amendments is expected to follow. The January 20, 2021 executive order also directed the establishment of new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing crude oil and natural gas operations, including the production, transmission, processing and storage segments. 
Separately, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the non-binding “Paris Agreement” requests that nations limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. While the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, President Biden has issued executive orders in January 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement and calling for the federal government to begin formulating the United States’ nationally determined emissions reduction goal under the agreement. With the United States recommitting to the Paris Agreement, executive orders may be issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives may be adopted to achieve the agreement’s goals, which could require us or our customers to incur increased, potentially significant, costs to comply with such requirements. 
Governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States. Beyond the Biden Administration’s recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement and proposing to re-instate the Obama methane standards, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order, effective immediately, that suspends new crude oil and natural gas leases and drilling permits on non-Indian federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days. Building on this suspension, President Biden issued an executive order on January 27, 2021 that suspends new leasing activities for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production on non-Indian federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal crude oil and natural gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with crude oil and natural gas activities on such lands and waters. The January 20, 2021 and January 27, 2021 orders do not apply to existing leases and the January 27, 2021 order further directs applicable agencies to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. Legal challenges to these suspensions are expected, with at least one industry group filing a lawsuit on January 27, 2021 in Wyoming federal district court and seeking to have the moratorium on leasing declared invalid. If our customers, including Oasis Petroleum, are unable to secure drilling permits, sustained reductions in exploration or production activities in our areas of operation could lead to reduced utilization of our systems. Approximately 3% of Oasis Petroleum’s net acreage position in the Williston Basin is federal mineral acreage, which is spread across its acreage position, and any portion of a well on federal land requires a permit.
Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as well as other companies handling fossil fuels, including owners of terminals, pipelines and refineries, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. 
Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events. If any such climate changes were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our customers.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, including crude oil and natural gas, from low permeability formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into targeted formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Our E&P customers regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of their operations. 
Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies but federal agencies have conducted investigations or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. Moreover, in 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) under the Obama Administration published a final rule imposing more stringent standards on hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water. However, in late 2018, the BLM under the Trump Administration published a final rule rescinding the 2016 final rule. Litigation challenging the BLM's 2016 final rule as well as its 2018 final rule rescinding the 2016 rule has been pursued by various states and industry and environmental groups. While a California federal court vacated the 2018 final rule in July 2020, a Wyoming federal court subsequently vacated the 2016 final rule in October 2020 and, accordingly, the 2016 final rule is no longer in effect but the Wyoming decision is expected to be appealed. Additionally, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities to the extent involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities; has issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act; and published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional crude oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. 
From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. However, with President Biden taking office and the shift in party control of the Congressional Senate in January 2021, there is a possibility that a Biden Administration will pursue such legislation. In addition to pursuing the revision of existing laws and regulations, President Biden has issued, and may continue to issue, additional executive orders in pursuit of his regulatory agenda with regards to limiting hydraulic fracturing.
In addition, a number of states, including North Dakota, Montana and Texas, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations imposing new permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could impose moratoriums or elect to place certain prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing. Also, local governments could seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.
If new federal, state or local restrictions or bans on hydraulic fracturing are adopted in areas where our E&P customers operate, our E&P customers’ fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements, reporting requirements, operational restrictions, permitting delays, restrictions or cancellations in their production activities or additional costs. Any such laws or regulations could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable and reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that our customers are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities, and thus significantly affect our business. Such laws and regulations could also materially increase our cost of business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed, which could have an indirect adverse impact on the demand for our produced and flowback water gathering and disposal services.
National Environmental Policy Act
Crude oil and natural gas E&P activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. 
On July 16, 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) under the Trump Administration published a final rule modifying the NEPA. The modified final rule establishes a time limit of two years for preparation of environmental impact statements and one year for the preparation of environmental assessments. The modified rule also eliminates the responsibility to consider cumulative effects of a project. We expect that the final rule will be delayed or not implemented as the final rule is being challenged in court and we anticipate that President Biden will have the CEQ under his administration reconsider or withdraw the rule.
Depending on any mitigation strategies recommended in such environmental assessments or environmental impact statements, we and our E&P customers could incur added costs, which could be substantial, and our customers could be subject to delays, limitations or prohibitions in the scope of crude oil and natural gas projects, which could reduce demand for our midstream services. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt our activities or our customers’ E&P activities. President Biden has pledged to ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters, and the Biden Administration has recently issued orders temporary suspending such new leases and drilling permits on federal properties.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and comparable state laws restrict crude oil and natural gas-related activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Birds Treaty Act (“MBTA”). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) under former President Trump issued a final rule on January 7, 2021, which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the MBTA will apply only to actions “directed at” migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs. We expect that the Biden Administration will reconsider this rulemaking. To the extent species that are listed under the ESA or similar state laws live in the areas where our operations and our E&P customers’ operations are conducted, our and our customers’ abilities to conduct or expand operations and construct facilities could be limited or could force us or our customers to incur significant additional costs. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for crude oil and natural gas development. In addition, the FWS may make new determinations on the listing of species as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The dunes sagebrush lizard is one example of a species that, if listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA in the future, could impact our E&P customers’ operations. The designation of previously undesignated species as endangered or threatened could cause us to incur additional costs or cause our customers’ operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans or limit future development activity in affected areas, which developments could reduce demand for our gathering, transportation, processing and disposal services.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. In addition, OSHA’s implementation of the hazard communications standard, the EPA’s implementation of community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, and comparable state statutes require that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. These laws and regulations are subject to change, as are the enforcement priorities of OSHA and the analogous state agencies. Failure to comply with these laws could lead to the assertion of third-party claims against us, civil or criminal fines and changes in the way we operate our facilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
The oil and gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry could affect the demand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Historically, our compliance costs with applicable laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flow and results of operations; however, new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement may occur and, thus, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. Additionally, environmental incidents such as spills or other releases may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may be finalized and become effective.
Regulation of Transportation of Crude Oil
Only the crude oil transportation system connecting the Wild Basin area to the Johnson’s Corner market center transports crude oil in interstate commerce. FERC regulates interstate crude oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 as modified by the Elkins Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules promulgated under those laws. In general, interstate crude oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for crude oil pipelines that allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index, without making a cost of service filing. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC crude oil index to change transportation rates annually every July 1, and our Bighorn DevCo Johnson’s Corner line will utilize the FERC crude oil index beginning on July 1, 2022. Every five years, FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. Most recently, on December 17, 2020, FERC established a new price index for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, in which common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by Producer Price Index plus 0.78%. FERC has received requests for rehearing of its December 17, 2020 order, which remain pending in FERC Docket No. RM20-14-000.
Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or proposed new or changed rates, services, or terms and conditions of service. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit a regulated pipeline’s ability to charge rates until completion of an investigation during which FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful. In contrast, FERC has clarified that initial rates and terms of service agreed upon with committed shippers in a transportation services agreement are not subject to protest or a cost-of-service analysis where the pipeline held an open season offering all potential shippers service on the same terms.
A successful rate challenge could result in a regulated pipeline paying refunds of revenue collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate, together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect, if any. FERC may also order a pipeline to reduce its rates prospectively, and may require a regulated pipeline to pay shippers reparations retroactively for rate overages for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. We may also be required to respond to requests for information from government agencies, including compliance audits conducted by FERC. Finally, under the ICA, FERC may impose civil penalties of up to $1,368 per violation for failure or refusal to comply with regulations or orders concerning posting and filing rate schedules issued by the Commission, and $69 per day thereafter; up to $1,368 per violation per day for failure to comply with certain requirements to provide information or keep certain accounts or records; and up to $13,685 per violation per day for knowing or neglectful failure to comply with the Commission’s orders under certain provisions of the ICA. All of the civil penalty amounts listed in the previous sentence are adjusted each year for inflation.
Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas
Historically, the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. Gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case by case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that our customers produce.
Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting our Industry 
Energy Policy Act of 2005. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). EPAct 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. EPAct 2005 provides FERC 
with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,307,164 per day for violations of the NGA, adjusted annually for inflation, and increases FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,307,164 per violation per day, adjusted annually for inflation. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-manipulation provision of EPAct 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rule makes it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but do apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704, as described below. The anti-manipulation rules and enhanced civil penalty authority increased FERC’s NGA enforcement authority. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
State Regulation
States regulate the drilling of crude oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of crude oil and natural gas resources. For example, beginning in 2014, the North Dakota Department Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) issued orders and pursued other regulatory initiatives to implement legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” targeting the capture of natural gas produced in the state. Pursuant to those legal requirements, there currently exists an enforceable gas capture percentage goal of 91% that went into effect on November 1, 2020. In enforcing these requirements, the NDIC requires operators to develop and implement Gas Capture Plans to maintain consistency with the agency’s gas capture percentage goals but it maintains flexibility in excluding certain gas volumes from consideration in calculating compliance with the state’s gas capture percentage goals. Wells must continue to meet or exceed the NDIC’s gas capture percentage goals on a statewide, county, per-field, or per-well basis. Failure of an operator to comply with the applicable goal at maximum efficiency rate may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and restrictions on production from subject wells. Most recently, in September 2020, the NDIC revised the gas capture policy to allow several added exceptions for companies that flare natural gas under certain circumstances, such as gas plant outages or delays in securing a right-of-way for pipeline construction, but the policy did not change the gas capture targets. However, to the extent that our E&P customers attempt to, but cannot comply with these gas capture requirements, those customers could incur increased compliance costs or restrictions on future production, which development could reduce demand for our services and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure our unitholders that they will not do so in the future. The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
