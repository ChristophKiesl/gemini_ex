Item 1. Business.
 
SEEDO CORP. (f/k/a GRCR Partners Inc.) (the “Company”, “Our” or “We”) was formed on January 16, 2015 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to September 14th, 2018, we were solely a provider of risk management and asset protection (“RAP”) services for businesses, individuals and families. On September 14th, 2018, (“the Company”) executed an Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement with Eroll Grow Tech Ltd. (“Eroll”), an Israeli Corporation that was formed on May 18th, 2015 under the laws of the state of Israel. On September 17, 2018, the Board of Directors adopted an Amendment to its Articles, changing the name of the Corporation to SEEDO CORP. The State of Delaware effectuated said change on September 21, 2018; and on November 5, 2018, FINRA granted effectiveness for said change and the new ticker Symbol ”SEDO”. Post-Acquisition, SEEDO CORP changed its main business focus to Eroll’s business activities while continuing with some RAP activities.
 
Eroll was focused on producing automated plant growing devices managed and controlled by an artificial intelligent algorithm, allowing consumers to grow their own herbs and vegetables from seed to plant, while providing optimal conditions to assure premium quality produce year-round.
 
During the third quarter of 2019, Eroll was experiencing financial and operational difficulties and on December 10, 2019, Mr. Zohar Levy, the Company’s CEO at the time, on behalf of Eroll filed a petition (the “Petition”) for a debt settlement in the Nazareth District Court (the “Court”), in accordance with Section 321 of Chapter A of Part G of the Israeli Insolvency and Economic Rehabilitation Law, seeking a debt settlement and a suspension of proceedings in order to protect Eroll’s creditors from economic damages and other future damages and to allow the Eroll to maintain its business while seeking a proposal of an acquisition of the Eroll and/or its activities and assets.
 
In the petition, Eroll requested that the Court authorize its entering into a loan agreement with a potential buyer, as a temporary solution until a definitive agreement is signed, and to issue an order calling for a creditors’ meeting within 10 days and appointment of a trustee, who will negotiate a definitive agreement with the potential buyer.
 
The Company is not included in such proceedings and is not otherwise involved in any bankruptcy proceedings.
 
On December 11, 2019, Eroll received an offer to acquire Eroll and/or its assets and business from a potential buyer (the “Potential Buyer” and the “Acquisition Offer” respectively). As part of the Acquisition Offer, the Potential Buyer agreed to provide a bridge loan in the amount of $400,000 (the “Bridge Loan”) to be repaid within 20 days, which the Eroll will use for payroll, payment of debt to a certain Chinese manufacturer, and certain other enumerated urgent payments necessary to keep Eroll’s assets active.
 
To ensure the repayment of the loan within 20 days, if the Acquisition Offer is not approved and the loan is not repaid on time, the Potential Buyer was to receive the rights to all of the products in inventory and productions at the Chinese manufacture and Eroll’s warehouse. Additionally, the Potential Buyer was to receive an irrevocable power of attorney and authorization of Eroll to act directly with the Chinese manufacture.
 
On December 17, 2019, the Court approved Eroll’s entering into the Acquisition Offer, on condition that the Bridge Loan will be repaid by purchasing all of Eroll’s inventory in China, the United States, Canada and the Netherlands, and subject to the Court’s approval of any transfer of Eroll’s inventory. Additionally, the Court issued an order of suspension and stay of all legal proceedings against Eroll.
 
On December 19, 2019, the Court appointed a debt settlement manager, who will have the authority to determine if an alternative settlement is appropriate.
 
Due to the fact that Eroll was not able to secure the Bridge Loan under the conditions determined by the Court, on January 2, 2020, the Settlement Manager filed a request to the Court for entering into an interim funding agreement with the Potential Buyer (the “Interim Funding Agreement”). As part of the Interim Funding Agreement, the Potential Buyer agreed to provide a loan in the amount of $294,000 (the “Loan”), which the Eroll was to use for payroll, and certain other enumerated urgent payments necessary to keep Eroll’s assets active, until a creditors meeting is convened in order to approve a debt settlement based on a final acquisition offer from the Potential Buyer. To ensure the repayment of the Loan, the Potential Buyer was to receive a lien over certain intellectual property of Eroll, future payments to Eroll from PayPal and Eroll’s property.

On January 5, 2020, the Court approved the Settlement Managers’ request to enter into the Interim Funding Agreement.
 
Additionally, on January 8, 2020, the Court issued an order of stay of all legal proceedings against Eroll, and an order prohibiting any disposition of the Eroll’s property. Any transfer of any of Eroll’s property and rights, including patents, shall be done subject to the Courts approval. In addition, the Court ordered that Eroll will continue its activities temporarily, and appointed the Settlement Manager as Eroll’s trustee, who will, among others, convene a creditor’s meeting to approve a debt settlement based on a final acquisition offer from the Potential Buyer, to be convened no later than January 19, 2020.
 
On March 25, 2020, the Nazareth District Court of the State of Israel (the “Court”) approved the purchase of all of Eroll Grow Tech Ltd.’s (“Eroll”) assets by a non-related third-party entity named Seedo Agriculture Ltd. Therefore, from the closing of such purchase, the Company no longer has any legal ties nor privity with Eroll. The Company is focusing on its in-house research and development of agriculture technology products, among others, in the fields of exotic plants and mushrooms.
 
On July 19, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Hachevra Legiduley Pkaot Beisrael Ltd. (the “New Subsidiary”), to develop a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing saffron and other vegetables. On November 5, 2020, the New Subsidiary changed its name to Saffron-Tech Ltd. (or “Saffron”).
 
The Company, through Saffron, plans to roll out its proof of concept in the coming months. This technology will provide turnkey automated growing containers for high-quality, high-yield saffron all year round. The Company is in advanced stages of developing and testing a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing high-quality, high-yield saffron anywhere and anytime.
 
The Company’s technology offers a controlled environment based on the Company’s deep knowledge in plant biology. The technology provides optimal conditions for each stage of the plant’s development to reach optimal product quality.
 
The Company’s proof of concept utilizes the “Grow Next to Consumer” policy and is therefore sustainable and fit the COVID-19 restrictions on transport. It is also environmentally friendly, using economic levels of water, space, fertilizer, and energy. Accounting to the Company’s calculations, we believe that the controlled indoor growing area will produce ten times more yield compared to the same land area using traditional methods. The sealed environment eliminates the need for harmful pesticides and herbicides, producing a clean and safe product that is easy to control from anywhere. The Company’s solution is easily scalable and pre-designed to quickly grow operations.
 
Saffron is used in many industries, such as the food industry, particularly by famous chefs and Michelin starred restaurants, the natural cosmetics industry and the natural medicine industry and as a dye in the textile industry. Medicinal claims as an anti-depressant, antioxidant, and antiseptic are constantly increasing.
 
The global saffron market size was valued at $1 Billion in 2019 and is anticipated to attain a revenue based CAGR of 7.3% from 2020 to 2027. The market is expected to grow over the next few years on account of demand from the pharmaceutical sector, particularly in countries with rapid population expansion.
 
Since the incorporation Saffron Tech, Saffron Tech has hired one employee and several consultants to commence the roll out of our proof of concept. Saffron Tech has signed several agreements with Israeli companies, including Growin Ltd (“Growin”) and the Israeli Ministry of Agricultures research organization – The Volcani Center (“Volcani”). Growin is an owner of proprietary systems for indoor agriculture and Saffron Tech has acquired the exclusive right to market, sell and commercialize our product based on the Growin’s hydroponic machines. Volcani will assist Saffron Tech in writing the protocols required to grow saffron in a controlled and automated way, including the use of robotics and AI.
