Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We, a corporation formed in 2002, are an agricultural biotechnology trait company engaged in the development of traits that improve food, feed and fiber crops and enhance the value of the resulting agricultural products. Our customers include seed companies who incorporate these traits into their elite varieties to increase the value of a crop for farmers, as well as food and feed companies who make products that increase the choices and nutritional value of foods for consumers. We are focused on two distinct areas of the agricultural supply chain:

1. | Improvement of crop yield by mitigating the impacts of abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, nutrient deficiency, water scarcity, and soil salinity. These stresses are prevalent in most agricultural environments with varying degrees of severity and often have material consequences on crop production, quality, and farmer incomes. Our traits have been introgressed into several crops, including rice, wheat, and soybeans, and we have demonstrated significant yield improvements in multiple years of field testing. In addition to improving the efficiency of agricultural productions, these traits also have the potential of reducing the impact of agriculture on the environment by lowering water requirements and reducing the occurrence of excess nitrogen runoff from intensive farming.

2. | Enhancement of the nutritional quality of crops by changing the compositional quality of oilseeds and grains. We currently produce and market the SONOVA® brand of oil containing Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid derived from safflower. We recently received GRAS notification (generally recognized as safe) from the FDA for use of SONOVA GLA safflower oil in medical foods and nutritional beverages, which we expect will expand the market for this product. In addition, we are in late stage development of Resistant Starch (RS) wheat, a product with twice as much fiber content as conventional wheat. This and other wheat quality products in our pipeline are being developed using our non-transgenic TILLING technology platform.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our business model is to access trait technologies that have already achieved proof of concept whether in a public research program or with commercial partners. We further develop these technologies by optimizing their function and validating their performance through intensive field trial testing in multiple crops under varying growth conditions, thereby better establishing commercial viability for resulting products. We then license our technologies to major seed and consumer product companies who perform additional testing and product development and, where needed, generate the requisite data to support regulatory submissions and approvals. License agreements with our partners may include financial and non-financial milestones. When products containing our traits are commercialized we will receive a share of the revenue. In select instances, we also work with our commercial partners to make the regulatory filings required to support commercial launch of the traits in order to increase our share of the revenue.
 
We use both genetically modified, or GM, and non-GM technologies to develop our traits. This approach allows us to select the most appropriate technology for development of a particular trait, crop and market. However, a key component of the development cycle of GM traits is that U.S., or in some instances, global deregulation of the trait by one or more regulatory agencies may be required. As there continues to be a significant debate about the role of GM traits in agricultural crops, we have seen this issue begin to impact some regulatory agencies which exercise control over the pace of deregulation of products, thereby allowing commercialization. We have recently experienced delays in the review of many of our high value traits principally due to inaction from these government regulatory authorities. For example, in India, where regulators have not approved field trials for testing of GM traits for the last two years, we estimate the impact to trait development and crop commercialization timelines of our license partner in India, Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company Ltd. (“Mahyco”), could be at least two to three year delay.   
 
As a result of these challenges, and as we continue working closely with our partners to closely monitor the progress of deregulation activities affecting our GM traits, we are realigning our core capabilities and evolving our business model to accelerate the development and commercialization of near-term, non-GM nutrition and quality traits. According to the estimates of the Nutrition Business Journal report, the global nutrition and supplements 
 2

market stood at $96 billion as of 2012. In 2016, it was approximately $140 billion globally. In 2015 alone, investment in agriculture and food technology startups totaled $4.6 billion, while the USDA’s Agriculture and Food Initiative (AFRI) budget for the fiscal year 2017 is estimated to be about $700 million or double the fiscal year 2016 level. 
 
Our highest near-term priorities include the expansion of the market for our SONOVA GLA products, bringing our non-GM traits in wheat quality and wheat yield to market, and working closely with our strategic partners to advance our yield trait in corn and soybeans. In the U.S, we have partnered with Dow AgroSciences and Becks Hybrids for the development of yield traits in corn. In South America, we formed Verdeca, a joint venture with Bioceres, a leading agricultural biotechnology company in Argentina, to develop, deregulate and commercialize stress-tolerant soybeans. Verdeca received its first regulatory approval in Argentina in 2015 and submitted regulatory applications in the U.S to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in China to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in 2016.
 
Our Strengths 
 
We believe we are well positioned among our peers to capitalize on the need to increase crop yields and quality of agricultural products globally through a combination of technological innovation, assets and experience that is unique for a small company engaged in trait development. Our competitive strengths include:

• | World-class research capabilities. Our in-house scientific and product development expertise coupled with our advanced Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes, or TILLING, know-how have resulted in the discovery and development of several traits in our commercialization pipeline. Our TILLING platform enables us to discover and develop value-added traits that are considered non-GM. This platform leverages high-throughput screening of induced genetic diversity in plant populations in major crops. Our TILLING populations currently include wheat, rice, soybean, and canola. These populations include numerous native and induced gene function alterations, which can be exploited rapidly at low cost and with minimal regulatory requirements. While the TILLING approach is also practiced elsewhere, we believe that the combination of our history and specialized background in the technology, highly refined skills in developing and screening genetic diversity in plant populations, and proprietary TILLING know-how make us a leader in commercial applications of TILLING.

• | Industry leading early phase trait development. Since the inception of the Company we have successfully advanced, and continue to advance, several potentially high value traits from the proof of concept stage to advanced field testing. More recently, in the case of HB4 stress tolerant soybeans we have, through our Verdeca joint venture, advanced the trait beyond field testing and into the regulatory phase. By licensing our traits at a later stage of development, we shorten their development cycle, and reduce the risk and expense associated with bringing products to market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A broad intellectual property portfolio. Arcadia’s patent portfolio includes 137 issued patents with 45 pending applications worldwide, relating to our trait technologies and business methods that are either owned or exclusively controlled by us. Our ability to secure exclusive patent rights to our technologies is a key strength for the Company and one that preserves our competitive position.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expert regulatory affairs capability. Our regulatory team has the proven experience and demonstrated capability to manage regulatory submissions and approvals, including regulatory studies, field trials, regulatory submission, regulatory approvals and commercial launch. Our ability to bring traits through the regulatory process quickly and cost-effectively is a key differentiating factor and a capability we have deployed for our own internal development efforts, as well as in collaboration with our development and commercialization partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a diverse portfolio of products and partners. Our product portfolio consists of a wide variety of traits that are applicable to major crops in key geographic markets and address agricultural yield and product quality. The applicability of our product portfolio to these major crops provides us access to multiple large end markets that we believe have demonstrated or have the potential for high growth, such as soybeans in North and South America and wheat and rice globally.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business by executing the following elements of our strategy:
  
• | Accelerate the commercialization of our nutrition and yield trait portfolio. One of our highest priorities is to broaden the market for our SONOVA GLA product and to accelerate the commercialization of our non-GM ingredient and yield traits, including Resistant Starch wheat, wheat quality and wheat yield. We believe these products can be launched into the market over the next three to five years, and we are working with collaborators who are actively advancing the technical and commercial potential of these products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance commercialization of GM traits in regions where regulatory processes are predictable. Our Verdeca joint venture continues to advance the HB4 Drought Tolerance trait in soybeans towards commercialization in the Americas, with Argentina being the first launch country. Regulatory submissions were made in 2016 for import approval of HB4 soybeans into China. We plan to submit for production approval in Brazil in 2017 and import approval in the European Union in 2018. In the US we have partnered with Dow AgroSciences for the development of yield traits in corn. This program is currently in field testing in multiple locations in the Midwest.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Actively support our licensees’ product development, deregulation and commercialization efforts. Critical to our longer term strategy is unlocking the commercial potential of our key agricultural yield traits, such as Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), Water Use Efficiency (WUE), and Salt Tolerance, in key food crops like rice and wheat. While the ongoing debate about GM crops has delayed regulatory advancements in our most important markets for these traits, we and our partners continue to believe that the value these traits bring to farmers and the impact they will have on food security provide sufficient incentive for all stakeholders to find a way to bring these traits to market. We are actively engaged with our partners to determine and execute optimal strategies to advance these traits through deregulation in these territories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our core capabilities in regulatory, greenhouse and field testing to provide services to the industry. We will deploy the full spectrum of our regulatory services, controlled growth operations and trait evaluation expertise to provide contracted services engagements to drive near-term revenue and support core resources as we build momentum on our trait commercialization pathways.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to invest in our human resources and commercialization capabilities. As we expand our GLA business and introduce our non-GM traits to the nutrition and food quality markets, greater knowledge and industry experience will be required to support those commercial efforts. We will continue to invest in acquisition, development and retention of the requisite management and industry experience that will enable us to continue advancing our position in the agricultural biotechnology marketplace.

Our Products and Product Development Pipeline
 
In the second half of 2016, the Company completed a comprehensive strategic review of its technology programs, product pipeline, partner progress, competitive landscape and market conditions in order to prioritize and appropriately resource its most promising products and opportunities. As a result of this exercise, management undertook a series of initiatives to rationalize program expenses and Company resources against a set of near, mid-term and long-term priorities and expected outcomes. Some programs were terminated or placed on hold, while investments in other programs were accelerated with the aim of generating the highest potential value for the enterprise. The following table summarizes our current product pipeline inclusive of the decisions made by management in the fourth quarter of 2016.

 Productivity Traits, the Yield and Stress Pipeline
 
Arcadia is a recognized leader in the area of yield and abiotic stress and our business was built on the premise that mitigating the impact of environmental stresses, whether chronic or transient, would generate meaningful yield gains in the most important crops in the world. We believe our yield and stress pipeline holds significant promise, as evidenced by our internal data and data generated by our partners in rice, wheat, soy, corn and cotton varieties. The 
 5

commercial value of these types of traits will be fully unlocked as the traits are introgressed into elite germplasm by breeding partners and tested broadly in the field under different environments and agricultural practices. Therefore, while it is our view that the Arcadia pipeline is fairly advanced, significant development and testing has yet to be completed on several of our products as referenced in Phase 3 and Phase 4 of development.
 
Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) 
 
Our NUE technology enables plants to utilize nitrogen fertilizer much more efficiently than conventional plants. This allows crops to achieve significantly higher yields under normally applied levels of nitrogen fertilizer, or to achieve the same yields as conventional crops while using 30 to 50% less nitrogen fertilizer. 
 
Nitrogen fertilizer is a primary plant nutrient and key driver of crop yield. Nitrogen fertilizer is also a significant component of crop production cost. Plant Biotechnology Journal reported that only 30% to 50% of added nitrogen fertilizer is taken up by agricultural crops, with the remainder left unutilized and potentially becoming a significant environmental pollutant.
 
Our NUE technology platform was initially based on a trait discovered at the University of Alberta (Canada), and we hold an exclusive, global license to the technology for use in all crops, with unlimited sublicense rights. Efficacy of this NUE technology has recently been demonstrated in field-grown rice, wheat, and canola by multiple groups.  While we had planned to test NUE cotton lines in the U.S. in 2016, those lines will instead be field tested by our partner, Mahyco.
 
We are collaborating with Dow AgroSciences on development of NUE in corn from technology originating at Dow Agrosciences. Dow AgroSciences is currently evaluating this technology by means of multiple-location U.S. field efficacy tests in hybrid corn. 
 
Positive field test results for our Dow AgroSciences corn collaboration will also help our research team determine whether to apply this separate NUE technology to additional crops like wheat and soybean. We plan to use a combination of NUE technologies in trait stacks to help us maintain and extend our technical and commercial advantage for this important trait area.
 
The target crops and markets for NUE include all major agricultural crops and markets. Our NUE technology has now been incorporated, or is under evaluation by our commercial partners, in major global crops, including rice, wheat, cotton, sugarcane, and multiple forestry species. Field trial data to date in multiple major commodity crops has shown yield improvements greater than 10% attributable to our NUE trait. Additionally, NUE rice tests conducted by independent entities in multiple countries over multiple years have demonstrated that NUE rice lines produced significantly higher grain yield than controls at various nitrogen fertilizer rates. In the paddy low-land production environment, NUE rice lines showed an increase in grain yield of 29.5% at full nitrogen application rates when compared to the parental line. In the rainfed up-land production environment, the NUE rice lines demonstrated 33.8% grain increase at 50% nitrogen application rate.
 
Water Use Efficiency and Drought Tolerance 
 
Our Water Use Efficiency (WUE) trait enables plants to better tolerate two distinct types of stress: reduced or inconsistent water availability, and severe drought. The WUE trait has been demonstrated to improve crop yield under conditions of episodic water stress and to help crops recover from severe drought conditions. A related but distinct technology, Drought Tolerance, helps plants maintain yields under conditions of prolonged water stress. 
 
Modern agriculture is highly water intensive, using approximately 70% of world water withdrawals, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO. UNESCO also estimates that future global agricultural water consumption will increase by about 19% by 2050 and could be even higher if the efficiency of agricultural production does not improve dramatically. The irregular availability of suitable water is one the leading causes of reduced crop yield globally. Loss due to drought in the United States, as reported to the USDA Risk Management Agency, averaged $4.1 billion per year from 2012 through 2016. 
 6


Water-limiting conditions can result from prolonged drought, leading to severe reductions in crop yields, or can result from periodic dry conditions, leading to reduced crop yields. Whenever water limitations occur, economic losses and impairment of the food supply result. 
 
Our WUE trait technology was jointly discovered by researchers at the University of California, Davis and Technion—Israel Institute of Technology. We hold an exclusive, global license to the technology, with sublicense rights, for use in all crops. Greenhouse and field trials of our WUE traits have been completed in agronomic crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, peanuts and alfalfa. We are currently working with collaborators in rice, potato, sugarcane, cotton and multiple tree species.
 
Our Drought Tolerance (DT) technology was discovered by researchers at National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Argentina), and further developed by Bioceres, S.A. Verdeca, our joint venture with Bioceres, Inc., holds exclusive global rights and is developing and commercializing this technology in soybeans. 
 
Our Drought Tolerance technology is most advanced in soybeans. Multiple seasons of field trials under yield reducing conditions that represent the average yield of soybean production in North and South America have shown significant yield improvements relative to controls with no decrease in yield under optimal conditions. The Early Food Safety Evaluation process has been completed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the plant protein responsible for our Drought Tolerance trait. The trait has full approval for food safety and international commerce in Argentina. Regulatory approval application was submitted in 2016 to the FDA and remains under review. Additionally, regulatory approval applications have been submitted in Uruguay and are pending final approval. Regulatory submissions were made in 2016 for import approval of Drought Tolerant HB4 soybeans into China. We plan to submit for commercial release in 2017 with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Further, we plan to submit for production approval in Brazil in 2017 and import approval in the European Union in 2018. 
 
Salinity Tolerance 
 Our Salinity Tolerance trait allows plants to maintain yields under conditions of elevated salinity and is applicable to a wide range of crops, including wheat, rice, soybean, and cotton. Our salt-tolerant plants have also been demonstrated to bind excess salt from the soil into the plant, potentially providing the benefit of rehabilitating salinized land over time.
 
The global cost of lost crop yield to salt-induced land degradation is estimated to be $27.3 billion per year according to the United Nations Natural Resources Forum. Of the current 230 million hectares of irrigated land, 45 million hectares, or about 20%, are salt-affected. Crops grown under salt-affected conditions may be inhibited in two ways. First, the presence of salt in the soil reduces the ability of the plant to take up water, leading to reductions in growth rate. Second, if excessive amounts of salt enter the plant, there can be injury to the cells, which may cause further reductions in growth. Modern agriculture is highly water intensive and the ability to manage crops in saline environments will reduce agricultural demand on critical fresh water supplies.
 
Our most advanced Salinity Tolerance trait technology is based on technology from the University of Toronto, the University of California, Davis, and the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (Japan), all of which have granted us exclusive licenses for all crops. In addition, we are conducting research on additional salinity tolerance genes under a funded research agreement with the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.
 
Target markets for the Salinity Tolerance trait are areas where water or soil salinity decrease crop yield. Such areas occur globally where irrigation is prevalent, where ground water supplies are salinized due to seawater intrusion and where soils are salinized due to mineral deposits. These conditions are common in North America, India, China, additional countries in Asia, Australia, and other major crop production countries. Our Salinity Tolerance trait has been licensed to partners in rice, wheat, cotton, and oilseeds. 
 
Crops with tolerance to soil and water salinity are in various phases of development with our primary licensee and partner for the Salinity Tolerance trait technology. Our partner previously tested the most promising rice lines 
 7

with our trait in a field in which controlled amounts of salt were applied to the replicated plots. In 2015, a field trial was executed on naturally high saline farmlands in India, where grain yields typically are very low, and we saw results similar to those in prior trials. Our partner has developed wheat lines that show significant salinity tolerance under greenhouse conditions, with some lines outperforming the controls by more than 30%, and additional wheat lines are in development to expand the scope of our partner’s first greenhouse evaluations. For salt tolerant cotton, our partner is preparing to conduct outdoor field trials in India.
 
Yield
 Through our Dow AgroSciences collaboration we are evaluating several yield traits in corn through multiple-location U.S. field efficacy tests in hybrid corn. Positive field test results for our Dow AgroSciences corn collaboration will also help our research team determine whether to apply these yield technologies to additional crops like wheat and soybean. We plan to use a combination of these yield traits in stacks to help us develop a competitive technical and commercial advantage for this important trait area.
 
Our non-transgenic wheat yield program, supported by USDA SBIR, aims to increase yield in wheat using TILLING, a non-GM reverse genetics tool, to identify novel alleles of candidate wheat yield genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. These alleles are being evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the field. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory restrictions. With a conservative 5% increase in yield, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over $30 per hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million annually. By incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a commercial wheat breeding program, we believe we can make a significant contribution to improving yield in this vital food crop.
 
Herbicide Tolerance 
 Our Herbicide Tolerance program is currently focused on wheat. We have developed a non-GM source of tolerance to glyphosate, a widely used non-selective herbicide. We believe that the discoveries under this program are applicable to other chemistries and are likely to result in similar opportunities in other major crops.
 
According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications, or ISAAA, from 1996 to 2013, herbicide tolerant crops consistently occupied the largest planting area of biotech crops. In 2013 alone, herbicide tolerant crops occupied 99.4 million hectares, or 57%, of the 175.2 million hectares of biotech crops planted globally. For the first 17 years of commercialization (1996 to 2012), benefits from herbicide tolerant crops were valued at $47.7 billion, which accounted for 41% of global biotech crop value. For 2012 alone, herbicide tolerant crops were valued at $6.6 billion or 35% of global biotech crop value.
 
Our Herbicide Tolerance technology is in Phase 3 of development and was developed using our non-GM TILLING platform. This work is fully funded by a collaborator who has the option to obtain a non-exclusive commercial license to this trait in certain countries. We retain the right to further license this technology to additional collaborators in major wheat markets.
 
Testing results have shown tolerance in multiple alleles to levels of glyphosate herbicide, which may be sufficient to control many weed species in wheat production in certain markets. Individual glyphosate tolerant wheat lines are being combined via plant breeding to combine additional sources of tolerance and create products with increasing levels of tolerance.
 
Heat Tolerance 
 Our Heat Tolerance technology program is carrying out discovery research funded by USAID in collaboration with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, or CIMMYT, and the Indian National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, or NBPGR. Our work targets metabolic approaches to reduce the heat sensitivity of starch synthesis in wheat and increase membrane thermostability. With CIMMYT, we are investigating identified natural 
 8

genetic diversity that affects membrane thermostability and induced genetic diversity in starch synthesis, developed by us, in order to improve wheat heat adaptation in a fundamental way.
 
Among major staple crops, global wheat yields may be the most impacted by climate change, according to a number of climate change models. And while wheat is the most drought-adapted of major crops, improving heat adaptation would make wheat a climate resilient staple. Developing countries are both significant producers and importers of wheat. According to CIMMYT, demand for wheat will increase by 60% by 2050 in developing countries. As we saw with the global food price crisis in 2008, poor yields in major wheat exporting countries such as Australia can have a significant impact on global prices.
 
Agronomic Trait Stacks
 Trait stacks are combinations of multiple individual traits. Trait stacks can be made by using conventional plant breeding to cross plants with different traits, and can also be made by combining multiple traits in a molecular stack that is then inserted into a target crop. Our collaborators are generally allowed to combine multiple traits of ours either by breeding or molecular stacks. Deep portfolios of agronomic stress tolerance traits are rare in the industry, and the ability to pyramid multiples of such traits is even rarer. In order to validate the efficacy of particular trait stacks, we perform our own research and field trials.
 
We are advancing two molecular yield and stress trait stacks and have field-tested them in example crops. Efficacy of a trait stack in one crop suggests the probability that the stack will also work in other key crops. The history of single traits functioning in multiple crops, along with the evidence of stacked traits working in more than one crop, suggests that stacked traits are likely to function in multiple crops.
 
Our most advanced and tested trait stack—the combination of NUE, WUE, and Salinity Tolerance—has been field tested in rice over multiple seasons. We have tested this trait stack under varying levels of nitrogen, water availability, and salinity. Rice plants with this stack out-yielded control plants by 5% to 22% under different levels of nitrogen fertilizer, by 19% to 32% under different types of water stress, and by 27% to 42% under high salinity conditions. 
 
In order to provide a compelling package of trait stacks to corn growers we entered into a strategic collaboration with Dow AgroSciences. Under the collaboration, Arcadia and Dow AgroSciences will jointly develop yield and stress traits, including several traits that have already completed advanced field trials in corn. These traits would then be combined with Dow AgroSciences’ crop protection traits such herbicide tolerance, insect resistance and disease resistance, to create highly competitive trait stacks for commercialization. As part of the agreement, Arcadia can also use the agronomic trait data that we jointly develop in corn to develop and commercialize yield and stress trait stacks in other crops.
 
Agricultural Product Quality Traits
 Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) Oil
 Under a license agreement we have with Abbott, we developed a new source of vegetable oil with very high levels of gamma linolenic acid, or GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid. To our knowledge, our GLA safflower oil product has the highest concentration of GLA available in any plant oil at 65%; conventional plant oils range from 10 to 22% GLA. We sell the oil in the United States and Canada to manufacturers of nutritional supplements, medical foods, and other products. Our key customers include significant participants in those markets, such as GNC, Lindora Nutrition, and others.
 
GLA has multiple clinically-demonstrated nutritional and medical benefits, including anti-inflammation effects, improved skin condition and healthy weight management. Multiple parties have expressed commercial interest in incorporating an enhanced GLA oil into their foods, dietary supplements, or medical products where conventional sources of GLA are not sufficiently concentrated to deliver amounts that are cost- and performance-effective.
 
9

Against a commercial target of 40% GLA concentration, we developed, deregulated and commercialized GLA safflower oil containing up to 65% GLA concentration in fewer than six years. This is significantly fewer than the 13 years it takes, on average, to commercialize a seed using advanced breeding or biotechnology, according to Phillips McDougall. We produce GLA safflower oil by contracting with farmers in Idaho and process the seed under contract with a manufacturer in California to make refined oil. We sell GLA safflower oil under the brand name, SONOVA, with multiple concentrations and formulations.
 
In January, 2017 we received notification from the FDA that our GRAS petition (generally recognized as safe) for the use of SONOVA GLA in medical foods and nutritional beverages had been accepted, which means that we can now market and sell this product in a new market segment. We also filed a petition with the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine for the use of SONOVA GLA in dog food. That petition is currently pending and we expect approval in the first quarter of 2017. We anticipate the pet food approval to generate additional revenue opportunities for our GLA business.
 
Arachidonic Acid (ARA) Oil 
 Arachidonic Acid (ARA) Oil has high levels of the fatty acid ARA, which is a key ingredient in more than 90% of U.S. infant nutrition products. ARA contributes to benefits such as fostering infant eye and brain development. We estimate the global market for ARA at $160 million and believe that our ARA product will cost significantly less than currently available sources of ARA.
 
Our ARA Oil is being developed under agreements with Abbott and DuPont Pioneer, each of which licensed intellectual property to us for this program. In exchange for licenses to intellectual property, these agreements provide product access rights to Abbott and DuPont Pioneer, as well as certain royalty payments on product sales to third parties.
 
We have multiple safflower lines with oil compositions that have the potential of being direct replacements for current sources of ARA in infant nutrition products. We are evaluating near term market distribution opportunities in 2017 with our downstream partners.
 
Enhanced Quality Grains
 We have multiple programs aimed at developing wheat and other small grains with improved nutritional qualities. One such program generated bread and pasta wheat lines with high levels of amylose, a type of resistant starch. Resistant starch increases the total dietary fiber content of wheat and reduces its glycemic index, which are both desirable nutritional qualities that are important in the management of diabetes and healthy blood glucose levels. In 2016 the FDA approved the use of qualified health claims for corn-based resistant starch in the risk reduction of type 2 diabetes, thus establishing a key precedent for the health benefits associated with this fiber. In 2012, the average American consumed 40% of the recommended level of daily dietary fiber, with whole grain consumption representing only 15% of targeted fiber intake and 80% of teenagers eating no whole grains. Grain products make up the largest fiber source in US adults, and thus are the ideal vehicle to deliver improved health benefits to a wide population.
 
A second program aims at improving the flavor profile and shelf-life of whole wheat flour, and is funded by Ardent Mills, which combines the operations of ConAgra Mills and Horizon Milling, a Cargill-CHS joint venture. A third program, funded by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, is aimed at reducing gluten in wheat and other grains. All three of these programs utilize our TILLING platform, and the resulting products are non-GM.
 
Resistant Starch Wheat. Our Resistant Starch (RS) wheat provides a source of wheat with inherently high levels of resistant starch, increasing the total dietary fiber content of food products without the need for fiber additives from other sources such as corn, potato, green banana and cassava. Resistant starch is a key product in two market segments: dietary fiber additives and modified starch additives. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global dietary fibers market is projected to reach $4.31 billion by 2020 and the modified starch market is projected to $11.1 billion in 2020, with food and beverage applications accounting for approximately 50% of this market. Major 
 10

growth in these markets is being driven by the convenience health food sector and functional food sector. Flour from our RS wheat lines has resistant starch levels that are 12 to 20 times higher than the control wheat, and total dietary fiber, or TDF, which is more than eight times higher than the control. RS wheat flour has been tested in applications in bread, where loaf quality was comparable to bread made with conventional wheat flour, and pasta, where it had the highest consumer preference rankings in tests carried out by a major consumer products company.

RS wheat flour is currently being tested in a range of additional bakery, ready-to-eat cereals and pasta products with industrial partners. We have several RS wheat lines that are being evaluated for optimal quality and agronomic characteristics.
Improving Shelf Life of Whole Grain Flour. The USDA recommends that “at least one serving of grains per day must be whole grain-rich” due to evidence that a diet containing whole grains provides a multitude of benefits, including lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Despite these health benefits, consumption of whole grain products is negatively affected by the bitter and rancid flavors and odors that accumulate in whole wheat flour after milling. Our improved stability and flavor wheat lines greatly reduced the production of rancid and bitter compounds in aged whole grain flour. Whole wheat flour from these lines is being tested further for sensory characteristics and improved shelf life stability. These new traits, singly and in combination, could help improve the shelf life and flavor profile of whole grain products, thus reducing formulation costs and increasing consumer preference and palatability for whole grains.

Post Harvest Quality 
 Our post harvest quality program for tomatoes has resulted in tomato lines with significantly increased post-harvest storage life. These tomato lines were developed using our TILLING platform and are non-GM. Our early research program was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, due to their interest in being able to procure quantities of fresh fruit with extended storage life for deployment on board ships and submarines and for overseas missions. The global market for fresh tomatoes is estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation, or FAO, at $84.5 billion per year. Our initial collaborator for this product is Bioseed, a vegetable seed company based in India, and the product is in Phase 4 of development. Additional collaborations in North America are in development.

Identification of New Technology Programs
 Our development strategy has been to leverage upstream investment in basic research to expand our product development pipeline and then collaborate with external partners for the early-stage exploration and identification of promising plant technologies, particularly those related to abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Some of these key early-stage collaborations include programs with the ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Cell Walls (Australia), the University of Adelaide (Australia), CIMMYT (Mexico), the University of California, Davis (United States), Tulane University (United States), the International Center for Research in Semi-Arid Tropics (India), the International Rice Research Institute (the Philippines), the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (Bangladesh), and ICABIOGRAD (Indonesia). Many of these collaborative programs are funded by U.S. government grants that we have secured either ourselves or in connection with our collaboration partners, including grants by USAID, the NIH, the National Science Foundation, and the USDA. Other early-stage technologies have been introduced to us by commercial entities engaged in basic research who may be seeking to partner with us to advance their discoveries to further validation and product development. 
 
12

We have a formal process for evaluating new technology opportunities. We have historically accepted less than 10% of the potential opportunities we have evaluated. Once a promising new trait technology has been accepted, we negotiate an agreement with the technology provider that, at a minimum, enables us to further evaluate the technology for a suitable period of time, or, in some cases, secures rights that enable full research and commercial exploitation of the technology.
 
Technology Evaluation
 Our technology program teams include scientists who are leaders in their respective fields. These teams contribute to the initial evaluation of new opportunities and are responsible for development of technologies brought onboard or developed in-house. Each of our technology programs involves multiple gene, trait and crop targets, and our process focuses on rapid development of the most promising combinations. In the development of any particular trait, we carry out a series of steps including the direct evaluation of target gene function and the specific evaluation of results in key representative crop species. While common core scientific services are provided by functional groups, the technology program team manages overall progress and remains directly involved throughout the development cycle, internally as well as externally with our collaborators.
 
GM and Non-GM Product Development Platforms 
 Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING)—Non-GM Traits. Our TILLING platform enables us to develop value-added crops without the use of GM methods. The TILLING platform is managed by a dedicated team of scientists able to apply TILLING to multiple crops with complex genomes. TILLING technology was originally invented by a member of our science team and utilizes specialized laboratory equipment to carry out high-throughput allele screening of DNA samples from genetic diversity populations created in major crops. Our populations include wheat, rice, soybean, and canola. These populations include numerous native and induced gene function alterations, which can be discovered and evaluated rapidly at low cost and with minimal regulatory requirements. While the TILLING approach is also practiced elsewhere, we believe that the combination of our background in the technology as the first to apply TILLING to crop plants such as wheat and tomato, and our highly refined skills in developing and screening genetic diversity in plant populations makes us a leader in commercial applications of TILLING.
 
Transformation—GM Traits. For projects involving GM traits, the genetic construct for insertion into plants is designed and built by our relevant program team, and then the gene transfer step is accomplished by our plant transformation functional group. This group has developed a complete physical and methodological infrastructure at our laboratory facility in Davis, California to efficiently transfer genetic materials into key crop species. Our team has demonstrated transformation capabilities in all primary and some secondary agricultural crops, including rice (japonica, indica and NERICA types), wheat, corn, canola, safflower, barley, sorghum, alfalfa, tomato, potato, tobacco and grapes.
 
Controlled Growth Operations. Our controlled growth operations group manages our growth chamber facilities, where plants are grown under precisely controlled conditions, and our greenhouse facility, consisting of approximately 26,000 square feet of high quality greenhouse space, which are both at our headquarters in Davis, California. The controlled growth operations group uses these facilities to manage plant experiments and grow-outs under rigorously controlled conditions. They also carry out the initial seed increases and first stages of plant breeding for some projects. For certain projects, such as those relating to oil quality and Resistant Starch wheat, this group also manages crop pre-breeding programs to develop plant varieties for the production of commercial products.
Field Trials and Commercial Production. Our trait evaluation and development group is based in Davis, California and manages remote field operations in American Falls, Idaho and Brawley, California. The group conducts field trials throughout the United States with specialized contractors, and elsewhere globally with our collaborators and joint venture partners. The trait evaluation and development group has extensive field and specialized statistical analytical capabilities that we deploy to support their field trial execution and data analysis internally and with our collaborators.
 
13

Our agricultural operations group manages efficacy and regulatory field trials and, in the case of GLA safflower, commercial crop production. Late-stage field trials are intended to develop extensive data on a limited number of potential commercial plant varieties. These trials may be used to test new varieties developed by our collaborators containing our traits, and to test our own commercial varieties for oil quality and grain quality programs. Similarly, regulatory trials develop data for use in submissions for regulatory review and may involve plant varieties developed by our collaborators or our own oil quality and grain quality programs.
 
Regulatory Data Generation. Our Analytical Services and Regulatory Science, or ASRS, group is located in Davis, California and provides automated DNA preparations, genomic blot analyses, lipid profiling, metabolomics and protein purification services and develops data for use in product selection and validation, certification of SONOVA product specifications, and regulatory submissions. These data support regulatory submissions and provide core trait regulatory packages to our collaborators for use in their crop-specific regulatory applications. 
Biological Materials Inventory and Tracking. Our proprietary Pedigree and Inventory Management System, or PIMS, tracks the genetic, phenotypic and location information for all our plant materials. PIMS encompasses genetic elements such as genes and promoters, GM seeds and plant material received by us, as well as seeds and plants developed by us and used in trait development. The performance of our plant materials is recorded through a variety of laboratory and field observations, and the data are stored within PIMS. The location of all plant materials is tracked throughout the plant life cycle. This includes specific seeds planted within a specific plot of a specific field trial, harvest, seed storage location and use by, or distribution of plant material to, our collaborators or elsewhere. PIMS interfaces with our Biotechnology Quality Management System, or BQMS, to manage all movement and release of regulated GM plant materials. This ensures that all of our plant materials are accounted for, tracked and inventoried, which enables us to maintain control over and documentation of all plant materials.
Regulatory Compliance and Stewardship
 Our regulatory management team provides regulatory services for all of product development programs, as well as joint ventures and selected collaborations. These services include establishing standard operating procedures and best practices, completing regulatory permits and monitoring regulatory and stewardship compliance for all products at all stages. Our regulatory team includes key employees who are directly responsible for leading all global regulatory agency interactions and providing tactical and strategic regulatory direction. Our team collectively has more than 30 years of direct involvement in the development and approvals of GM crops. The key member of our regulatory team was responsible for completing the first FDA and USDA deregulation of a GM whole food. The interactions and processes associated with these first USDA and FDA processes established benchmarks for the regulation of GM products that remain applicable today.
 Our regulatory management and compliance activities encompass three broad categories: deregulation, stewardship, and authorization. In the United States, these activities are regulated by various government agencies, including the USDA, the FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our regulatory team has completed significant regulatory activities (new dietary ingredient review, food additive regulation and GRAS notice) with the FDA Division of Dietary Supplement Programs, with the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, with the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine and with the Health Canada Natural Health Products Directorate.
 Deregulation 
 Our business is subject to regulations related to agriculture, food and the environment. Plant products produced using GM technology are subject to laws and regulations in countries where the plants are grown and in countries where the GM plant-derived food and feed are consumed by humans or animals. Commodity products utilizing our GM traits may require approvals in multiple countries prior to commercialization.
 U.S. Regulatory Agencies:
 U.S. Department of Agriculture. We must obtain USDA authorizations and permits in order to conduct the field releases of regulated materials that are necessary to advance the development of GM crops. Obtaining such 
 14

authorizations and permits is generally routine and delays impacting the planned movement or release of GM material are uncommon. The USDA provides detailed regulations and guidance for obtaining a “Determination of Deregulated Status,” which authorizes the commercial and uncontained growing of GM plants. For regulated GM plants, the USDA requires that a company petition the agency to demonstrate that the product is unlikely to pose a risk. Based on the information provided, the USDA prepares an Environmental Assessment (EA) and/or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in order to make its determination. These procedures afford the public an opportunity to submit written comments on the draft EA or EIS for consideration by the USDA before the final version of the EA or EIS is published. For any GM plant product, there may be delays or requests for additional information based on the USDA’s review or the public comments. As of January 2017, USDA has reached 125 Determinations of Nonregulated Status. Submissions received by the USDA from all applicants prior to 2011 averaged more than 3 years for approval. Since then, the USDA has significantly shortened the time to approval.
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is responsible for food safety under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA recommended in its 1992 Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties that developers of GM plant products consult with the agency about the safety of GM products under development. In 1996, the FDA provided additional guidance to the industry on procedures for these consultations. These procedures require a developer intending to commercialize a food or feed product derived from a GM plant to first meet with the agency to identify and discuss relevant safety, nutritional and other regulatory issues regarding the product. Subsequently, the developer submits to the FDA a scientific and regulatory assessment supporting proposed product safety. The FDA evaluates the submission and engages with the developer to resolve any questions, requests for additional data or other informational requirements. Once the FDA has determined that all requirements have been satisfied, the FDA concludes the consultation process by issuing a letter to the developer acknowledging completion of the consultation process with the addition of the product to the list of completed consultations on the FDA website. The completed consultation acknowledges product safety for use as food and feed. To date, over 150 GM products have completed this process. This process may have delays if the FDA requires additional data and information for its consultation and to resolve any questions the FDA may have. The FDA completed 16 consultations in 2015 and 2016, with consultation time periods in 2016 ranging from 9 to 22 months and averaging 14 months from first submission to conclusion.
 Environmental Protection Agency. Certain products may also be regulated by the EPA, including plants that contain a plant-incorporated protectant, such as a pesticides or herbicide, or plants engineered to be treated with industrial chemicals.
 International Deregulation:
When products from GM crops are expected to be exported from the United States, commercialization of such crops in the United States will require approvals in those countries into which the crops or derivative products, such as grain, oil or meal, will be exported. The laws and regulations for GM plant products are well defined in most commercially significant countries, including Australia, South American countries, India, China, several African countries and the European Union. Typically, our collaborators are responsible for obtaining all regulatory permits and approvals relevant to product development and commercialization in their licensed countries and for generating crop and transformation event-specific data required by their countries of interest. We provide basic safety data on trait expression products in accordance with generally accepted standards. In addition, we may serve as a regulatory consultant and participate in the design of regulatory protocols, data generation and development of detailed regulatory submissions. In certain countries, we may develop strategic business relationships or employ independent consultants with country-specific knowledge and expertise to support and obtain required approvals.
Stewardship 
 Stewardship, or the careful and responsible management of assets, forms the foundation of our regulatory compliance programs associated with GM plants. Our stewardship framework for GM plants is defined by government regulations and related internal policies and practices. In previous years, Arcadia’s Biotechnology Quality Management System (now identified as ABQMS) was developed by us and then audited/certified by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Biotechnology Regulatory Service (APHIS BRS). Recently, USDA updated its BQMS program renaming it the Biotechnology Quality Management Support Program, discontinuing the mandatory auditing/certification standard.
 15

Our ABQMS program was developed to address all conditions required under USDA authority to ensure containment of regulated plant material. The ABQMS includes standard operating procedures, or SOPs, recording and reporting forms, instructions for managing all compliance related activities, and training requirements for all individuals handling GM plant materials. SOPs are highly detailed and consider all elements of each relevant activity or process. Each field trial site is accompanied by a Field Compliance Guide and Record (GUIDE) containing multiple SOPs and associated forms for each activity. For example, a GM wheat trial requires 19 SOPs and associated verification forms. A GUIDE is completed for each regulated field trial and serves as a completed record to support compliance with government regulations. Example copies of the GUIDE have been provided to our collaborators for use in other countries where they conduct GM field trials.
 Our ABQMS is audited annually by our compliance manager and previously by an independent auditor trained and supervised by the USDA. Since our ABQMS program was first recognized by the USDA in 2011, each annual independent audit conducted by USDA until discontinuation of their audit program confirmed that our program was functioning as intended. Our ABQMS manager has attended USDA BQMS training programs at the request of the USDA to assist in training personnel at other companies and organizations and to share our experience and the SOPs that form the basis of our program.
 Compliance with the specific parameters of regulatory requirements is only one element of stewardship. Additional activities within each functional group throughout the company are integral to the overall stewardship program. Each of our employees is trained on, and must comply with, relevant stewardship guidelines as defined and described in our ABQMS.
 Authorization 
 The USDA APHIS Biotechnology Regulatory Service (BRS) has legal and regulatory authority over the movement and release of GM plants and seeds. “Movement” includes movement of regulated GM plant material between states and the importation of regulated GM plant material into the United States. “Release” includes field trials of any size and any other use of regulated GM plant material outside of contained greenhouses.
 We have obtained more than 200 authorizations from the BRS for the movement, importation or release of GM plants under development. General and specific conditions to maintain containment during all activities associated with the movement or release are a requirement of each authorization. These conditions are defined, applied and recorded in the GUIDE following our ABQMS program.
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and contractual protection of our proprietary know-how and confidential information, to preserve our competitive position.
 As of December 31, 2016, we owned or exclusively controlled 137 issued patents and 45 pending patent applications worldwide. As of this date, we owned 11 and exclusively in-licensed 18 U.S. patents and we owned seven and exclusively in-licensed one pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications relating to our trait technologies and business methods. Also, as of this date, we owned 11 and exclusively in-licensed 97 foreign patents and owned 22 and exclusively in-licensed 15 pending foreign patent applications. With respect to all of the foregoing patent assets, our exclusive licenses afford us control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications. These numbers do not include in-licensed patents for which we either do not have exclusive rights (such as certain enabling technology licenses), or for which we have exclusive rights only in a limited field of use or do not control prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents.
 As of December 31, 2016, we had eight registered trademarks in the United States. As of this date, we also had eight registered trademarks in various other countries.
 We also have entered into in-license agreements enabling the use and commercialization of our traits, including NUE, WUE and Salinity Tolerance, and certain products that we have commercialized or are under development, including GLA safflower oil and ARA safflower oil. Under these licensing arrangements, we are 
 16

obligated to pay royalty fees on sublicense revenue and net product sales ranging between low single digit percentages and percentages in the mid-teens, subject in certain cases to aggregate dollar caps. The exclusivity and royalty provisions of these agreements are generally tied to the expiration of underlying patents. After the termination of these provisions, we and our collaborators may continue to produce and sell products utilizing the technology under the expired patents. While third parties thereafter may develop products using the technology under the expired patents, in many cases, we have incremental patent rights covering our most important technologies, which we believe mitigate the impact of the expiration of these patents, or the related exclusivity provisions, on our business. We also have numerous in-licenses relating to enabling technologies utilized in our development programs, such as transformation methods (e.g., Japan Tobacco, DuPont Pioneer), genome editing tools (e.g., Dow AgroSciences), promoters (e.g., Dow AgroSciences, Louisiana State University) and selectable marker technologies (e.g., Bayer). These in-licenses are non-exclusive and include some combination of upfront and annual license fees, milestone fees, and commercial royalty obligations consisting of low percentages or a low dollar per acre fee.
 Below is a summary of those in-license agreements that we believe are most significant for our more advanced product development programs.
 University of Alberta. We hold an exclusive license from University of Alberta to the patent portfolio that formed the basis of our NUE program, which began in 2002. In exchange for an upfront license fee and royalties on sublicense revenues and net product sales (which are capped at an aggregate amount in the mid-seven figures), and subject to the University’s right to perform academic research using the technology, we exclusively control all research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.
 Blue Horse Labs. In conjunction with a sponsored research and development agreement entered into in 2003, we obtained an exclusive license from Blue Horse Labs, an affiliate entity of our majority stockholder, Moral Compass Corporation, for technology related to several of our development programs. Under the sponsored research and development agreement, Blue Horse Labs has an ownership right in patents covering technology that was developed using Blue Horse Labs funds, including certain NUE and GLA safflower patents. In the corresponding license agreement, in exchange for a single-digit royalty on net revenues and management of all aspects of the patent portfolio, we exclusively control all research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.
 University of California, Davis. Our WUE technology was developed under an exclusive option agreement with the University of California, Davis, pursuant to which we exercised our right to secure an exclusive license in 2010. We also hold an exclusive license from University of California, Davis, to the patent portfolio that forms the basis of our Salinity Tolerance program. In exchange for an upfront license fee, license maintenance fees, and royalties on sublicense revenues and net product sales, we exclusively control all for-profit research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops. 
 University of Toronto. We hold an exclusive license from University of Toronto to the patent portfolio that forms the basis of our Salinity Tolerance program. In exchange for an upfront license fee, a royalty on revenues, and payment of all costs associated with the patent portfolio, and subject to the University’s right to use the technology for research and teaching purposes, we exclusively control all for-profit research, development, commercialization and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.
 Abbott. We entered into a license and development agreement with Abbott in 2003 under which we have been granted limited exclusive rights to Abbott’s portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents relating to the development of plant-based sources of GLA, ARA and essential fatty acids. Under this agreement, we provide Abbott with preferential access to commercial products from our GLA and ARA safflower programs, as well as the right to receive royalty payments on product sales to third parties, in exchange for the licenses to Abbott’s intellectual property rights.
 
Dow AgroSciences. In December 2015, we announced the entry into a strategic collaboration with Dow AgroSciences to develop and commercialize new yield traits and trait stacks in corn. The collaboration leverages our platform of abiotic stress traits with Dow AgroSciences’ enabling technology platforms, input traits, regulatory 
 17

capabilities and commercial channels. As part of the strategic partnership, we negotiated non-exclusive access to Dow AgroSciences’ EXZACT™ Precision Technology Platform to enhance and accelerate the development of trait stacks. Dow AgroSciences has developed the EXZACT™ Precision Technology Platform under an exclusive license and collaboration agreement in plants with Sangamo BioSciences, Inc.
Key Collaborations 
 Since our founding in 2002, we have established numerous trait collaborations and have developed deep relationships with industry-leading seed and consumer product companies. Our partnerships with global strategic seed and consumer product players enable us to further participate in the development and commercialization of innovative products that promise to play significant roles in improving global crop efficiency and enhancing human health. The results of these collaborations directly feed innovation and drive the progress of our ongoing programs. Moreover, the expertise and opportunities created by the collaborations represent important assets to our business. While our collaboration-focused business model has resulted in numerous strategically significant relationships, below is a summary of selected collaborative partnerships that we view as key to the achievement of our near-term and mid-term business objectives.
Mahyco
 We have multiple agreements with Mahyco covering more than 15 programs, using our most advanced traits in multiple major crops, and have been working with Mahyco as a key partner since 2007. Our collaborations in NUE rice and salt tolerant rice are in advanced stages of development.
 Under our various agreements relating to our NUE, WUE, and Salinity Tolerance traits, Mahyco has exclusive research and commercial rights in all licensed geographies and must timely meet certain diligence milestones in order to maintain their exclusivity. Each of our collaboration agreements with Mahyco includes an upfront technology access fee, technical and regulatory milestone fees, and, once products utilizing our traits are commercialized, we are entitled to receive a portion of the commercial value of seeds sold by Mahyco incorporating our traits. Rights to new intellectual property developed under a collaboration agreement are owned by the inventing party or parties.
 Vilmorin & Cie (Limagrain)
 We selected Limagrain as our strategic partner and collaborator in wheat—the world’s largest crop by area grown and the third most valuable at $186.4 billion annual value—due to their position as the leading global breeder and marketer of wheat seeds. In 2009, we executed an agreement with Limagrain under which we partnered to develop and commercialize NUE wheat in all countries of the world except Australia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Under our agreement, Limagrain has exclusive research and commercial rights in all licensed geographies except North America and South America, in which we retained co-exclusive rights, and Limagrain must timely meet diligence milestones to maintain exclusivity. Our agreement with Limagrain includes an upfront technology access fee, annual maintenance fees, and technical and regulatory milestone fees, and once an NUE wheat product is commercialized, we are entitled to receive a portion of the commercial value of the trait in the marketplace. We and Limagrain have since coordinated with collaborators in Australia to align development efforts in NUE wheat on a global basis.
 In 2010, we further expanded our relationship with Limagrain from collaborator to stockholder and joint venture partner. Contemporaneously with Limagrain’s $25.0 million equity investment in our company, we formed Limagrain Cereal Seeds LLC, a joint venture company focused on the development and commercialization of improved wheat seed in North America, of which a U.S. wholly owned subsidiary of Limagrain owns 65% and we own 35%. 
 We are currently discussing a proposal with Limagrain whereby Limagrain would exchange its ownership interest in Arcadia for Arcadia’s ownership interest in Limagrain Cereal Seeds.  After collaborative discussion with Limagrain, we believe the Company can achieve its business goal of bringing high value yield and quality traits to the wheat market without having to incur the additional expense of operating a wheat seed business. Both Arcadia 
 18

and Limagrain remain committed to a partnership in wheat and are diligently working to determine the optimal structure for our strategic collaboration.  Although there can be no assurances that the exchange will be consummated, we expect to complete the cashless exchange in late March 2017.
 Bioceres
 In 2012, we partnered with Bioceres, an Argentina-based technology company, to form Verdeca LLC, a U.S.-based joint venture company engaged in the development and deregulation of soybean traits, of which we own 50%. We selected Bioceres as our partner in soybeans—the world’s fourth largest crop by area grown and the fourth most valuable at $119.0 billion annual value—due to their desirable trait portfolio, their presence in key South American markets, and the significant presence of large soybean growers in their ownership structure.
 Our joint venture agreement provides for each of the joint venture partners to license its trait technologies to Verdeca for use in soybeans, with product development and regulatory efforts equitably divided and managed by us and Bioceres under stand-alone service agreements that are executed annually. The first product in the Verdeca pipeline is a drought and abiotic stress tolerance trait that has already completed extensive validation trials and is now in the regulatory phase of development. This trait has been demonstrated to confer as high as a 14% yield advantage over conventional soybeans grown under the same suboptimal conditions. In April 2015, Verdeca received the first regulatory approval of its stress tolerance trait in soybeans in Argentina. This is the world’s first regulatory approval of an abiotic stress tolerance trait in soybeans, which we believe is an important initial step in pursuing additional regulatory approvals that Verdeca intends to seek in multiple geographies globally. Verdeca has successfully negotiated favorable market access in South America through established players and is working on adding market channel partners in the United States, India, and China.
 In addition to those agreements with Bioceres directly associated with Verdeca, we also have negotiated exclusive access to Bioceres’ drought and abiotic stress tolerance trait for use globally, outside of South America, in wheat. Our agreement with Bioceres provides for sharing of trait value once a product is commercialized.
 In April 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Dow AgroSciences and Bioceres under which our Verdeca joint venture will collaborate with Dow AgroSciences on the development and deregulation of soybean traits on a global basis.
 Dow AgroSciences
 In December 2015, we announced the entry into a strategic collaboration with Dow AgroSciences to develop and commercialize new yield traits and trait stacks in corn. The collaboration leverages our platform of abiotic stress traits with Dow AgroSciences’ enabling technology platforms, input traits, regulatory capabilities, and commercial channels. 
 Under the collaboration, we and Dow AgroSciences will jointly fund, develop and commercialize agronomic yield traits, such as nutrient efficiency and water use efficiency, including several traits that already are in advanced field trials in corn. These traits would then be combined with Dow AgroSciences’ input traits to create highly competitive trait stacks that maximize farmer revenue and efficiency.
 Scientific Advisory Board 
 We maintain a scientific advisory board consisting of the members identified below. Our scientific advisory board meets on a quarterly basis and is comprised of industry and academic experts that have extensive experience in the analysis, research and development, and commercialization of biotech plants, including experience relating to discovery, transformation, and field trials. We consult with our scientific advisory board on a variety of matters pertaining to our current and future pipeline of products in development, including, for example, trait selection and development, transformation and TILLING methodologies, field trials, regulatory matters, and intellectual property evaluation.
 19

We currently have a scientific advisory board that consists of five members as follows:
 Eduardo Blumwald, Ph.D. is a professor at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Blumwald’s research program is multidisciplinary in nature, combining physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, genomics, and proteomics. The general objectives of his work are: (i) the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate ion homeostasis in plants; (ii) the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the responses of plants to abiotic stress (e.g., salt, drought, and heat); (iii) the biochemical and molecular basis of sugar and acid accumulation in fruits; and (iv) the development of genomic and proteomic resources for the improvement of fruit quality. Dr. Blumwald has worked closely with our scientists from the time of his former position with the University of Toronto.

 Luca Comai, Ph.D. is a professor of plant biology at the University of California, Davis Genome Center. Dr. Comai’s lab is involved in two areas pertinent to breeding. In the first, they study genome regulation, hybridization, and heterosis responses in chromosome copy number variants and interspecific hybridization. In the second, they develop methods and resources for functional genomic discovery, including TILLING, which allows targeted inactivation of genes in crop plants. The research combines plant genetics and genomics with the use of next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics and genome editing to identify genes responsible for traits of interest as well as to discover and use natural and induced variation. Dr. Comai is known for his pioneering work creating glyphosate tolerant crops, and as a founding scientist in Calgene Pacific, Targeted Growth, Inc. and Tilligen. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Competition 
 The markets for seed traits and agricultural biotechnology products are highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. Competition for improving plant genetics comes from conventional and advanced plant breeding techniques, as well as from the development of 
 20

advanced biotechnology traits. Other potentially competitive sources of improvement in crop yields include improvements in crop protection chemicals, fertilizer formulations, farm mechanization, other biotechnology, and information management. Programs to improve genetics and chemistry are generally concentrated within a relatively small number of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with broader set of companies.
 In general, we believe that our competitors generally fall into the following categories:
  
• | Large Agricultural Biotechnology, Seed, and Chemical Companies: According to Phillips McDougall, the leading 11 seed and trait companies as a group invested $4.1 billion in seed and trait research and development in 2013. This includes conventional and advanced plant breeding, as well as biotechnology trait development. According to Phillips McDougall, only a limited number of companies have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization: Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, BASF, Bayer, Dow, KWS, and Genective (a joint venture between KWS and Limagrain). Many of these companies have substantially larger budgets for gene discovery, research, development, and product commercialization than we do. Some of these companies also have substantial resources and experience managing the regulatory process for new GM seed traits. Each of Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Dow, and Bayer, which accounted for 85% of the 2013 seed trait research and development spend noted above, also have significant chemical crop protection background and businesses. The trait pipelines of these companies are heavily weighted toward biotic stress traits, although they also have significant programs aimed at development of abiotic stress traits. While these companies have internal programs that may compete with our own, they also seek new traits externally and, as such, some of them either currently are, or may in the future be, our collaborators. In addition, some of these companies are currently among our sources for new trait technologies.

• | Trait Research and Development Companies: There are a number of companies that specialize in research and development of agricultural yield and product quality traits, and we believe that a dozen or more companies, including Evogene and Keygene, among others, are competitors in our field. We believe that these companies typically focus on a limited number of traits, and do not generally have the product development and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market. Therefore, they typically license trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies Focused on the Development and Commercialization of Microbial Crop Enhancements: The use of microbial products to enhance crop performance via application to soil, seed, or to crops directly is an area where increased research and development activity has been underway for the past decade or more. We believe that there are more than 20 companies of varying size working in this space. There have been a number of acquisitions, including Becker Underwood by BASF, and joint collaborations in this space, but multiple independent companies remain, including Verdesian, Marrone Bioinnovations, Biagro and Bioconsortia. While these companies could be considered to compete with us as their products seek to improve crop yields, we believe that such products and our traits may be additive, or synergistic, to our future products in terms of increasing crop yields.

• | Companies Focused on Farming Data Management, or Precision Agriculture: Within the past several years there has been a rapid increase in technologies and companies focused on acquiring, analyzing, and acting upon data in ways that may improve farm economics via increased crop yield and more efficient management of crop production inputs. Technical approaches include weather prediction and monitoring, high-density field and crop imaging systems, precision field soil and yield mapping, and others. Companies focusing on this space include Climate Corporation (acquired by Monsanto), Farmers Business Network, Farmers Edge, Trimble, Planet Labs, Ceres Imaging, Blue River Technologies, and others. While these products are potentially competitive with us for increasing crop yields, we believe that certain of these products could also be additive or synergistic with our traits.

• | Agricultural Research Universities and Institutions: Given the global importance of agriculture, numerous agricultural research universities and institutions around the world focus on basic and applied research aimed at increasing crop yield. According to the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators, global public spending on agricultural research and development in 2008 totaled $31.7 billion, having increased by 22% during the years from 2000 to 2008. Spending in 2008 in high income

countries accounted for approximately 51% of the total, while spending in low and middle income countries accounted for 49% of the total. The United States was the largest contributor of public agriculture funding in 2008 with a total investment of $4.8 billion. Most of this publicly funded research is focused on basic research. Many public research programs aim to understand basic biological processes and do not necessarily engage in further development and commercialization of discovered traits. While these programs are potentially competitive with us, we view them primarily as sources of innovation that fit with our business model. We have an established track record of working closely and effectively with public research programs, including a number from the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, Spain, Ireland, and elsewhere.

 We believe that we are uniquely positioned at the nexus of basic research and commercial product development. Unlike many companies in our space, we generally do not compete in the area of basic research. Our focus is on development and validation and, therefore, we provide a value-added link by which basic research can be brought to market. While internal programs at the largest seed and technology companies are competitive with ours in some cases, we are technology providers to some of these companies, and we have numerous collaborations with many of them. To remain competitive, we plan to pursue multiple strategies, including further building our non-GM pipeline of new technologies from basic research programs, increasing the scope and range of our field testing activities, and continuing to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions globally.
 Research and Development 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 30 full-time employees dedicated to research and development, six of whom are development and field personnel focused on demonstration and research field trials. Our research and development team has technical expertise in molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and genetic engineering, analytical chemistry, plant physiology, plant virology, molecular pathogenesis, and soil and water science. Our research and development activities are conducted principally at our Davis, California facility, with ongoing field trials conducted in American Falls, Idaho; Brawley, California, Yuma, Arizona; and numerous other locations throughout the United States, as well as locations managed by our collaborators worldwide. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in research and development. Our research and development expenses were $8.7 million and $9.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 57 full-time employees, of whom 8 hold Ph.D. degrees. Approximately 30 employees are engaged in research and development activities, three in business development, two in regulatory management, and 22 in management, operations, accounting/finance, legal and administration. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement.
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Davis, California, in a facility consisting of approximately 20,775 square feet of office, laboratory and growth chamber space under a lease that expires on June 30, 2018, pursuant to which we have an option to renew the lease for an additional three-year term. This facility accommodates research and development, operations, analytical services, regulatory and administrative activities. In December 2016, in connection with our organizational streamlining, we committed to consolidate our research facilities and began to wind down our Seattle research location, which is operating on a month-to-month lease, effective January 1, 2017. We expect the transfer of equipment and skills from our Seattle facility to be completed by March 2017. Our administrative offices in Phoenix, Arizona, consist of 2,976 square feet under a lease that expires on June 30, 2018 and accommodate our finance, legal and other administrative activities, as well as sales and marketing activities for our SONOVA products. We lease greenhouse space and farm land for agricultural use in Northern California as well as farmland in Idaho. We also lease grain bin and office space in Idaho under a lease that expires on March 3, 2019.
 We believe that our leased facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that, if needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.
