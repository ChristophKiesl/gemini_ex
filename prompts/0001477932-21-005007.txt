Item 1: Business
Corporate Information
 
MMEX was formed as a Nevada corporation in 2005. The current management team led an acquisition of the Company (then named Management Energy, Inc.) through a reverse merger completed in 2010 and changed the Company’s name to MMEX Mining Corporation in 2011 and then to MMEX Resources Corporation in 2016. Our mailing address is 3616 Far West Blvd #117-321, Austin, Texas 78731. Our physical office address is 107-A S. Main Street, Fort Stockton, Texas 79735. The Company has adopted a fiscal year end of April 30.
Company Overview
 
Since 2016, the focus of our business has been to build crude oil distillation units and refining facilities (CDUs) in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We revised our business plan in 2021 to move MMEX to clean energy use and production, leveraging our history, management and business relationships from the traditional energy sector. The focus of our business plan is to

· | Modify our planned CDU projects in Pecos County (West Texas) to produce potentially hydrogen and ultra-low sulfur fuel products combined with CO2 capture.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Purchase additional acreage allowing us to develop additional megawatts of solar power for distribution to our projects in West Texas. 

 
Our immediate plans are to pursue the following three projects:
 
Project 1: Ultra Fuel clean refining.
 
We have teamed with Polaris Engineering to develop a clean refining, 10,000 barrel per day facility at our Pecos County site to produce 87° gasoline, ultra-low sulphur diesel and low-sulphur fuel oil, utilizing the Ultra Fuels concept. The Ultra Fuels concept features small size facilities to take advantage of proximity to smaller markets and/or locate directly near crude oil production areas. Because equipment is fabricated in modular units in the USA and shipped to site, this allows for 15 to 18 months’ project completion time and more rapid implementation than traditional facilities. The smaller size and footprint, as well as lower emissions, also allows for faster permitting.

Project 2: Blue Hydrogen
 
We have teamed with Black Tree Group to develop a facility in Pecos County to produce hydrogen with carbon capture and storage employing steam methane reformer technology with the abundant natural gas supplies in the immediate area as the feedstock. 
Project 3: Green Hydrogen
 
This planned project will be a parallel plant in Pecos County, which plans to utilize the proprietary electrolyzer technology of a major international technology partner. The facility will utilize solar power, with water purification, to produce up to 50 tons of hydrogen production per day. 
 
We are in various stages of negotiations with major company off-takes that range from specialty air and gas companies to international trading companies. We would expect the sales of hydrogen by these companies will be to their customer base, which are more traditional chemical end uses. The proposed distribution network of liquid hydrogen from our planned projects will be by truck and rail. 
 
Completion of these projects is dependent upon our obtaining the necessary capital for planning, construction and start-up costs. We are in consultation with the local and state tax authorities to file for tax abatement treatment generally applicable to projects such as our H2 projects. However, neither the receipt of adequate capital or tax abatement treatment can be assured.
 
The New Hydrogen Economy
 
The energy systems both in the United States and internationally are rapidly evolving. Major energy companies, regulatory agencies and all segments of society are working toward decarbonization and preservation of natural resources. In the interim, however, we need electric power and transportation energy. Hydrogen, as the most abundant fuel in the universe, is an energy carrier that cuts across sectors and has multiple benefits. 
 
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe; however, it is rarely found in its elemental form on earth. It must be produced from a hydrogen-containing feedstock (e.g., water, biomass, fossil fuels, or waste materials) using an energy source. Once hydrogen is produced, it can be used to store, move, and deliver low- or no-carbon energy to where it is needed. Hydrogen can be stored as a liquid, gas, or chemical compound, and is converted to energy via traditional combustion methods (in engines, furnaces, or gas turbines), through electrochemical processes (in fuel cells), and through hybrid approaches such as integrated combined cycle gasification and fuel cell systems. It is also used as a feedstock or fuel in a number of industries, including petroleum refining, ammonia production, food and pharmaceutical production, and metals manufacturing. Hydrogen can be produced in large centralized production facilities or in smaller distributed production facilities, and can be transported via truck, pipeline, tanker, or other means. Hydrogen, as a versatile energy carrier and chemical feedstock, offers advantages that unite all of our nation’s energy resources—renewables, nuclear, and fossil fuels—and enables innovations in energy production and end uses that can help decarbonize three of the most energy intensive sectors of our economy: transportation, electricity generation, and manufacturing.
 
Supplying hydrogen to industrial users is now a major business globally. Demand for hydrogen, which has grown more than threefold since 1975, continues to rise. Demand for hydrogen in its pure form is approximately 70 million tons per year. Governments are recognizing hydrogen’s role in energy security and its ability to decarbonize sectors that are otherwise extremely difficult to abate – such as logistics, industrial heating and industry feedstock. Meanwhile, industry leaders across the automotive, chemicals, oil and gas and heating sectors look to low-carbon and renewable hydrogen as a serious alternative to reach their increasingly robust sustainability objectives.

Management Expertise in Oil, Gas, Refining and Electric Power Project Development and Project Finance Development

MMEX management has over 30 years of experience in natural resource project development and project financing in North and South America and the U.K. In addition, MMEX directors and principal stockholders with oil, gas, refining and electric power experience will bring this expertise into the Company.
 
MMEX principals formed Maple Resources Corporation (“Maple Resources”) in 1986 to engage in the evaluation, acquisition and development of oil & gas, refining, power generation, natural gas transmission and processing energy projects in the western United States and Latin America. Maple Resources and its principals have engaged in a number of oil and gas acquisitions and dispositions and ultimately acquired assets that included 10 gas processing plants and approximately 770 miles of natural gas gathering lines and transmission infrastructure. In 1992, Maple Resources sold substantially all of its existing US-based assets and began to pursue energy projects in Latin America, particularly in Peru through its affiliate The Maple Gas Corporation del Peru Ltd (“Maple Peru”). In 1993, Maple Peru began developing the Aguaytía Project, an integrated natural gas and electric power generation and transmission project. This US$273 million project involved the first commercial development of a natural gas field in Peru, as well as the construction and operation of approximately 175 miles of hydrocarbon pipelines, a gas processing plant, a fractionation facility, a 153 MW power plant and the related 392 km of electricity transmission lines. The Aguaytía Project began commercial operation in 1998. Maple Peru also acquired a 4,000-bpd refinery in Pucallpa along with 3 producing oil fields.
 
Jack Hanks, our President and CEO, is no longer engaged in the active business operations of Maple Peru and is able to devote substantially all of his business time to his duties on behalf of the Company. Further, we do not anticipate that Maple Resources will present any conflicts of interest for the MMEX principals in carrying out their responsibilities on behalf of the Company. 
 
Proposed Organizational Structure
 
The Company expects to operate its planned projects through subsidiaries. The construction of the planned projects will require substantial equity and debt financing, far beyond the expected resources of the Company, and we anticipate that the subsidiaries will obtain equity and debt financing to finance the cost of construction. To the extent these subsidiaries raise money through the issuance of equity securities, our ownership in the subsidiaries will be diluted and our economic ownership of such entities may be a minority interest. As such, we will be entitled to only a portion of any future distributions made by these subsidiaries. In addition, while intend to retain managerial control of the subsidiaries, it is likely that equity investors will require representation on the board of managers in connection with their equity investments.
 
We anticipate these subsidiaries will be able to finance a majority of the total costs of the planned projects through debt financing, and the remaining portion of the total costs would be financed through equity investments. We intend to pursue the required debt financing from banks or other large institutional investors. Traditionally, such debt financing is in the form of project financing, which among other terms will require the project subsidiary to restrict its activities to the operation of the project financed by the lender, to pledge all assets of the project to the lender and to be subject to restrictive financial covenants. Such lenders further typically require engineering, marketing and feasibility studies as a condition precedent to the financing. The Company will have to fund the cost of these reports and studies. 
 
Regulation
 
Although we do not believe our planned blue hydrogen and green hydrogen projects will have any significant environmental or ecological impact, we will be subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations relating to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the soil, groundwater, and surface water, and measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. There are risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases of crude oil or hazardous substances from our pipelines or storage facilities. To the extent an event is not covered by our insurance policies, accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations.

We expect to file with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) for construction and operation permits. We expect to employ carbon capture with the clean fuels and blue hydrogen facilities. We are studying the options for sequestration for the CO2 in the various saline formations under our sites, which will require permits from the EPA or the Texas Railroad Commission (which, we understand, is in the process of seeking primacy for sequestration permitting). 
 
Our planned operations may also be subject to the Department of Homeland Security’s Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities, and to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines and Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. If applicable, we will have to have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with all of these requirements, and we will need to develop a Facility Security Plan as required under the relevant law. We will also have to have in place procedures to monitor compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of all our facilities.
 
Our planned operations will also be subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We may also become subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. We will take measures to ensure that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
 
Employees

As of April 30, 2021, we had no employees but rather to reduce costs our key management team is working under consulting agreements. We contract for all professional services when needed. Our two directors have not received any compensation for their service on the Board.
