Item 1.         Business.

Harris & Harris Group, Inc.® (the "Company," "us," "our," and "we"), is an internally managed investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, (the "1940 Act"). For tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). However, as is discussed in detail in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we did not qualify as a RIC in 2016, but we had no taxable income. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of New York in August 1981. We are overseen by our Board of Directors and managed by our officers and have no external investment adviser.

 Historically, our investment objective has been to achieve long-term capital appreciation investing in venture capital investments. Our focus was making investments in transformative companies enabled by what we believed was disruptive science. More recently, we have focused our investments on transformative companies in precision health and medicine. We then provided strategic, operational and management resources, and creative financial solutions to these companies. While we will continue to provide such resources to our existing portfolio companies, including our precision health and medicine companies, our investment objective on future new investments will be focused on generating capital appreciation and current income from investments in what we believe are deeply undervalued, small publicly traded companies where we believe we can positively impact the business and valuation through constructive activism.
We believe we combine new perspectives with the historical knowledge and experience of managing the current portfolio. We believe these complementary sets of experiences and skills in investment management and in working with management teams to build businesses can be a foundation for future growth. We believe we will be able to generate income and grow net asset value per share for shareholders over shorter, more predictable timeframes than we have experienced historically.

While there are multiple fund managers that invest in smaller publicly traded companies, we believe that these managers are often not able to engage or interested in engaging with such companies on an active basis. We believe our expertise and focus on constructive activism could be an attractive complement to other investors in the space. Our new simplified structure and focus could lead to partnerships or other opportunities. We believe that the universe of potential partners on this strategy is substantially larger than those focused on privately held investments. We believe we will be in a strong position to seek these strategic partnership opportunities with the current and future assets of our company.
We believe we provide four core benefits to our shareholders. First, our go-forward investment strategy offers investors the opportunity to leverage our experience, extensive diligence and active portfolio management of what we believe are significantly undervalued publicly traded companies that may be difficult to replicate on an individual basis. Second, we provide shareholders with access to an existing privately held portfolio of disruptive companies that we believe may yield significant returns on invested capital in the future. Third, we provide access for accredited investors to co-invest with us in our portfolio companies when we acquire pre-emptive rights and either lack sufficient capital to fully exercise those rights, or otherwise determine that such investment is not appropriate for us. Fourth, we are able to invest opportunistically in multiple types of securities to take advantage of market inefficiencies.
Proposals to Withdraw Election to be Treated as a BDC and Change of Corporate Name
We recently filed a definitive proxy statement proposing that the Company obtain shareholder approval to withdraw our election to be treated as a BDC and to change our name from Harris & Harris Group, Inc., to 180 Degree Capital Corp. ("180"). Concurrent with the withdrawal of the election, we would immediately register as a closed-end investment company (hereinafter, a "Registered Closed-End Fund"). As a Registered Closed-End Fund, we would remain subject to many of the same provisions of the 1940 Act that we are subject to as a BDC. We are proposing to convert from a BDC to a Registered Closed-End Fund because we believe that certain provisions of corporate law and the 1940 Act will enable us to operate with a lower expense ratio. We believe this change will increase returns to investors, while allowing us to maintain a comparable investment strategy. Such provisions include:

• | Less frequent and less complex reports filed with the SEC; and


• | Exemption of Registered Closed-End Funds from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

We currently expect that the transition from a BDC to a Registered Closed-End Fund will enable us to reduce our annual operating expenses attributable to regulatory and compliance costs. 
1

Our priority with the proposed name change is to reflect the focus of our future business and to provide the opportunity to re-brand the firm. Initially, 180 will be focused on shepherding the existing portfolio of investments to maximize returns, with what we believe will be less regulatory burden and expense to shareholders than in a BDC structure. 180’s future business will be focused on making decisions that are designed to generate income and grow net asset value per share for shareholders over shorter, more predictable timeframes. Toward this goal, and as discussed above, 180 will focus on investing in and providing value-add assistance through constructive activism to what 180’s management team believes are substantially undervalued small, publicly traded companies that have potential for aggressive growth. Our goal is that the result of our constructive activism leads to a reversal in direction for the share prices of these investee companies, i.e., a 180-degree turn.
Summary of our Current Portfolio

As of December 31, 2016, we held equity in two publicly traded portfolio companies that we believe are undervalued and where we have engaged in constructive activism in an effort to improve shareholder value:

There are three main drivers of our potential growth in value from these companies over the coming years. First, we have a larger portfolio of more mature companies than we have had historically. Second, we believe the quality of our existing portfolio is stronger than it has been historically. Third, we own larger percentages of more companies in the existing portfolio than we have owned historically.

In previous communications with shareholders, we have discussed how we are managing our portfolio in an effort to maximize our value at exit. We currently believe D-Wave Systems, Inc., Adesto Technologies Corporation, HZO, Inc., Interome, Inc. (renamed HALE.life Corporation in 2017) and AgBiome, LLC, may have the potential to be real drivers of realized returns from our portfolio in the coming years.

We currently plan to return to shareholders a portion of future realized gains from our maturing investments in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $2.5 million of the Company’s common stock in the open market within a six-month period. As of December 31, 2015, we had repurchased 509,082 shares. During the first quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors reauthorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2.5 million of the Company’s common stock in the open market within a six-month period from the proxy mailing date of April 29, 2016. This six-month period expired on October 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, our Board of 
3

Directors again reauthorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 million of the Company's common stock within a six-month period from the date of notice to investors, which has yet to be determined. There were no additional repurchases of our common stock during 2016. 

As of December 31, 2016, our investments comprise 78.2 percent of our total assets. We currently manage and plan to continue to manage our portfolio, allocate capital and budget our investments on a holistic basis and not in separate segments. Our cash comprised 20.7 percent of our total assets and other assets comprised the remaining 1.1 percent of our total assets. As of December 31, 2016, we did not have debt outstanding.
Co-Investment Opportunities

During 2016, we began to provide accredited investors in the Company with the opportunity to co-invest in certain of our portfolio companies through one or more series issued by H&H Co-Investment Partners, LLC. The Company serves as the managing member of and investment adviser to H&H Co-Investment Partners. We anticipate earning management and incentive fees in connection with our management of certain series issued by H&H Co-Investment Partners. As of December 31, 2016, H&H Co-Investment Partners did not have any capital under management.
Investments that Generate Current Income

As a BDC, we invest in and offer managerial assistance to our investee companies. In certain cases, particularly in ones where we control the company, we may receive consulting fees for our time and services. During 2016, we generated short-term income through payment of such consulting fees from seven of the 23 active privately held and publicly traded companies in our portfolio in which we own at least one class of equity securities (approximately 30 percent). The majority of the income generated from fees for providing managerial assistance to portfolio companies during 2016 was from Interome, Inc. We expect that our income generated from such investments will decrease during 2017 owing to the transition of management of Interome from that of personnel employed by us to personnel employed by Interome beginning in the second quarter of 2017. We currently expect income generated in 2017 and beyond to be primarily from fees from managing capital in co-investment and other potential funds as well as from dividends and interest on invested capital in publicly traded and privately held portfolio companies.

Historically, we demonstrated the ability to identify, diligence, underwrite and realize gains in mid- to late-stage companies and securities that produce current income to us. We may refer to our activities in this area as specialty finance, and it is a part of our ability to invest opportunistically in a range of securities to take advantage of market inefficiencies. We identified such an opportunity in providing debt capital to mid- to late-stage companies that have capital needs that are in excess of most online lending platforms and marketplaces or are below the thresholds that interest traditional lenders. We continue to believe there is a lack of capital available to companies that fit this profile and an opportunity for us to generate favorable risk-adjusted returns on invested capital through investments in these companies.

We believe we have two primary competitive advantages for investments in such companies and securities: 1) Our long history of investing in companies throughout their life cycles provides us with extensive knowledge and experience in understanding the needs and risks of investing in such companies; and 2) We are able to design creative investment options and solutions for investee companies.
Involvement in Our Investee Companies

As a BDC, we invest in and offer managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. We may own 100 percent of the securities of a small business for a period of time. We may control the company for a substantial period. We may control 25 percent or more of the board seats in those companies in which we have significant ownership. We expect to maintain or increase our control in our controlled and partner investee companies over time. These businesses tend to lack management depth, to have limited or no history of operations and to not have attained profitability. Because of the speculative nature of these investments, these securities have a significantly greater risk of loss than traditional investment securities. Some of our investee companies will never realize their potential, and some will be unprofitable or result in complete loss of our investment. Some of our investee companies will build successful companies but will not provide a return to us. Small businesses are more vulnerable to adverse business or economic developments than better-capitalized companies. Small businesses generally have limited product lines, markets and/or financial resources. Publicly traded small businesses and those with small market capitalizations are not well known to the investing public and are generally subject to high volatility, to general movements in markets, to perceptions of potential growth and/or the potential for bankruptcy.

In connection with our investments, we provide a variety of services, including the following:

• | serving in management roles;


• | recruiting management;


• | formulating operating strategies;


• | formulating intellectual property strategies;


• | assisting in financial planning;


• | providing management in the initial start-up stages;


• | introducing corporate and development partners; and


• | establishing corporate goals.

We may assist in raising additional capital for these companies from other potential investors. We are more likely to invest our own capital rather than seek capital from other investors in our controlled and partner companies. This reliance on our capital to fund the operations of these companies increases the risks associated with such investments. We typically find it necessary or appropriate to provide additional capital of our own in rounds of financing subsequent to our initial investment. We may introduce these companies to potential joint venture partners, suppliers and customers. In addition, we may assist in establishing relationships with investment bankers and other professionals. We may also assist management of our investee companies with strategy and execution of merger and acquisition ("M&A") transactions. We generate income from certain of our controlled and partner companies for these services and plan to increase this source of short-term income in the future.

We may control, be represented on, or have observer rights on the board of directors of a portfolio company through one or more of our officers or directors who may also serve as officers of the portfolio company. We indemnify our officers and directors for serving on the boards of directors or as officers of portfolio companies, which exposes us to additional risks. 
Industry Sectors of Investment

We currently classify our existing investments in one of three industry sectors: Life Sciences, Energy and Electronics. Historically, the interdisciplinary nature of science-based inventions enabled our portfolio companies to address needs in multiple sectors rather than being confined to addressing needs in one sector.

We classify companies in our life sciences portfolio as those that address problems in life sciences-related industries, including biotechnology, agriculture, advanced materials and chemicals, diagnostics, health care, bioprocessing, water, industrial biotechnology, food, and nutrition. Our investments in precision health and precision medicine companies fall into this category.

We classify companies in our energy portfolio as those that seek to improve performance, productivity or efficiency, and to reduce environmental impact, waste, cost, energy consumption or raw materials. Energy is a term used commonly to describe products and processes that solve global problems related to resource constraints. The term "cleantech" is also used commonly in a similar manner.

We classify companies in our electronics portfolio as those that address problems in electronics-related industries, including semiconductors, computing, telecommunications and data communications, metrology and test and measurement.
Investment Securities and Strategies

Neither our investments, nor an investment in us, is intended to constitute a balanced investment program. We expect to be risk seeking rather than risk averse in our investment approach. To such end, we reserve the fullest possible freedom of action, subject to our Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws, applicable law and regulations, and policy statements contained herein. There is no assurance that our investment objectives will be achieved.

5

We have discretion in the investment of our capital to achieve our objectives. Historically, we invested a substantial portion of our assets in securities that we consider to be private equity investments. These private equity investments usually do not pay interest or dividends and typically are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale that may adversely affect the liquidity and marketability of such securities. Some of our convertible bridge notes may result in payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest, which typically accrues over the life of the bridge note and often converts into equity of the portfolio company upon a financing event. 
While we plan to continue to make investments in securities of existing privately held and publicly traded portfolio companies, we plan to focus future new investments on what we believe are deeply undervalued, small publicly traded companies where we believe we can positively impact the business and valuation through constructive activism. These businesses can range in stage from pre-revenue to generating positive cash flow. 
Substantially all of our privately held investments are in thinly capitalized, unproven, small companies focused on commercializing risky technologies. We do not currently limit our investments to any categories of investments. Our securities investments may consist of private, public or governmental issuers of any type, subject to the restrictions imposed on us as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Subject to the diversification requirements applicable to a RIC, we may commit all of our assets to only a few investments.

Our investment approach is comprised of a patient examination of available opportunities thorough due diligence and close involvement with management of our portfolio companies. We currently invest our capital directly into portfolio companies or through purchases of publicly traded companies in open-market purchases. We may in the future seek to invest our capital alongside capital from other investors through co-investment funds that we control. Such funds could provide benefits to us including 1) the generation of income from management fees; 2) the potential to participate economically in the returns of the funds invested above and beyond the returns generated from investment of our capital; 3) the ability for us to increase the amount of capital under our control invested per portfolio company; and 4) in cases where we may partner with others, we gain access to market intelligence and distribution and manufacturing expertise that complements our expertise in identifying disruptive innovations and building companies.

Subject to continuing to meet the compliance tests applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act, there are no limitations on the types of securities or other assets in which we may invest. Investments may include the following:

• | Equity, equity-related securities (including warrants and options) and debt with equity features from either private or public issuers;


• | Debt obligations of all types having varying terms with respect to security or credit support, subordination, purchase price, interest payments and maturity;


• | Foreign securities;


• | Intellectual property or patents or research and development in technology or product development that may lead to patents or other marketable technology; and


• | Miscellaneous investments.

The following is a summary description of the types of assets in which we may invest, the investment strategies we may use, and the attendant risks associated with our investments and strategies.

Equity, Equity-Related Securities and Debt with Equity Features

We may invest in equity, equity-related securities and debt with equity features. These securities include common stock or units, preferred stock or units, debt instruments convertible into common or preferred stock or units, limited partnership interests, other beneficial ownership interests and warrants, options or other rights to acquire or agreements to sell any of the foregoing.

We primarily make such investments in companies with operating histories that are unprofitable or marginally profitable, that have negative net worth, or that are involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings. These investments would involve businesses that management believes have potential for rapid growth through the infusion of additional capital and management assistance. In addition, we may make investments in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of companies or divisions of 
6

companies. There is a significantly greater risk of loss with these types of securities than is the case with traditional investment securities.

Warrants, options and convertible or exchangeable securities generally give the investor the right to acquire specified equity securities of an issuer at a specified price during a specified period or on a specified date. Warrants and options fluctuate in value in relation to the value of the underlying security and the remaining life of the warrant or option, while convertible or exchangeable securities fluctuate in value both in relation to the intrinsic value of the security without the conversion or exchange feature and in relation to the value of the conversion or exchange feature, which is like a warrant or option. When we invest in these securities, we incur the risk that the option feature will expire worthless, thereby either eliminating or diminishing the value of our investment.

Most of our current portfolio company investments are in the equity securities of private companies. Investments in equity securities of private companies often involve securities that are restricted as to sale and cannot be sold in the open market without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or pursuant to a specific exemption from these registrations. Opportunities for sale are more limited than in the case of marketable securities, although these private investments may be purchased at more advantageous prices and may offer attractive investment opportunities. Even if one of our portfolio companies completes an initial public offering ("IPO"), we are typically subject to a lock-up agreement for 180 days or longer, and the stock price may decline substantially before we are free to sell or enter into contracts to sell these shares. These lock-up restrictions apply to us and our shares of the portfolio company owned prior to the IPO and may include shares purchased by us in an IPO. These restrictions generally include provisions that stipulate that we are not permitted to offer, pledge or sell our shares, including selling covered call options on our shares, prior to the expiration of the lock-up period. We are also prohibited from entering into new securities lending arrangements for these securities during the lock-up period. We may also own securities of privately held companies that complete public listings through reverse mergers into publicly traded shell companies. Our shares of the privately held company prior to the reverse merger may be subject to additional restrictions on their sale under Rule 144.

We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in market conditions, currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions.
We may also invest in publicly traded securities of whatever nature, including relatively small, emerging growth companies that management believes have long-term growth potential. These investments may be through open-market transactions or through private placements in publicly traded companies ("PIPEs"). Securities purchased in PIPE transactions are typically subject to a lock-up agreement for 180 days or longer, or are issued as unregistered securities that are not freely tradable for at least six months.

Even if we have registration rights to make our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies more marketable, a considerable amount of time may elapse between a decision to sell or register the securities for sale and the time when we are able to sell the securities. The prices obtainable upon sale may be adversely affected by market conditions, by the level of average trading volume of the underlying stock as compared with the position offered for sale or negative conditions affecting the issuer during the intervening time. We may elect to hold formerly restricted securities after they have become freely marketable, either because they remain relatively illiquid or because we believe that they may appreciate in value. During this holding period, the value of these securities may decline and be especially volatile. If we need funds for investment or working capital purposes, we might need to sell marketable securities at disadvantageous times or prices.

Debt Investments
We may hold debt securities, including in privately held and thinly traded public companies, for income and as a reserve pending more speculative investments. Debt obligations may include U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, receivables or other asset-based financing, notes, bonds, debentures, or other debt obligations of any nature and repurchase agreements related to these securities. These obligations may have varying terms with respect to security or credit support, subordination, purchase price, interest payment and length of time to maturity from private, public or governmental issuers of any type located anywhere in the world. We may invest in debt obligations of companies with operating histories that are unprofitable or marginally profitable, that have negative net worth or are involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings, or that are start-up or development-stage small businesses. In addition, we may participate in the acquisition or divestiture of companies or divisions of companies through issuance or receipt of debt obligations. As of December 31, 2016, the debt obligations held in our portfolio consisted of convertible bridge notes and senior secured debt. Our convertible bridge notes generally do not 
7

generate cash payments to us, nor are they held for that purpose. Our convertible bridge notes and the interest accrued thereon are generally held for the purpose of potential conversion into equity at a future date.

Our investments in debt obligations may be of varying quality, including non-rated, unsecured and highly speculative debt investments with limited marketability. Investments in lower-rated and non-rated securities, commonly referred to as "junk bonds," including our non-convertible debt investments, are subject to special risks, including a greater risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest. Generally, lower-rated and non-rated securities offer a higher return potential than higher-rated securities, but involve greater volatility of price and greater risk of loss of income and principal, including the possibility of default or bankruptcy of the issuers of these securities. Lower-rated securities and comparable non-rated securities will likely have large uncertainties or major risk exposure to adverse economic conditions and are predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. In addition, issuers of lower-rated securities and comparable non-rated securities are often highly leveraged and may not have more traditional methods of financing available to them; therefore, their ability to service their debt obligations during an economic downturn or during sustained periods of rising interest rates may be impaired. The risk of loss owing to default by these issuers is significantly greater because lower-rated securities and comparable non-rated securities generally are unsecured and frequently are subordinated to the prior payment of senior indebtedness. We may incur additional expenses to the extent that we are required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of principal or interest on our portfolio holdings. In addition, many of the companies in which we invest have limited cash flows and no income, which may limit our ability to recover in the event of a default.

The markets in which lower-rated securities or comparable non-rated securities are traded generally are more limited than those in which higher-rated securities are traded. The existence of limited markets for these securities may restrict our ability to obtain accurate market quotations for the purposes of valuing lower-rated or non-rated securities and calculating net asset value or to sell securities at their fair value. The market values of lower-rated and non-rated securities also tend to be more sensitive to individual corporate developments and changes in economic conditions than higher-rated securities. The occurrence of adverse conditions and uncertainties to issuers of lower-rated securities would likely reduce the value of lower-rated or non-rated securities held by us, with a commensurate effect on the value of our shares, when applicable.

The market values of investments in debt securities that carry no equity conversion rights usually reflect yields generally available on securities of similar quality and type at the time purchased. When interest rates decline, the market value of a debt portfolio already invested at higher yields can be expected to rise if the securities are protected against early call. Similarly, when interest rates increase, the market value of a debt portfolio already invested at lower yields can be expected to decline. Deterioration in credit quality also generally causes a decline in market value of the security, while an improvement in credit quality generally leads to increased value.
Foreign Securities

We may make investments in securities of issuers whose principal operations are conducted outside the United States, and whose earnings and securities are stated in foreign currency. In order to comply with restrictions owing to our status as a BDC, our investments in non-qualifying assets, including the securities of companies organized outside the United States, would be limited to 30 percent of our assets, because under the 1940 Act, we must generally invest at least 70 percent of our assets in "qualifying assets," which exclude securities of foreign companies.

In comparison with otherwise comparable investments in securities of U.S. issuers, currency exchange risk of securities of foreign issuers is a significant variable. The value of these investments to us will vary with the relation of the currency in which they are denominated to the U.S. dollar, as well as with intrinsic elements of value such as credit risk, interest rates and performance of the issuer. Investments in foreign securities also involve risks relating to economic and political developments, including nationalization, expropriation of assets, currency exchange freezes and local recession. Securities of many foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than those of comparable U.S. issuers. In addition, accounting and financial reporting standards that prevail outside of the U.S. generally may differ from U.S. standards and, consequently, less information is typically available concerning companies located outside of the U.S. than for those located in the U.S. Interest and dividend income and capital gains on our foreign securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes that may not be recoverable by us. We may seek to hedge all or part of the currency risk of our investments in foreign securities through the use of futures, options and forward currency purchases or sales.
8

Intellectual Property

We believe there is a role for organizations that can assist in technology transfer. Scientists and institutions that develop and patent intellectual property perceive the need for and rewards of entrepreneurial commercialization of their inventions.

Our form of investment may be:

• | funding research and development in the development of a technology;


• | obtaining licensing rights to intellectual property or patents;


• | acquiring intellectual property or patents; or


• | forming and funding companies or joint ventures to commercialize further intellectual property.

Income from our investments in intellectual property or its development may take the form of participation in licensing or royalty income, fee income, or some other form of remuneration. In order to satisfy RIC requirements, these investments may be held in an entity taxable as a corporation. Investment in developmental intellectual property rights involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of our entire investment as well as additional risks, including uncertainties as to the valuation of an investment and potential difficulty in liquidating an investment. Further, investments in intellectual property generally require investor patience, as investment return may be realized only after or over a long period. At some point during the commercialization of a technology, our investment may be transformed into ownership of securities of a small business, as discussed above.
Importance of Availability of Liquid Capital

Privately held equity investment funds are structured commonly as limited partnerships with a committed level of capital and finite lifetime. Capital is "called" from limited partners to make investments and pay for expenses of running the fund at various points within its lifetime. For each initial investment, the fund must reserve additional capital for follow-on investments at later stages of the life of the portfolio companies. These follow-on investments are required because often portfolio companies in areas in which we invest, whether privately held or publicly traded, operate with negative cash flow for periods of time. In general, the cumulative total of initial invested capital and reserves cannot exceed the committed level of capital of the fund.

Our strategy for investing capital is similar to this approach in some respects. We make initial investments in privately held and publicly traded companies and project the amount of capital that may be required should the company mature successfully. These projections, equivalent to the reserves of privately held equity-focused investment funds, are reviewed weekly by management, are updated frequently and are a component of the data that guide our decisions on whether to make new and/or follow-on investments. As a publicly traded, internally managed investment company, our cash used to make investments and pay expenses is held by us and not called from external sources when needed. 
Borrowing and Margin Transactions

We may from time to time borrow money or obtain credit by any lawful means from banks, lending institutions, other entities or individuals, in negotiated transactions. We may issue, publicly or privately, bonds, debentures or notes, in series or otherwise, with interest rates and other terms and provisions, including conversion rights, on a secured or unsecured basis, for any purpose, up to the maximum amounts and percentages permitted for BDCs under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act currently prohibits us from borrowing any money or issuing any other senior securities (including preferred stock but excluding temporary borrowings of up to five percent of our assets), if after giving effect to the borrowing or issuance, the value of our total assets less liabilities not constituting senior securities would be less than 200 percent of our senior securities. We may pledge assets to secure any borrowings. 

On September 30, 2013, the Company entered into a $20,000,000 Multi-Draw Term Loan Facility Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, as borrower, Orix Corporate Capital, Inc., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto from time to time, which provided a multi-draw credit facility (the "Loan Facility") that could be used by us to fund investments in portfolio companies. We pledged our assets to secure any borrowings. The draw period for the Loan Facility ended on September 30, 2016. On December 1, 2016, we paid off all outstanding obligations associated with the Loan Facility and the Loan Facility was no longer in effect as of that date. The funds used to pay off the obligations were from the sale of Metabolon, Inc., during the fourth quarter that generated a gain on invested capital. As of December 31, 2016, we did not have outstanding debt.

 Portfolio Company Turnover

Changes with respect to portfolio companies will be made as our management considers necessary in seeking to achieve our investment objectives. The rate of portfolio turnover will not be treated as a limiting or relevant factor considered by management when making portfolio changes.

Although we expect that many of our investments will be relatively long term in nature, we may make changes in our particular portfolio holdings whenever it is considered that an investment no longer has substantial growth potential or has reached its anticipated level of performance, or (especially when cash is not otherwise available) that another investment appears to have a relatively greater opportunity for capital appreciation. We may also make general portfolio changes to increase our cash and position ourselves in a defensive posture. We may make portfolio changes without regard to the length of time we have held an investment, or whether a sale results in profit or loss, or whether a purchase results in the reacquisition of an investment that we may have only recently sold. Our investments in privately held small businesses are illiquid, which limits portfolio turnover. The portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly during a year as well as from year to year and may also be affected by cash requirements.

We currently expect that our portfolio company turnover will increase from historical rates as we make more investments in securities of publicly traded companies.
Management

Achievement of our investment objective as of December 31, 2016, was primarily dependent upon the judgment of Douglas W. Jamison and Daniel B. Wolfe, full-time members of management. Blake Stevens, Senior Associate, and Alexei Andreev, a part-time employee who is a Venture Partner, were also involved in the management of our investment portfolio. 
We currently expect that shortly following the scheduled Special Meeting of shareholders on March 24, 2017, Douglas W. Jamison, our current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will resign from all of his positions with the Company to become Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HALE.life Corporation, a portfolio holding of the Company. Simultaneous with Mr. Jamison’s resignation, the Board intends to appoint Kevin M. Rendino, who currently serves as a director on our Board, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

There can be no assurance that a suitable replacement could be found for any of our officers upon their retirement, resignation, inability to act on our behalf, or death.

Competition

Numerous companies and individuals are engaged in investing in privately held or small publicly traded businesses, and such businesses are intensely competitive. We believe our corporate structure permits public market investors to participate in investing in privately held or small publicly traded businesses, company building, specialty finance leveraging access to due diligence, constructive activism and other resources that may not be readily accessible to public market investors. We also believe our corporate structure permits greater liquidity and better transparency than private investment funds and private equity businesses. We believe we are a unique company with our focus on being actively involved investors in small capitalization publicly traded companies and privately held companies as a liquid, U.S. exchange-listed, publicly traded company.

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and are, therefore, in certain respects, in a better position than we are to obtain access to attractive investment opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete against these businesses for attractive investments, particularly in capital-intensive companies.
Regulation

The Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980 amended the 1940 Act to establish the regulatory framework for BDCs. BDCs are a special type of investment company. After a company files its election to be treated as a BDC, it may not withdraw its election without first obtaining the approval of holders of a majority of its outstanding voting securities. The following is a brief description of the 1940 Act provisions applicable to BDCs, qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 1940 Act and the rules issued thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

10

Generally, to be eligible to elect BDC status, a company must primarily engage in the business of furnishing capital and making significant managerial assistance available to companies that do not have ready access to capital through conventional financial channels such as private companies and small public companies. The companies that satisfy certain additional criteria described below are termed "eligible portfolio companies." In general, in order to qualify as a BDC, a company must: (i) be a domestic company; (ii) have registered a class of its securities pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"); (iii) operate for the purpose of investing in the securities of certain types of portfolio companies, including early-stage or emerging companies and businesses suffering or just recovering from financial distress (see following paragraph); (iv) make available significant managerial assistance to such portfolio companies; and (v) file a proper notice of election with the SEC.

An eligible portfolio company generally is a domestic company that is not an investment company or a company excluded from investment company status pursuant to exclusions for certain types of financial companies (such as brokerage firms, banks, insurance companies and investment banking firms) and that: (i) has a fully diluted market capitalization of less than $250 million and has a class of equity securities listed on a national securities exchange, (ii) does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, or (iii) is controlled by the BDC by itself or together with others (control under the 1940 Act is presumed to exist where a person owns at least 25 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company) and has a representative on the board of directors of such company.

As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of the directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our shareholders arising from willful malfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office. We may be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act and federal securities laws.

The 1940 Act provides that as a BDC, we may not make an investment in non-qualifying assets unless at the time at least 70 percent of the value of our total assets (measured as of the date of our most recently filed financial statements) consists of qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include: (i) securities of eligible portfolio companies; (ii) securities of certain companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time we initially acquired their securities and in which we retain a substantial interest; (iii) securities of certain controlled companies; (iv) securities of certain bankrupt, insolvent or distressed companies; (v) securities received in exchange for or distributed in or with respect to any of the foregoing; and (vi) cash items, U.S. government and agency securities and high quality short-term debt. The SEC has adopted a rule permitting a BDC to invest its cash in certain money market funds. The 1940 Act also places restrictions on the nature of the transactions in which securities can be purchased in some instances in order for the securities to be considered qualifying assets.

We are permitted by the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and a single class of preferred stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200 percent after the issuance of the debt or the preferred stock (i.e., such senior securities may not be in excess of our net assets). Under specific conditions, we are also permitted by the 1940 Act to issue warrants.

Except under certain conditions, we may sell our securities at a price that is below the prevailing net asset value per share only during the 12-month period after (i) a majority of our directors and our disinterested directors have determined that such sale would be in the best interest of us and our shareholders and (ii) the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and the holders of a majority of our voting securities held by persons who are not affiliated persons of ours approve our ability to make such issuances. A majority of the disinterested directors must determine in good faith that the price of the securities being sold is not less than a price which closely approximates the market value of the securities, less any distribution discount or commission.

Certain transactions involving certain closely related persons of the Company, including its directors, officers and employees, may require the prior approval of the SEC. However, the 1940 Act ordinarily does not restrict transactions between us and our portfolio companies.

We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code's requirements.

Tax Status

The following discussion is a general summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to our qualification and taxation as a RIC and the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our preferred stock or common stock, but does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations relating thereto. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, financial institutions, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S. expatriates, U.S. persons with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, persons that hold our preferred stock or common stock as part of an integrated investment (including a "straddle"), "controlled foreign corporations," "passive foreign investment companies," or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax. This summary is limited to beneficial owners of our preferred stock or common stock that will hold our preferred stock or common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, temporary and final U.S. Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding our preferred stock or common stock. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets.

This summary does not discuss the consequences of an investment in our subscription rights, debt securities or warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our preferred stock, common stock or debt securities or as units comprised of combinations of securities. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of such an investment will be discussed in the relevant prospectus supplement. In addition, we may issue preferred stock with terms resulting in U.S. federal income taxation of beneficial owners with respect to such preferred stock in a manner different from that set forth in this summary. In such instances, such differences will be discussed in a relevant prospectus supplement.

If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our preferred stock or common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Investors treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors that are partners in such a partnership) are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisers with respect to the tax consequences relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our preferred stock or common stock.

Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences to an investor in our securities will depend on the facts of their particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisers regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in tax laws.
Election to be Taxed as a RIC

Effective on January 1, 1997, we met the criteria specified below to qualify as a RIC and elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code with the filing of our federal income tax return for 1997. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate taxes on any income we distribute to our shareholders as dividends, which allows us to reduce or eliminate our corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
Taxation as a RIC

For any taxable year in which we:

• | qualify as a RIC; and


• | distribute at least 90 percent of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any (the "Annual Distribution Requirement").

12

We generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain ( i.e., net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses) that we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to shareholders with respect to that year. We made an election to recognize built-in gains as of the effective date of our election to be treated as a RIC and, therefore, will not be subject to built-in gains tax when we sell those assets. However, if we subsequently acquire built-in gain assets from a C corporation in a carryover basis transaction, then we may be subject to tax on the gains recognized by us on dispositions of such assets unless we make a special election to pay corporate-level tax on such built-in gain at the time the assets are acquired. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders.

In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain the tax benefits of RIC status, in addition to satisfying the Annual Distribution Requirement, we must, among other things:


• | have in effect at all times during each taxable year an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90 percent of our gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities and (b) net income derived from an interest in a "qualified publicly traded partnership" (the "90 Percent Income Test"); and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:


◦ | at least 50 percent of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5 percent of the value of our assets or more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and


◦ | no more than 25 percent of the value of our assets is invested in (i) securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of one issuer, (ii) securities of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) securities of one or more "qualified publicly traded partnerships" (the "Diversification Tests").

As noted above, in order to qualify as a RIC, we must satisfy the Diversification Tests each quarter. Because of the specialized nature of our investment portfolio, in some years we have been able to satisfy the diversification requirements under Subchapter M of the Code primarily as a result of receiving certification from the SEC under the Code with respect to each taxable year beginning after 1998 that we were "principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available" for such year.

Although we received SEC certifications for 1999 to 2015, there can be no assurance that we will receive such certification for subsequent years (to the extent we need additional certifications as a result of changes in our portfolio). If we require, but fail to obtain, the SEC certification for a taxable year, we may fail to qualify as a RIC for such year. We also will fail to qualify for favorable RIC tax treatment for a taxable year if we do not satisfy the 90 Percent Income Test, Diversification Tests or Annual Distribution Requirement for such year. In the event we do not satisfy the 90 Percent Income Test, the Diversification Tests or the Annual Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, we will be subject to federal tax with respect to all of our taxable income, whether or not distributed. In addition, all our distributions to shareholders in that situation generally will be taxable as ordinary dividends.

Although we currently intend to qualify as a RIC for each taxable year, under certain circumstances, we may choose to take action with respect to one or more taxable years to ensure that we would be taxed under Subchapter C of the Code (rather than Subchapter M) for such year or years. Additionally, income from fees for providing managerial assistance to portfolio companies generally does not qualify as good RIC income under the 90 Percent Income Test. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated more income from such fees and failed to qualify as a RIC for the 2016 tax year owing to its inability to satisfy the 90 Percent Income Test. The Company is, therefore, obligated to be taxed under Subchapter C of the Code (subject to federal, state and local income tax) on its taxable income, if any. Although the Company failed the 90 Percent Income Test for 2016, it does not have taxable income and is in a loss position owing to gains being offset by capital and net operating losses during the current year.  The Company will continue to evaluate the long-term impact of potential taxation as a C-Corporation based on tax liabilities resulting from failure to pass the 90 Percent Income Test, the Diversification Tests or the Annual Distribution Requirement in each subsequent year.
13

Our ownership percentages in our portfolio have increased over the last several years, which make it more difficult to pass certain RIC Diversification Tests when companies in our portfolio are successful and we wish to invest additional capital in those companies to increase our investment returns. As long as the aggregate values of our non-qualifying assets remain below 50 percent of total assets, we will pass the Diversification Tests. Rather than selling portfolio companies that are performing well in order to pass the RIC Diversification Tests, we may opt instead not to qualify as a RIC and to be taxed as a C-Corporation. We will choose to take such action only if we believe that the result of the action will benefit us and our shareholders.
Under applicable Treasury regulations and certain private rulings issued by the IRS, RICs are permitted to treat certain distributions payable in up to 80 percent in their stock as taxable dividends, which will satisfy their annual distribution obligations for federal income tax and excise tax purposes provided that shareholders have the opportunity to elect to receive the distribution in cash. Taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly designated as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, then such sales may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. We may in the future determine to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our common stock.

As a RIC, we will be subject to a 4 percent non-deductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 percent of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2 percent of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax (the "Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement"). We will not be subject to excise taxes on amounts on which we are required to pay corporate income tax (such as retained net capital gains). Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry over taxable income in excess of current year distributions from such taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4 percent excise tax on such income, as required. The maximum amount of excess taxable income that may be carried over for distribution in the next year under the Code is the total amount of dividends paid in the following year, subject to certain declaration and payment guidelines. To the extent we choose to carry over taxable income into the next tax year, dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income, the distribution of prior year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current year, or returns of capital.

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.

Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as a capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.

We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement (collectively, the "Distribution Requirements"). However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain "asset coverage" tests are met. We may be restricted from making distributions under the terms of our debt obligations themselves unless certain conditions are satisfied. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the Distribution Requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio, or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Distribution Requirements, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level federal income tax.

14

Any transactions in options, futures contracts, constructive sales, hedging, straddle, conversion or similar transactions, and forward contracts will be subject to special tax rules, the effect of which may be to accelerate income to us, defer losses, cause adjustments to the holding periods of our investments, convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains, convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses or have other tax consequences. These rules could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to shareholders. We do not currently intend to engage in these types of transactions.

Although we have not done so historically, if we invest in certain real estate investment trusts or residual interests of real estate mortgage investment conduits, a portion of our income may be classified as "excess inclusion income." Investors that are not otherwise subject to tax may be taxable on their share of any such excess inclusion income as unrelated business taxable income ("UBTI"). In addition, tax may be imposed on us on the portion of any excess inclusion income allocable to any investors that are classified as disqualified organizations.

A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its "investment company taxable income" (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income (e.g., as the result of large amounts of equity-based compensation), we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years and such net operating losses do not pass through to the RIC's shareholders. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC may not use any net capital losses (that is, realized capital losses in excess of realized capital gains) to offset the RIC's investment company taxable income, but may carry forward such losses and can use certain of them to offset capital gains indefinitely. Losses incurred prior to the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 carry an expiration date and must be used prior to post-enactment losses. As a result of this ordering rule, pre-enactment loss carryforwards may be more likely to expire unused. Owing to these limits on the deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our shareholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions.

Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty are often as high as 35 percent or more. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on this related income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not presently known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as paid by its shareholders.

If we acquire stock in certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75 percent of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, rents, royalties or capital gain) or hold at least 50 percent of their total assets in investments producing such passive income ("passive foreign investment companies"), we could be subject to federal income tax. We could also be subject to additional interest charges on "excess distributions" received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income or gain actually received by us is timely distributed to our shareholders. We would not be able to pass through to our shareholders any credit or deduction for such a tax. Certain elections may, if available, ameliorate these adverse tax consequences, but any such election requires us to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in passive foreign investment companies to minimize our tax liability. Foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving non-dollar debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our shareholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of "qualifying income" from which a RIC must derive at least 90 percent of its annual gross income.

Taxation of U.S. Shareholders

A "U.S. shareholder" generally is a beneficial owner of shares of our preferred stock or common stock who is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
15


• | a citizen or individual resident of the United States including an alien individual who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States or meets the "substantial presence" test under Section 7701(b) of the Code;


• | a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;


• | a trust if (1) a court in the United States has primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons has the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or (2) if such trust validly elects to be treated as a U.S. person for federal income tax purposes; or


• | an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

For federal income tax purposes, distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. shareholders as ordinary income or capital gains. Distributions of our "investment company taxable income" (which is, generally, our ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. shareholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional preferred stock or common stock. To the extent such distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. shareholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations, such distributions may be reported by us as "qualified dividend income" eligible to be taxed in the hands of non-corporate shareholders at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met at both the shareholder and company levels. In this regard, it is anticipated that distributions paid by us generally will not be attributable to dividends and, therefore, generally will not be qualified dividend income. Distributions of our net capital gains (which is generally our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) properly reported by us as "capital gain dividends" will be taxable to a U.S. shareholder as long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 20 percent, in the case of individuals, trusts or estates), regardless of the U.S. shareholder's holding period for his, her or its preferred stock or common stock and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional preferred stock or common stock. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. shareholder's adjusted tax basis in such shareholder's preferred stock or common stock and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gains to such U.S. shareholder.

We currently intend to retain some or all of our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses, but to designate the retained net capital gain as a "deemed distribution." In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. shareholder will be required to include his, her or its share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the U.S. shareholder, and the U.S. shareholder will be entitled to claim a tax credit equal to his, her or its allocable share of the tax paid thereon by us. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained net capital gains at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by non-corporate shareholders on long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that non-corporate shareholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. shareholder's other federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds a shareholder's liability for federal income tax. A shareholder that is not subject to federal income tax or otherwise required to file a federal income tax return would be required to file a federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. For federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of shares owned by a U.S. shareholder will be increased by an amount equal under current law to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the U.S. shareholder's gross income and the tax deemed paid by the U.S. shareholder as described in this paragraph. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our shareholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a "deemed distribution."

For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any year and (2) the amount of the deduction for ordinary income and capital gain dividends paid for that year, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following taxable year as if it had been paid during the taxable year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. shareholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the taxable year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. shareholders on December 31 of the year in which the dividend was declared.

If an investor purchases shares of our preferred stock or common stock shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the shares will include the value of the distribution and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though economically it may represent a return of his, her or its investment.

A U.S. shareholder generally will recognize a taxable gain or loss if the U.S. shareholder sells or otherwise disposes of his, her or its shares of our preferred stock or common stock. Any gain arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. shareholder has held his, her or its shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it will be classified as a short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of shares of our preferred stock or common stock held for six months or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of shares of our preferred stock or common stock may be disallowed if other shares of our common stock are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition. In such a case, the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.

In general, individual U.S. shareholders currently are subject to a reduced maximum federal income tax rate of 20 percent on their net capital gain (i.e., the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year) including any long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income currently payable by individuals. In addition, individuals with income in excess of $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married individuals filing jointly) and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional 3.8 percent tax on their "net investment income," which generally includes net income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents, and net capital gains (other than certain amounts earned from trades or businesses). Corporate U.S. shareholders currently are subject to federal income tax on net capital gain at the maximum 35 percent rate also applied to ordinary income. Non-corporate U.S. shareholders with net capital losses for a year (i.e., capital losses in excess of capital gains) generally may deduct up to $3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each year; any net capital losses of a non-corporate shareholder in excess of $3,000 generally may be carried forward and used in subsequent years as provided in the Code. Corporate U.S. shareholders generally may not deduct any net capital losses for a year, but may carry back such losses for three years or carry forward such losses for five years.

We (or the applicable withholding agent) will send to each of our U.S. shareholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a notice reporting the amounts includible in such U.S. shareholder's taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the federal tax status of each year's distributions generally will be reported to the IRS (including the amount of dividends, if any, eligible for the 20 percent "qualified dividend income" rate). Distributions may also be subject to additional state, local, and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. shareholder's particular situation. Dividends distributed by us generally will not be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction or the preferential rate applicable to "qualified dividend income."

In some taxable years, we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax ("AMT"). If we have tax items that are treated differently for AMT purposes than for regular tax purposes, we may apportion those items between us and our shareholders, and this may affect our shareholder's AMT liabilities. Although regulations explaining the precise method of apportionment have not yet been issued by the IRS, we may apportion these items in the same proportion that dividends paid to each shareholder bear to our taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction), unless we determine that a different method for a particular item is warranted under the circumstances. You should consult your own tax adviser to determine how an investment in our stock could affect your AMT liability.

We may be required to withhold federal income tax ("backup withholding") from all distributions to any non-corporate U.S. shareholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such shareholder is exempt from backup withholding, or (2) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such shareholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual's taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number. Any amount withheld under backup withholding is allowed as a credit against the U.S. shareholder's federal income tax liability, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS.

Generally, an exempt organization is exempt from U.S. federal income tax on its passive investment income, such as dividends, interest and capital gains. This general exemption from tax does not apply to the UBTI of an exempt organization. Generally, income and gain derived by an exempt organization from the ownership and sale of debt-financed property is UBTI and, thus, taxable in the proportion to which such property is financed by "acquisition indebtedness" during the relevant period of time. Tax-exempt U.S. investors will not incur UBTI as a result of our leveraged investment activities, although a tax-exempt investor may incur UBTI on dividend income paid by us and generally on any gain realized on the sale of shares of our common stock, if it borrows to acquire such shares. Tax-exempt U.S. investors may be subject to UBTI on excess inclusion income allocated to such investors as a result of an investment by us (if any) in certain certain real estate investment trusts or residual interests of real estate mortgage investment conduits. Tax-exempt U.S. persons are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in our shares.

Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders

A "Non-U.S. shareholder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our preferred stock or common stock that is not a U.S. shareholder or a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Whether an investment in our shares is appropriate for a Non-U.S. shareholder will depend upon that person's particular circumstances. An investment in the shares by a Non-U.S. shareholder may have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisers before investing in our preferred stock or common stock.

In general, dividend distributions (other than certain distributions derived from net long-term capital gains) paid by us to a Non-U.S. shareholder are subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or lower applicable treaty rate) even if they are funded by income or gains (such as portfolio interest, short-term capital gains, or foreign-source dividend and interest income) that, if paid to a Non-U.S. shareholder directly, would not be subject to withholding. If the distributions are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. shareholder (and, if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. shareholder in the United States), we will not be required to withhold federal income tax if the Non-U.S. shareholder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements, although the distributions will be subject to federal income tax at the rates applicable to U.S. shareholders. (Special certification requirements apply to a Non-U.S. shareholder that is a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, and such entities are urged to consult their own tax advisers.)

However, no withholding is required with respect to certain distributions if (i) the distributions are properly reported as "interest-related dividends" or "short-term capital gain dividends" in written statements to our shareholders, (ii) the distributions are derived from sources specified in the Code for such dividends and (iii) certain other requirements are satisfied. Currently, we do not anticipate that any significant amount of our distributions would be reported as eligible for this exemption from withholding.

Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gains to a Non-U.S. shareholder, and gains realized by a Non-U.S. shareholder upon the sale of our preferred stock or common stock, will not be subject to federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to federal income tax unless the distributions or gains, as the case may be, are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. shareholder (and, if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. shareholder in the United States), or in the case of an individual shareholder, the shareholder is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the sale or capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met.

If we distribute our net capital gains in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions, a Non-U.S. shareholder will be entitled to a federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the shareholder's allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gains deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. shareholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. shareholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a federal income tax return. For a corporate Non-U.S. shareholder, distributions (both actual and deemed), and gains realized upon the sale of our preferred stock or common stock that are effectively connected to a U.S. trade or business may, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30 percent rate (or at a lower rate if provided for by an applicable treaty). Accordingly, investment in the shares may not be appropriate for a Non-U.S. shareholder.

A Non-U.S. shareholder who is a non-resident alien individual, and who is otherwise subject to withholding of federal income tax, may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of federal income tax on dividends unless the Non-U.S. shareholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or an acceptable substitute or successor form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a Non-U.S. shareholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.

Legislation commonly referred to as the "Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act," or "FATCA," generally imposes a 30 percent withholding tax on payments of certain types of income to foreign financial institutions that fail to enter into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to report certain required information with respect to accounts held by U.S. persons (or held by foreign entities that have U.S. persons as substantial owners). The types of income subject to the tax include U.S. source interest and dividends, and the gross proceeds from the sale of any property that could produce U.S. source interest or dividends paid after December 31, 2016. The information required to be reported includes the identity and taxpayer identification number of each account holder that is a U.S. person and transaction activity within the holder's account. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, this legislation also imposes a 30 percent withholding on payments to foreign entities that are not financial institutions unless the foreign entity certifies that it does not have a greater than 10 percent U.S. owner or provides the withholding agent with identifying information on each greater than 10 percent U.S. owner. Depending on the status of Non-U.S. holders and the status of the 
18

intermediaries through which they hold their shares, Non-U.S. holders could be subject to this 30 percent withholding tax with respect to distributions on their shares and proceeds from the sale of their shares. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.

Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the U.S. federal income tax and withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in the shares.
Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company

If we fail to satisfy the 90 Percent Income Test, the Diversification Tests and the Annual Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets).

If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to shareholders, nor would they be required to be made. Such distributions would be taxable to our shareholders and provided certain holding period and other requirements were met, could qualify for treatment as "qualified dividend income" eligible for the 20 percent maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder's tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
