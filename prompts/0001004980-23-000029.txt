This 2022 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of the significant risks that could affect the outcome of these forward-looking statements and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Forward-Looking Statements” above. 
Triple Bottom Line
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s purpose is to deliver for their hometowns, serve the planet, and lead with love. In support of this purpose, the companies employ a Lean operating model designed to drive more effective and responsive decision-making, reduce the difficulties many coworkers face in their day-to-day work, and deliver better outcomes for customers and communities.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the “triple bottom line” of people, planet, and prosperity, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value they create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line is designed to balance the interests of the companies’ many stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of the companies’ activities. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to consider the impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and prosperity in their daily operations as well as in their long-term strategic decisions. The Utility will continue to seek fair and timely regulatory treatment in order to support its customer-driven investment plan while pursuing cost-control measures that would allow it to maintain the affordability of its service. The Lean operating system is an important means of realizing PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s objective of achieving world class performance while delivering hometown service.
People
The people element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to their workforce, their customers, the residents of local communities in which the companies do business, and other stakeholders. 
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s goal is to continually reduce risk to keep customers, the communities they serve, and their workforce (both employees and contractors) safe. Their focus is on continuously building an organization where every work activity is designed to facilitate safe performance, every worker knows and practices safe behaviors, and every individual is encouraged to speak up and stop work if they see unsafe or risky behavior, and has confidence that their concerns and ideas will be heard and pursued. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to significantly improving their safety performance by understanding their risks, prioritizing their work, using controls to reduce risks, and continuously measuring and improving risk reduction. 
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s human capital resource objectives are to build and retain an engaged, well trained, diverse, and equitably-paid workforce. PG&E Corporation and the Utility place a high priority on delivering customer value and providing a hometown customer experience. The Utility’s customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety, increasing electric and gas reliability, and improving customer satisfaction. 
For more information, see “Human Capital” below.
Planet
The planet element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to protect and serve the environment. This commitment extends beyond compliance with various state and federal environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that integrating and managing climate change and other environmental considerations in the companies’ business strategies creates long-term value for PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and for their customers, communities, coworkers, and other stakeholders. Mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change presents opportunities for growth for the Utility’s business and economic opportunity for the communities it serves. 
The Utility strives to be prepared to continue to deliver safe, clean, affordable, and reliable energy in the face of increasingly severe and extreme climate-driven natural hazards. To build resilience to these hazards, the Utility is working to systematically integrate the consideration of forward-looking climate data and tools in its decision-making. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also work with policymakers and regulators to advance effective climate adaptation policy in California, and work directly with local governments and communities on adaptation solutions.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility have committed to helping heal the planet. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Climate Strategy Report, which is available to the public, describes the companies’ climate goals and plans to meet those goals. To meet their longer-term climate goals, PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to scale their efforts to decarbonize the electric system to accommodate a shift to vehicle electrification, integrate a proliferation of distributed energy resources, and achieve increased penetration of renewable energy combined with investments in the grid and energy storage. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility also plan to transition the gas system to cleaner fuels, increasingly target natural gas delivery for hard-to-electrify customer sectors, and support efforts to accelerate building electrification. The objective is to do so in an orderly manner to achieve a positive customer and community experience, while reducing natural gas system investments in targeted electrified communities.
The impacts of climate change on the Utility’s infrastructure are already a reality. Record-breaking extreme heat and heat waves are increasingly a regular occurrence throughout California. Peak electric loads are expected to increase with increasing temperatures due to direct impacts of ambient temperatures on equipment and direct impacts on electricity demand driven by rising air conditioning installation and usage, and increasingly driven in the future from widespread progress in adoption of beneficial electrification technologies. The Utility’s assets on the coast and in or near watersheds face potential increased exposures to coastal, riverine, and precipitation-related flooding because of climate-driven changes in precipitation and sea-level rise.
Climate change will also continue to intensify the potential for wildfires throughout California. The worsening conditions across California increase the likelihood and severity of wildfires, including those where the Utility’s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire’s ignition. Reducing risk will be even more important as climate change continues to exacerbate the risks facing the Utility. A key element of preparing the Utility for the physical risks of climate change is an updated and more detailed system-wide CVA of the Utility’s assets, operations, and services, which the Utility expects to file with the CPUC in 2024. The CVA is expected to improve the Utility’s understanding of its exposure to climate hazards and the sensitivity of assets and operations to these hazards.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to pursue policies and programs that enable safe, reliable, and affordable clean and resilient energy for their customers. As a result of actions already taken by PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the companies have:
•Delivered clean electricity to customers in 2022 that was more than 95% GHG free.
•Helped customers avoid emissions and energy costs through robust energy efficiency programs. 
•Awarded contracts for more than 3.3 GWs of battery energy storage to be deployed over the next several years, strengthening California’s grid efficiency and reliability. 
•Installed approximately 340 charging ports for electric vehicles at schools, parks, public charging locations, and in support of fleets - with nearly half in disadvantaged communities - and received regulatory approval for new innovative pilots on vehicle grid integration, submetering, and dynamic rates.
•Brought the total number of interconnected private solar customers to more than 700,000 and supported more than 50,000 customers who have installed battery storage at their homes or businesses.
•Continued to advance decarbonization initiatives for the Utility’s natural gas delivery system, including meeting the CPUC-mandated methane emission reduction target ahead of schedule and accelerating initiatives to meet its voluntary 2030 reduction goal.
The CPUC coordinates the planning of supply resources through the Integrated Resource Planning (“IRP”) proceeding and has determined that replacing the power generated by Diablo Canyon is the responsibility of all LSEs within the CAISO. Looking ahead, the Utility expects its GHG-free energy supply mix of renewable, large hydroelectric, and nuclear generation resources to decrease as, beginning in 2023, the Utility is required to offer for allocation or sale renewables portfolio standard-eligible (“RPS”) attributes that the Utility procured on behalf of customers that subsequently switched to non-Utility providers in order to comply with regulatory mandates and to manage customer affordability. Towards the end of the decade and beyond, the Utility’s GHG-free energy supply mix is expected to grow relative to 2025 levels as the Utility procures new GHG-free generation and storage to meet California’s IRP GHG emissions reduction targets and California’s clean energy goals. For more information, see “Electric Integrated Resource Planning and Related Procurement” below.
Prosperity
The prosperity element of the triple bottom line represents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s commitment to meeting their financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities they serve. Management believes clean energy should be affordable for and inclusive of all economic backgrounds. 
Under cost-of-service ratemaking, a utility’s earnings depend on the outcomes of its ratemaking proceedings and its ability to manage costs.
See “Ratemaking Mechanisms” below and “Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. MD&A for more information on specific CPUC and FERC proceedings.
Generally, differences between forecast costs and actual costs (discussed in “Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings” in Results of Operations in Item 7. MD&A) can occur for numerous reasons, including the volume of work required and the impact of market forces on the cost of labor and materials. Differences in costs can also arise from changes in laws and regulations at both the state and federal level. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to taking steps to improve their credit ratings and metrics over time, including by reducing their debt. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have set goals to reduce their debt over time, including reducing PG&E Corporation’s debt by at least $2 billion by the end of 2026. PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that reducing the consolidated debt will help them achieve investment grade credit ratings for their unsecured securities, for the benefit of both customers and investors. For more information, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Pursuant to SB 901, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to recover $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs, which was approved by the CPUC on February 28, 2022. PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds on May 10, 2022 and $3.9 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds on July 20, 2022. The net proceeds from both transactions were used to reimburse the Utility for previously incurred recovery costs, including the retirement of $5.0 billion of Utility debt and the repayment of a portion of the loans outstanding under the Utility's revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. The Utility intends to use a portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the redemption of $1.0 billion of Utility debt. For more information, see “Application for Post-Emergence Securitization Transaction” in Item 7. MD&A.
On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s common stock, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to issue dividends is subject to restrictions. On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock. On June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility also reinstated the dividend on the Utility’s common stock. For more information, see “Dividends” in Item 7. MD&A.
Total capital expenditures (including accruals) recorded in 2022 were $9.6 billion. The Utility’s total capital expenditures (including accruals) are forecasted to be between $7.9 billion and $11.2 billion for 2023, between $7.9 billion and $12.2 billion for 2024, between $8.0 billion and $12.7 billion for 2025, between $8.1 billion and $13.3 billion for 2026, and between $8.1 billion and $13.8 billion for 2027. The completion of projects, the timing of expenditures, and the associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials, financing, legal and regulatory approvals and developments, community requests or protests, weather, and other unforeseen conditions. 
The Utility expects to make additional capital expenditures, the recovery of which will be subject to future regulatory approval, including the 2023 GRC. These expenditures include capital expenditures exceeding amounts authorized in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S, and expenditures to be included in a later stage of the 2023 GRC or separate applications. These expenditures are expected to primarily be for wildfire mitigation, transportation electrification, and the Lakeside Building. Additionally, $3.21 billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditures will be excluded from the Utility’s equity rate base pursuant to AB 1054. 
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are committed to keeping gas and electric services affordable for all customers. The Utility’s capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. Certain CPUC proceedings could impact different types of customers differently. Similarly, although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as “pass-through” costs, commodity prices rose substantially in 2022, relative to 2021. The Utility has set a goal to increase customer capital investments while also limiting customer impacts, including by reducing non-fuel Operating and maintenance costs by two percent per year and by seeking efficient financing. The Utility plans to meet its two percent non-fuel Operating and maintenance cost reduction goal through increased efficiency, including waste elimination through the Lean operating system. The Utility has a number of programs in place to assist low-income customers, such as the CARE program. Under the CARE program, income-qualified customers can receive a monthly discount of 20% or more on their gas and electric bill. 
PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Corporate Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes the companies’ progress toward world-class performance measured with the triple bottom line framework.
In 2021, the Utility spent $4.01 billion with certified diverse suppliers, representing 38.7% of its total spend.
