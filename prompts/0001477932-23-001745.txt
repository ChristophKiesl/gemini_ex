The ESG Clean Energy System is designed to, among other things, generate clean electricity from internal combustion engines and utilize waste heat to capture approximately 100% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from the engine without loss of efficiency, and in a manner to facilitate the production of certain commodities. Patent No. 11,286,832, for example, covers the invention of an “exhaust-gas-to-exhaust-gas heat exchanger” that efficiently cools - and then reheats - exhaust from a primary power generator so greater energy output can be achieved by a secondary power source with safe ventilation. Another key aspect of this patent is the development of a carbon dioxide capture system that utilizes the waste heat of the carbon dioxide pump to heat and regenerate the adsorber that enables carbon dioxide to be safely contained and packaged.

The Company intends to sell, lease and/or sub-license the ESG Clean Energy System to third parties using, among other things, Simson-Maxwell’s existing distribution channels. The Company may also utilize the ESG Clean Energy System for its own account, whether in connection with its petroleum operations, Simson-Maxwell’s power generation operations, or otherwise.

Medical Waste Disposal System Using Ozone Technology

In January 2022, the Company acquired a 51% interest in Viking Ozone Technology, LLC (“Viking Ozone”), which owns the intellectual property rights to a patented  (i.e., US Utility Patent No. 11,565,289), proprietary medical and biohazard waste treatment system using ozone technology. Simson-Maxwell has been designated the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and vendor of this system. The technology is designed to be a sustainable alternative to incineration, chemical, autoclave and heat treatment of bio-hazardous waste, and for the treated waste to be classified as renewable fuel for waste-to-energy (“WTE”) facilities in many locations around the world. 
Open Conductor Detection Technologies

In February 2022, the Company acquired a 51% interest in two entities, Viking Sentinel Technology, LLC (“Viking Sentinel”) and Viking Protection Systems, LLC (“Viking Protection”), that own the intellectual property rights to patent pending (i.e., US Applications 16/974,086, 17/672,422 and 17/693,504), proprietary electric transmission and distribution open conductor detection systems. The systems are designed to detect a break in a transmission line, distribution line, or coupling failure, and to immediately terminate the power to the line before it reaches the ground. The technology is intended to increase public safety and reduce the risk of causing an incendiary event, and to be an integral component within grid hardening and stability initiatives by electric utilities to improve the resiliency and reliability of existing infrastructure.
Oil & Gas Properties

Existing Assets

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Mid-Con Petroleum, LLC and Mid-Con Drilling, LLC (collectively, the “Mid-Con Entities”), owns working interests in oil fields in Kansas, which include a combination of producing wells, non-producing wells and water injection wells. 

Divestitures in 2022

On July 8, 2022, four of the wholly owned subsidiaries of Petrodome Energy, LLC (“Petrodome”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Viking, entered into Purchase and Sale Agreements to sell all of their interests in the oil and gas assets owned by those Petrodome subsidiaries, including in the aggregate, interests in 8 producing wells, 8 shut-in wells, 2 salt water disposal wells and 1 inactive well, to third parties for $3,590,000 in cash. The proceeds from the sale were used to fully repay Petrodome’s indebtedness to CrossFirst Bank under the June 13, 2018 revolving line of credit loan. 

This transaction resulted in the disposition of most of the Company’s total oil and gas reserves (see Note 6 to the Company’s financial statements). The Company recorded a loss on the transaction in the amount of $8,961,705, as follows:


Proceeds from sale | $ | 3,590,000 | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------+--
Reduction in oil & gas full cost pool (based on % of reserves disposed) | | (12,791,680 | )
ARO recovered | | 239,975 | 
Loss on disposal | $ | (8,961,705 | )

Additionally, in July 2022, the Company received an unanticipated refund of a $1,200,000 performance bond as a result of Petrodome ceasing to operate certain assets in the State of Louisiana. The gain from this refund has been included in the “loss on disposal of membership interests and assets” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Divestitures in 2021

On October 5, 2021, the Company disposed of all of membership interests of Ichor Energy Holdings, LLC (“Ichor”). The third-party purchaser assumed all of the rights and obligations associated with such membership interests, including the debt and derivatives associated with Ichor and/or its subsidiaries. The Company originally acquired the assets owned by Ichor on December 28, 2018, which at the time included interests in approximately 58 producing wells and approximately 31 saltwater disposal wells in Texas and Louisiana. 

On October 12, 2021, the Company disposed of all of the membership interests of Elysium Energy Holdings, LLC (“Elysium”).

The Company originally acquired the assets owned by Elysium on February 3, 2020, which included interests in approximately 127 wells, along with associated equipment in Texas and Louisiana.

Potential Merger with Camber Energy, Inc.

On February 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Camber Energy, Inc. (“Camber”), the majority owner of the Company’s common stock. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Camber (“Merger Sub”) will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly- owned subsidiary of Camber.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share: (i) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Viking Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares owned by Camber, the Company and Merger Sub, will be converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of Camber; and (ii) of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the “Viking Preferred Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of Camber (the “Camber Series A Preferred Stock”). Each share of Camber Series A Preferred Stock will convert into 890 shares of common stock of Camber (subject to a beneficial ownership limitation preventing conversion into Camber common stock if the holder would be deemed to beneficially own more than 9.99% of Camber’s common stock), will be treated equally with Camber’s common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation, and will only have voting rights with respect to voting: (a) on a proposal to increase or reduce Camber’s share capital; (b) on a resolution to approve the terms of a buy-back agreement; (c) on a proposal to wind up Camber; (d) on a proposal for the disposal of all or substantially all of Camber’s property, business and undertaking; (f) during the winding-up of Camber; and/or (g) with respect to a proposed merger or consolidation in which Camber is a party or a subsidiary of Camber is a party. Holders of Viking Common Stock and Viking Preferred Stock will have any fractional shares of Camber common stock or preferred stock after the Merger rounded up to the nearest whole share.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company equity award, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration in respect of each share of Viking Common Stock underlying such equity award and, in the case of Company stock options, be converted into vested Camber stock options based on the merger exchange ratio calculated as provided above (the “Exchange Ratio”).

The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that effective as of the Effective Time, James A. Doris, the current Chief Executive Officer of both the Company and Camber, shall serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the resulting merged entity (the “Combined Company”) following the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement provides that, as of the Effective Time, the Combined Company will have its headquarters in Houston, Texas.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Camber and Company will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, to provide non-public information to third parties and to engage in discussions with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to customary exceptions. The Company is required to hold a meeting of its stockholders to vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that its stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Camber is required to hold a meeting of its stockholders to approve the issuance of Viking Common Stock and Viking Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Share Issuance”).

The completion of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by Camber’s stockholders and approval of the Share Issuance by Camber’s stockholders, (ii) receipt of required regulatory approvals, (iii) effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 for the Camber common stock to be issued in the Merger (the “Form S-4”), and (iv) the absence of any law, order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the Merger or making the completion of the Merger illegal. Each party’s obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (i) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, performance by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and (iii) the absence of any material adverse effect on the other party, as defined in the Merger Agreement.

Additional closing conditions to the Merger include that in the event the NYSE American determines that the Merger constitutes, or will constitute, a “back-door listing” / “reverse merger”, Camber (and its common stock) is required to qualify for initial listing on the NYSE American, pursuant to the applicable guidance and requirements of the NYSE as of the Effective Time. 

The Merger Agreement can be terminated (i) at any time with the mutual consent of the parties; (ii) by either Camber or Company if any governmental consent or approval required for closing is not obtained, or any governmental entity issues a final non-appealable order or similar decree preventing the Merger; (iii) by either Company or Camber if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before August 1, 2021; (iv) by Camber or Company, upon the breach by the other of a term of the Merger, which is not cured within 30 days of the date of written notice thereof by the other; (v) by Camber if Company is unable to obtain the affirmative vote of its stockholders for approval of the Merger; (vi) by Company if Camber is unable to obtain the affirmative vote of its stockholders required pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement; and (vii) by Company or Camber if there is a willful breach of the Merger Agreement by the other party thereto. The Merger Agreement contains customary obligations of the parties and representations and warranties.

As of March 24, 2023, neither the Company nor Camber has advised of its intention to terminate the Merger Agreement. However, given the lapse of time since the date of the Merger Agreement, the Company believes it is reasonably likely that certain terms would need to be modified by the parties in order for the parties to proceed with the Merger. 

On or about March 14, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors resolved to enter into negotiations with Camber to modify certain terms of the Merger and to re-engage a valuation firm in connection with securing a fairness opinion or any other valuation report, analyses or presentations that might be necessary or appropriate regarding the Merger. As of March 24, 2023, the Company had not determined the revised terms upon which it would be prepared to proceed with the Merger. Any modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement would be subject to the written agreement of both the Company and Camber, and there is no assurance that the Company and Camber will agree on any such proposed modifications. Moreover, the satisfaction of conditions, whether existing or new, may be outside of the Company’s control.
