  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Overview
  
   We are a leader in the emerging market for intelligent roadway systems developed to take advantage of recent developments in artificial intelligence ("AI"). We have developed advanced vehicle recognition systems that can extract more accurate and complete data from existing cameras and sensors. Our systems have also been designed to take full advantage of the latest technological advances in new cameras and sensors, edge processing and cloud computing.  We have also developed platforms that enable the data our systems collect to be analyzed in combination with other sources and distributed to multiple end users in real time as actionable intelligence or data collected for long range planning purposes in full compliance with the security and privacy requirements of each end user.
  
 These capabilities are particularly useful to governmental entities and businesses in solving a wide variety of real-world vehicle-related operational challenges. Our ability to enhance the results provided by existing Internet Protocol (“IP”) connected cameras has enabled significant new uses for vehicle recognition technology that were not previously available or cost effective. We currently provide products and services for governmental organizations and large and small businesses throughout the world. Customers currently use our products or services in approximately 80 countries in applications that include public safety, transportation, parking, security, customer experience, operational efficiency and logistics.
  
 On March 29, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved changing the Company’s name to Rekor Systems, Inc.
  
 Previously, we provided professional services and staffing solutions to the government contracting and the aerospace and aviation industries through our Professional Services Segment. The Professional Services Segment included our wholly owned subsidiaries AOC Key Solutions Inc. (“AOC Key Solutions”), Global Technical Services, Inc. (“GTS” or “TeamGlobal”), Firestorm Solutions, LLC (Firestorm Solutions”) and Firestorm Franchising, LLC (“Firestorm Franchising” and, together with Firestorm Solutions, “Firestorm”). As part of the development of a new line of products for the public safety and security markets, we determined that our resources were best concentrated on vehicle recognition products and services and began to consider dispositions in our Professional Services Segment. Concurrently, we reorganized and retooled our product development, business development and administrative resources to better serve our Technology Segment. On April 2, 2020, we sold AOC Key Solutions. As of June 29, 2020, we sold TeamGlobal and determined that all the remaining operations that comprised our Professional Services Segment met the criteria to be presented as discontinued.
  
 Our continuing operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary, Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. (“Rekor Recognition”). In connection with the development of several new public safety products, we acquired substantially all the assets of OpenALPR Technology, Inc. in March 2019. This acquisition (the “OpenALPR Technology Acquisition”) transferred vehicle recognition software and associated licenses and proprietary rights to OpenALPR Software Solutions, LLC (“OpenALPR”), a new wholly owned subsidiary of Rekor Recognition. OpenALPR’s vehicle recognition platform, already operating on approximately 6,800 cameras in approximately 80 countries worldwide that cover approximately 14,000 lanes of roadway, has laid the groundwork for expansion, enabling multiple deployment mechanisms for our products and services. Since the Open ALPR Technology Acquisition, our engineering teams have worked continuously to expand and refine the Open ALPR platform. In October 2020, we announced the launch of Rekor One™, an advanced platform that serves as a unifying source of roadway intelligence for multiple government agencies across cities, counties and states. The Rekor One™ platform supports multiple community safety, intelligent roadway and revenue generation activities that can benefit from the use of our advanced vehicle recognition software.
  
 Rekor’s mission is to enable “AI driven decisions” by enhancing the capabilities in the governmental and commercial sectors with actionable, real-time insights. We seek to deliver these insights through an expanding software portfolio that not only addresses the challenges our customers are currently facing but empowers them to effectively deal with their evolving needs.

 Our core vehicle recognition software currently has the capability to analyze multi-spectral images and video streams produced by nearly any IP camera and concurrently extract license plate data by state or province from approximately 80 countries, together with to the vehicle’s make, model, color, body type and direction of travel. Our software is designed to process video streams on the edge of the network prior to posting results to the Cloud, so that users are immediately provided usable real-time information for mission critical public safety and commercial applications. When combined with speed-optimized code, parallel processing capability and best-in-class hardware accessories, such as cameras and communications modules, the software captures license plate data and vehicle characteristics at extremely high vehicle speeds with a high degree of accuracy, even in unusually difficult conditions, such as low lighting, poor weather, extreme camera viewing angles, and obstructions.
  
 Rekor One provides governments with a comprehensive vehicle intelligence system that supports multiple agency-specific missions. With Rekor One, governments can unify and flexibly expand their existing IP camera networks, while transforming them into a safe and smart multi-dimensional roadway network. Since it can interface with multiple database and operating systems, Rekor One’s industry leading features allow users to observe security and privacy protocols that are customized to the needs and requirements of each end-user department or agency, facilitating high level compliance with the latest advances in privacy and information security requirements. Rekor One is designed to permit the cost of a network to be fractionalized based on relative value to multiple end users. Each participating agency receives a unique user interface and dashboard, which draws on Rekor One’s unified vehicle recognition intelligence to provide data customized to the agency’s specific needs. This can eliminate redundant systems and single function applications to increase efficiency and lower costs.
  
 Prior to the development of our proprietary vehicle identification software, we believe that highly accurate results were not available using a typical IP camera. With the ability to generate more accurate results with less expensive hardware, we believe the dynamics of existing roadway and public safety markets are changing, enabling the creation of increasingly robust networks at less cost. In addition, we expect our improvements in cost and accuracy to create competitive advantages in tolling systems and logistics operations that currently rely on more expensive and complex radio frequency identification (“RFID”) systems. We also expect our lower costs, superior camera reading distance and field of view capabilities, along with the ability to capture additional vehicle information, such as direction, color, make model and body type of vehicle, to open opportunities in other market segments. These opportunities include parking operations, quick service restaurants, school safety, retail customer loyalty programs and, particularly, smart cities and smart roadways. Smart roadway systems, sometimes referred to as smart mobility systems, smart transport or intelligent transport systems (“ITS”), inclusive of parking management and guidance, passenger information and traffic management systems, can optimize the movement of vehicles to make travel safer and more efficient. These technologies are expected to enable users to be more coordinated, better informed and better able to manage transport networks efficiently. 
  
  Business Strategy
  
 Since 2019, we have been focusing on developing and marketing products and services with vehicle recognition features powered by our AI based technology. In connection with our shift in resources to focus on our technology offerings, we completed the final steps of our announced change in strategic direction in 2020. In the second quarter, we disposed of and discontinued all operations in our Professional Services Segment. Accordingly, for our fiscal years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of the subsidiaries that were previously presented as part of the Professional Services Segment have been classified as discontinued operations and not presented as part of continuing operations.
  
 With the disposition of all our professional services operations, we have concentrated on developing our footprint across different industries that can make use of our advances in vehicle recognition. We have focused both on improving our product and service offerings and our ability to penetrate the markets for these products and services. Current customers are using these products and services for: a) toll collection and traffic analysis in the transportation market, b) school and traffic safety and other law enforcement applications in the public safety market, c) parking management, d) perimeter management and surveillance in the private security market and e) vehicle tracking, perimeter security and warehouse operations in the logistics market. Our efforts to further penetrate these markets have included strategic partnership with major market participants, the establishment of reseller programs for smaller businesses and the implementation of an eCommerce platform that supports frictionless direct sales to customers via the Internet.

 Since the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition, we have developed a broad range of vehicle recognition product and service lines, starting with public safety, parking operations and toll collection and expanding into criminal justice information sharing, roadway compliance program operations, auto wash and service, quick service restaurants and drive-in retail. We shifted from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription-based model, refined and rebranded our software to highlight products such as Rekor Scout™ and Rekor CarCheck™ and released several packaged hardware products with preloaded versions of our vehicle recognition engine. We have also launched a robust eCommerce portal on the OpenALPR.com site, enabling customers to conveniently purchase Rekor Scout and Rekor CarCheck with just a credit card and a click. This allows owners to immediately enhance their business operations while reducing the operating cost for Rekor.
  
  The ability of our technology to bring enhanced capabilities to existing hardware systems, as well as the inclusion of cross-program interfaces that allow real-time data analysis from a variety of sources, has also created new opportunities for the use of vehicle recognition systems. Our recently announced Rekor OneTM platform and Rekor GoTM app have been designed to support these new uses by taking full advantage of the latest advances in data processing and digital communications. As described below, these efforts are already producing promising results in connection with our retention by the State of Oklahoma in its program to identify uninsured motor vehicles, our pilot program with the North Dakota state parks system and our selection by MasterCard as a partner in its AI Powered Drive Through Platform. We expect to continue to find new opportunities to provide unified, multi-mission support for governmental programs and to integrate our products and services into quick service drive through operations and retail customer loyalty programs.

In the third quarter of 2020, we each made an initial cash contribution of $75,000. Roker will be designed to automate parking enforcement and enable higher revenue recovery for both public safety institutions and private businesses alike. In January 2021 we made another $75,000 cash contribution in Roker. Our ownership percentage did not change as a result of this additional contribution.


   ●
 The spread of the COVID-19 virus around the world has caused significant volatility in U.S. and international markets. In response to COVID-19, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act, among other things, includes the Payroll Protection Program which provides forgivable loans to qualified small businesses, primarily to allow these businesses to continue to pay their employees. We received $874,000 as a result of the Payroll Protection Program. There continues to be significant uncertainty about the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. and international economies and, as such, we are unable to determine at this time the full impact it will have impact to our operations.


   ●
 In March 2020, we increased our authorized shares of common stock from 30,000,000 to 100,000,000. The increase in authorized shares was done in order to permit us to raise capital or issue our common stock for other business purposes.


   ●
 We have also been active in arranging licensing agreements and strategic partnerships. In 2020, SecurePark Technologies, a leading parking solutions company, selected our iP360 Parking and Permit Management software as a simple, reliable, and affordable solution for their global clients and Digifort, a global leader in video surveillance and monitoring, headquartered in Brazil with more than 28,000 customers in 130 countries, became a premier reseller for Watchman software in Brazil, Latin America, the Pacific Rim and the Middle East.

  Vehicle Recognition Technology
  
 A key capability of our core software is its ability to provide precision vehicle identification results with dramatically less expensive hardware, including its ability to be used with existing IP cameras and computer equipment. The software can also support lighter and smaller equipment that is more adaptable for use in mobile applications. This can change the economics and dynamics of an existing market, eliminating the need for more expensive RFID technology on toll roads, for example, or allowing smart city programs to incorporate vehicle recognition capabilities into their operations without replacing existing camera infrastructure. Thus, our core software has enabled us to develop products and service that address three traditional governmental concerns: safety, infrastructure, and revenue generation. In addition, our lower cost structure supports new applications of vehicle recognition capabilities, such as supporting retailers’ customer loyalty programs and facilitating user-controlled parking management, in combination with ingress and egress control, for small homeowner’s associations.
  
 Most of the products and services we have developed are designed to exploit the unique capabilities of our core vehicle recognition software. Where competing systems have concentrated on identifying license plates, Rekor’s software is able to identify the make, type and color of a vehicle and its direction of travel, among other characteristics. These characteristics can be combined with other data and used to develop estimates of vehicle weight and emissions and provide alerts that are useful in traffic management, roadway design and maintenance and environmental assessments.
  
  Government Agency Products and Services
  
 Rekor’s product offerings for the government agency market include public safety, toll road, program compliance and parking products and services. Our public safety products include subscriptions for or purchases of an advanced line of camera systems that seamlessly captures and processes vehicle data. The cameras are housed in a sleek, durable enclosure that can be easily mounted to a building or pole and include software specially designed for the Rekor ScoutTM Platform, which identifies and captures red light and school safety zone traffic violations, provides forensic quality images and data and supports citation management services. The Rekor ScoutTM Platform provides accurate license plate and vehicle recognition on nearly any IP, traffic, or security camera and can be subscribed to separately for use with existing camera or sensor systems. Rekor ScoutTM displays results on a web-based dashboard that can be accessed from anywhere by any authorized user. The platform connects to the National Crime Information Center (“NCIC”) lists and permits the agency to establish customized hotlists with alerts, apply customized data retention policies and share data with other agencies. Rekor’s law enforcement products and services also include speed trailer and other mobile vehicle recognition devices, including Rekor Blue, a vehicle recognition smartphone application for law enforcement customers, that is projected to be released during 2021.
  
 With the launch of our Rekor One™ platform, Rekor can now provide government agencies with a comprehensive vehicle intelligence system that supports multiple agency-specific missions. Rekor One™ allows our customers to create a unified system of sensors that simultaneously provides segmented roadway intelligence to a variety of agencies. With Rekor One™, an agency will be able to integrate their existing IP and traffic cameras into a smart multi-dimensional roadway network that can support long-range planning as well as provide quicker responses to dangerous situations. With user dashboards customized per department, each agency can access the information they need while maintaining full compliance with their individual security and privacy requirements. With six patents pending in conjunction with the development of Rekor One™, we are working to provide government agencies with significant improvements in the usability as well as the quality of vehicle recognition data. The patents cover areas that include privacy enhancements, data analytics, smarter image processing, advanced vehicle identification techniques, and the improved aesthetics of roadside equipment.
  
  AutoNotice™ is a cloud-based financial management application. AutoNotice™ provides a plate-based management account system that offers our customers a multi-tiered database that can assist with most record management operations. AutoNotice™ also provides application programming interface for third-party payment gateways for credit card transactions to accommodate both phone and web payments. AutoNotice™ can automatically record payments in the system and provide functionality to research, manage unapplied payments and reconcile receipts.
  
 Most recently, our Rekor One™ platform was selected by the State of Oklahoma to provide vehicle information associated with uninsured motorists as part of the state’s UVED Program. Use of the Rekor One platform by Oklahoma’s UVED Program will help further the state’s mission to decrease the number of uninsured motorists on the road and keep matters out of the court systems. Rekor is committed to further these goals and facilitating the obtainment of fair insurance for motorists through timely notices and a streamlined process. We anticipate Oklahoma’s program and the integration of the Rekor One technology will inspire additional states to follow Oklahoma’s model to develop similar programs.

 Another rapidly developing area that we expect to participate in is the implementation of “smart city” transportation management systems, including congestion pricing programs. In May of 2019, Rekor was selected by Nokia to provide vehicle recognition solutions for deployment within its Scene IoT analytics platform. This platform has been designed to analyze video from interconnected camera networks and detect anomalies that can be used by public agencies. We will be looking for opportunities to participate in the development of smart city systems in association with Nokia in other key participants in this burgeoning area.
  
  Commercial Products and Services
  
 Customized versions of Rekor Scout are also offered for the commercial market. The commercial versions of Rekor Scout include enabled specialized offerings for the parking, retail and community security markets. Products and services for the commercial market also include Rekor CarCheck. Rekor CarCheck provides an API that supports nearly any programming language, analyzes still images of vehicles from approximately 80 countries and responds in seconds with license plate data, as well as vehicle make, body type, and color. Rekor Go is an app available for iOS and Android devices that can instantly read license plates and receive alerts when identified vehicles appear on user generated lists. With a simple live video scan, anyone from a parking lot attendant to a school crossing guard can harness powerful license plate recognition and identify vehicles of interest in real-time using a smart phone.
  
 In December 2020, we launched Rekor Go™, an application which brings the power of our license plate recognition technology to mobile devices. We believe the app, available on both iOS and Android, is the first on-device license plate recognition app that captures data while the user is still or moving, operating in real-time using the device’s live video stream. Captured plates are instantly compared to a user-generated list, shortening the time from capture to insight. If an approved or unapproved plate is detected, the app issues a real-time audible and physical alert. Rekor Go allows the user to manage alerts, review images of all reads, and export data that can be downloaded and shared. Rekor Go’s companion website also allows the user to create and upload bulk lists. A significant differentiator from other cloud-based license plate recognition apps is that Rekor Go does not need to be continuously connected and can be used in areas where Wi-Fi and cellular service is limited or unreliable. By accessing accurate and effortless license plate recognition on a smartphone, individuals and businesses can increase productivity and revenue and automate tasks in areas such as visitor management, parking operations (commercial and residential), campus and event security and asset location and recovery.
  
 At the end of 2020, we had a portfolio of ten software subscription services available on the eCommerce platform and the new Rekor Go app, available for download in the App Store and on Google Play. This set of product offerings allows us to offer full-scale vehicle recognition solutions and services directly to public agencies and commercial or industrial businesses of nearly any size, as well as serve campus and residential settings.
  
 Our Markets
  
  The markets for our products and services are diverse: toll collection and traffic management; parking management and enforcement; safe and smart cities and roadways programs; statewide vehicle compliance programs; government, military, corporate, community and personal security; wholesale and large retail logistics and customer loyalty programs, as well as public safety.
  
 During the early stages of our business development, our efforts were concentrated primarily on public safety, security and surveillance, and parking management opportunities. We continue to grow our footprint in public safety, with the addition of major law enforcement customers in Lauderhill, Florida, Mt. Juliet, Tennessee and Collierville, Tennessee, while increasingly expanding our reach into non-traditional vehicle recognition areas such as statewide vehicle compliance, roadway intelligence, and customer loyalty. Recently, our Rekor One™ platform was selected by the State of Oklahoma to provide vehicle information associated with uninsured motorists as part of the state’s UVED Program. Use of the Rekor One platform by Oklahoma’s UVED Program will help further the state’s mission to decrease the number of uninsured motorists on the road and keep matters out of the court system. Rekor is committed to further these goals and is helping motorists obtain of fair insurance through timely notices and a streamlined process.

 We anticipate Oklahoma’s program and the integration of the Rekor One technology will inspire additional states to follow Oklahoma’s model to develop similar programs. In Oklahoma and other states, opportunities exist to use the Rekor One platform well beyond insurance compliance, for a comprehensive roadway intelligence system that benefits multiple agencies within a state, including departments of transportation, public works, and law enforcement. By combining compliance modules with service modules, Rekor One provides both the technology for roadway monitoring as well as a source of revenue to fund the programs. Our vision is to provide a single network of sensors that achieve multiple missions, saving taxpayer dollars while making roadways safer and more efficient, and allow for future expansion as our AI software technology evolves.
  
 Another rapidly developing area that we expect to participate in is the implementation of customer loyalty programs along with drive-through and curbside service for retail establishments. Our primary customer in this endeavor is MasterCard, who is seeking to expand its reach into quick service restaurants with AI-driven menu boards. Rekor provides the vehicle recognition component, which is synchronized with the menu board and customer loyalty program. MasterCard’s first pilot program customer is White Castle, where we installed our systems and software at a restaurant in Indiana. Additional pilot locations are planned for 2021, and we anticipate optimizing our software so that it can be utilized in a variety of retail applications. We believe that with COVID-19, there will be a permanent alteration in the habits of retail customers, who are now comfortable with contactless options, whether they are dining, shopping, or getting groceries. Our AI products and services are designed and prepared to support this market expansion.
  
  Clients
  
  Our clients in these markets include federal, state and local government entities worldwide, major retailers, private security companies, parking management companies, fast-food restaurant chains and logistics companies. We continue to explore new applications to further expand this growing client base.
 Sales and Marketing
  
 We offer our products and services in various markets through a combination of delivery mechanisms. For existing traffic safety clients, we provide full turnkey photo enforcement and citation management services, supported by the deployment of our hardware and software solutions. The programs are contracted directly with local and state government agencies. For vehicle recognition services, we offer a channel business partner program through a rapidly growing network of reseller partners. Customer agreements are typically attained through specific proposals we submit in response to government requests for proposal (“RFP”), or through reseller negotiations with commercial customers. Our resellers purchase hardware and software subscriptions from Rekor and resell them to their end-customers.
  
 We maintain an in-house staff of channel partner managers, business development and proposal professionals who are responsible for identifying opportunities, finding and responding to RFPs, and growing and supporting our reseller network.
  
 Our in-house proposal professionals focus on public sector-specific state, local and federal government agency-related procurement opportunities and also support our Partner Program by mining, researching and tracking of funded RFPs solicitation opportunities and capturing meaningful customer intelligence to develop successful bid solutions that support our objectives.
  
 We launched the Rekor Partner Program (“Partner Program”) in January 2020 to establish a network of qualified and trusted business partners who help to deliver our products and services worldwide. The Partner Program is open to technology solution providers, resellers, and integrators who want to deliver world class vehicle recognition solutions to customers in multiple business segments. These segments include public safety, security and surveillance, electronic toll collection, parking operations, banking and insurance, supply chain logistics, traffic management, and retail customer experience. Each partner is carefully vetted and selected by Rekor based on several qualifying factors including industry expertise, customer outreach, financial stability, past history, and geographic footprint.

 We offer three levels of membership, with varying degrees of commitment and benefits. “Authorized Resellers” and “Premier Partners” are both resellers who receive a discount to our MSRP pricing for software and hardware solutions. They sign and manage their own customer agreements and are responsible for technology implementation and first level maintenance and support. Rekor provides an array of services to program partners including second level technical support, free training, not-for-resale demo systems at a discount to MSRP, and assistance with proposal development. The Rekor Ambassador membership level is for those companies and individuals who desire to promote and sell Rekor products and services, but do not have the capability to provide direct customer support. Once approved, Rekor Ambassadors receive the authorization and support mechanisms to sell Rekor products and solutions to customers, who sign agreements directly with Rekor. Customer agreements, technology implementation, and first and second level maintenance and support are Rekor’s responsibility.
  
 In October 2020, we launched an updated eCommerce platform to allow municipalities and businesses to conveniently purchase a full range of Rekor's high-value vehicle recognition solutions with just a credit card and a click. The eCommerce platform enables self-service sign up and a range of subscription options while also acting as a funnel directly to sales support if customers need more information. Our eCommerce platform also includes our first mobile ALPR application, Rekor Go. Rekor Go brings the power artificial intelligence driven vehicle and license plate recognition to the mobile devices of a broad array of commercial users. In January 2021, we began to establish our digital marketing channel to expand brand awareness and increase traffic to our eCommerce platform through digital media. 
  
 Competition

 Our current emphasis is on products and services that include vehicle recognition features. There are currently many competitors who provide products and services of this type. Typically, these competitors provide camera systems that employ optical character recognition (“OCR”) software to analyze electronically captured images and produce license plate information. These competitors include divisions or subsidiaries of large multi-national companies, such as Siemens, Motorola, Leonardo, Bosch and Genetec. Other competitors who rely primarily on OCR include Alert Systems, Arvoo, CA Traffic, Clearview, HTS, Kapsh, MAV, Nexcom, ParkingEye, Petards, PIPS Technology, TagMaster and Tattle. Except in a very limited environment, traditional OCR based software systems rely on expensive specially designed cameras.
 
 We believe that a competitive advantage of our core software is that it can produce highly accurate data using most of the IP cameras on the market today. Because our core software can successfully analyze images produced by the typically lower-cost cameras used in existing security and surveillance systems, it can be used to add vehicle identification functionality to those systems without the need to use specialized equipment. As a result, we are well positioned to serve this market and can currently provide operators of existing security systems significant advantages in accuracy, usability and price that provide us with a competitive edge. In some cases, however, we have licensed our products and services to some of the vehicle recognition competitors listed above for use in camera systems designed for specific applications. We intend to continue to license our software on a non-exclusive basis to competitors in the vehicle recognition industry.
  
 Although we believe there is no competitor that provides a similarly accurate and cost-effective suite of products and services, we view our competition in the public safety and security areas as two distinct categories – traditional OCR-based ALPR companies and newer software-only companies, some merely deploying OCR based technology on newer IP cameras and others working to develop software using various AI processes. These “software only” companies include ARH, HIK Vision, Inex Tech, Ironyun Analytics, NDIRS, Neural Labs, Plate Smart and Sighthound. Our vehicle recognition software has been designed using an AI process commonly referred to as “machine learning” or more specifically “deep learning.” This process involves intensive analysis of large amounts of data using specialized neural network algorithms. For more than five years, our core software has been continuously updated through machine learning using millions of images from around the world. Direct comparisons or head-to-head competitive studies by several law enforcement customers and independent engineers have indicated that our software and systems have better capture rates and a greater degree of accuracy for license plate identification than other competitors. Another unique advantage of our software is that, in addition to country, state of origin and license plate number, it can identify in real-time the vehicle make, model, color, body type, and direction of travel.

 Our services are increasingly being used in the electronic tolling industry. There are a number of large, well established multi-national electronic tolling services companies relying primarily on RFID technology that have large, long-term contracts which involve extensive infrastructure installations. In recent years, automated license plate reading systems have increasingly replaced manual toll taking for vehicles that are not equipped with RFID technologies compatible with the toll operator’s system. We believe that the level of accuracy that can be achieved with our core software provides us with a competitive edge in connection with this movement to replace manual systems. We also believe that direct vehicle recognition should ultimately be recognized as a more efficient and cost-effective means of toll collection than the use of RFID systems. We have recently introduced additional pricing tiers of our Rekor CarCheck product to accommodate the increased level of interest in leveraging our technology to address backlogs and streamline real-time processing. While we are not yet in a position to undertake a full-scale entry into this market, this recent growth is helping us to evaluate our options as to how best to proceed. 
  
  Competitive Strengths
  
 In the public safety and vehicle recognition market, we believe we have, and can further develop, the following competitive strengths:
  
  ●
   Higher Accuracy Rates for Vehicle Recognitions. Most vehicle recognition systems currently in place are accurate only within specified parameters of vehicle speed, viewing angles and lighting conditions. We believe our AI software achieves superior accuracy rates under broader parameters of vehicle speed, camera viewing angles and lighting conditions.

 
  ●
   Ability to Detect Vehicle Make, Model, Body Type and Color. We believe the ability to determine the make, model, body type and color of a vehicle, in addition to the number and resident jurisdiction of a license plate, significantly enhances the value of our products and services as compared to systems that provide more limited recognition data and/or lower accuracy rates.

 
  ●
   Functionality with any IP Cameras. The optical character recognition-based systems marketed by our competitors in the public safety and vehicle recognition market often require customized cameras, while our AI software supports images captured by almost any digital camera that provides images that can be sent over the internet. This allows us to create products and solutions using relatively inexpensive, consumer-grade, mass market components that are readily available, significantly smaller and lighter, and less expensive than products currently being used.

 
  ●
   Increased Mobility. Because of the range and size of the cameras that can be used with our AI software, Rekor Recognition’s solutions have significant advantages for use in mobile applications, such as law enforcement vehicles.


  ●
   On-device Processing for Smartphones. With the launch of Rekor Go, we believe we introduced the first on-device license plate recognition app for handheld devices, allowing the user to capture plates and receive real time alerts where Wi-Fi or cellular service is limited. We expect to bring this technology to additional industries, first with Rekor Blue™ for law enforcement in the first half of 2021. Rekor Blue will synchronize with our existing platforms, creating an expanded vehicle recognition ecosystem for law enforcement, and allow mobile video and image capture at much higher speeds.


  ●
   Edge Processing. The Company’s technology delivers low latency alerting via defined edge processing with all computing outside the Cloud happening at the edge of the network, and more specifically in applications where real-time processing of data is required. Edge processing on “instant data” that is real-time data generated by sensors or users.


  ●
   Cross Agency Functionality. The Rekor One platform will support multiple community safety, intelligent roadway and revenue generation activities. Rekor One will provide government agencies with a comprehensive vehicle intelligence system that supports multiple agency-specific missions. With Rekor One, governments will be able to leverage their existing IP cameras and transform them into a safe and smart multi-dimensional intelligent roadway network. By interfacing with multiple databases and operating systems, Rekor One can allow governmental units to observe security and privacy protocols and fractionalize costs based on relative end user value. Each participating agency receives a unique user interface and dashboard, which draws on Rekor One’s unified vehicle recognition intelligence to provide data customized to the agency’s specific needs. This will eliminate redundant systems and single function applications to help use public funds wisely.

  Growth Strategies
 
 Our vehicle recognition product portfolio sits at the intersection of the video surveillance, video management software and ALPR markets. We believe there are significant opportunities within these markets which could lead to the expansion our business. Growth in vehicle recognition is being driven by multiple government and law enforcement applications as well as a broad range of new applications, such as customer service, tolling and school security.
 
 In addition, we believe that growth will be impacted by an increased demand for improvements in security, public safety and business intelligence that will in turn lead to increased spending in infrastructure, government spending on intelligent transportation systems, deployment of security and surveillance and traffic enforcement applications.
 
 Rapid urbanization, increased globalization, and the increased awareness about the human impact on the planet are all driving factors for intelligent transportation and the smart highway market. Additionally, the growing trend toward the adoption of smart cities is also expected to expand the prospects for the smart highway market.
 
 We plan to continue to pursue growth of our Rekor One™ platform across relevant systems to provide vehicle information to different state municipalities. The Rekor One platform can be shared among state agencies to support additional community safety, intelligent roadway and revenue generation activities. We will look to leverage our success with our Oklahoma UVED program to other state governments. Currently, Florida, Tennessee, New York and Texas have introduced legislation to authorize UVED, and other states may do the same as the program can be a significant source of new revenue for cash strapped state budgets.
 
 We use AI to extract information about the movements of vehicles and other objects on the roadway for the purpose of enhancing safety, increasing operational efficiencies, reducing congestion and improving the environment—this is “AI with a purpose”. We believe we can play an important role in enabling intelligent roadways and smart cities.
 
 These market trends create significant opportunities for us to expand our market presence while developing relationships with both new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers.
 
 Our current emphasis on growth is to concentrate available resources on expanding sales of products and services that exploit the competitive advantages of our vehicle recognition and edge processing technology. In particular, we are working to further develop our existing cloud-based subscription services for smaller clients and to license our technology to original equipment manufacturers and large government and commercial customers for use with new and existing security, logistics, traffic management, vehicle location and customer loyalty systems.
 
 As we work to develop our sales and marketing capabilities, we expect our efforts with respect to products and services to be concentrated principally on subscription-based solutions. 
 
  We may also use a portion of our cash on hand and common stock for acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies, including companies that might benefit from the use of our technology. However, we do not have agreements or commitments to enter into any such acquisitions or investments at this time. We are looking to be a leader in the industry through organic growth and accelerate our growth and expand our capabilities through strategic mergers and acquisitions.

  Our History
  
 Rekor Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly known as Novume Solutions, Inc. (“Novume”), was formed in February 2017 to effectuate the mergers of, and become a holding company for KeyStone Solutions, Inc. (“KeyStone”) and Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. (“Rekor Recognition”), formerly known as Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. (“Brekford”).
 
 Our services are currently provided through wholly owned subsidiaries: Rekor Recognition and as of March 12, 2019, OpenALPR Software Solutions, LLC (“OpenALPR”).
  
 Previously, we provided professional services and staffing solutions to the government contracting and the aerospace and aviation industries through our Professional Services Segment. The Professional Services Segment included our wholly owned subsidiaries AOC Key Solutions Inc. (“AOC Key Solutions”), Global Technical Services, Inc. (“GTS” or “TeamGlobal”), Firestorm Solutions, LLC (Firestorm Solutions”) and Firestorm Franchising, LLC (“Firestorm Franchising” and, together with Firestorm Solutions, “Firestorm”). As part of the development of a new line of products for the public safety and security markets, we determined that our resources were best concentrated on vehicle recognition products and services and began to consider dispositions in our Professional Services Segment. Concurrently, we reorganized and retooled our product development, business development and administrative resources to better serve our Technology Segment. On April 2, 2020, we sold AOC Key Solutions. As of June 29, 2020, we sold Team Global and determined that all the remaining operations that comprised our Professional Services Segment met the criteria to be presented as discontinued.
 
 During 2019, we also disposed of or discontinued our Firestorm operations. On June 1, 2019, we sold all the interest we had acquired in Secure Education, LLC, which we acquired on January 1, 2018, and discontinued operations of BC Management. In connection with these actions we recognized a write-off of intangible assets of $242,000. In addition, in June 2019, we discontinued the operations of Firestorm Franchising, resulting in a write-off of an additional $1,310,000 in intangible assets related to Firestorm in the second quarter of 2019.
  
  Acquisitions
  
 On March 12, 2019, we completed the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition.
  
 Additional information concerning the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition and the restructuring of Firestorm is provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”
Reportable Segments
  
  As part of our strategic shift, all operations related to the Professional Services segment have been classified as discontinued operations. As of January 1, 2020, we have one reportable segment. Continuing operations are all operations that previously were reported as part of the Technology Segment.
 Employees
  
 As of February 28, 2021, Rekor had 109 employees, of which 108 were full time and one was considered part-time. We consider our employee relations to be good. To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed and do not expect our growth efforts to be constrained by a lack of qualified personnel. We will continue to engage additional highly qualified personnel for our public safety and vehicle recognition markets.
 Seasonality
  
 We generate revenues from licensing and subscriptions to our and products and services. Therefore, we do not currently anticipate significant seasonality impact on our revenues. Should our penetration of tolling and other markets involving per recognition fees expand, we would expect to become more subject to seasonal traffic patterns.

  Insurance and Risk Management
  
 We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury, property and economic loss. We consider our present limits of coverage, deductibles, and reserves to be adequate. Whenever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through the use of quality assurance and control, risk management, workplace safety, and other similar methods.
  
 Risk management is an integral part of our project management approach for fixed-price contracts and our project execution process. We also evaluate risk through internal risk analyses in which our management reviews higher-risk projects, contracts, or other business decisions that require corporate legal and risk management approval.
  
  Regulation
  
 We are regulated in some of the fields in which we operate. When working with governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts. These laws and regulations contain terms that, among other things may require certification and disclosure of all costs or pricing data in connection with various contract negotiations. We are subject to the laws and regulations that restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes.
  
 To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
