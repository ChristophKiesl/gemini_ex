ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 
We are focused on the research and development of nervous system therapies based on our proprietary human neuronal stem cells and our small molecule compounds with the ultimate goal of gaining approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration or FDA, and its international counterparts to market and commercialize such therapies. We are headquartered in Germantown, Maryland.
 
Our technology base has produced three primary assets: our NSI-189 small molecule program, our NSI-566 stem cell therapy program and our novel and proprietary new chemical entity screening platform.
 
Our patented technologies enable the commercial-scale production of multiple types of central nervous system stem cells, which are under development for the potential treatment of central nervous system diseases and conditions. In addition, this ability to generate human neural stem cell lines provides a platform for chemical screening and discovery of novel compounds that we believe may be used to stimulate the brain's capacity to regenerate neurons, thereby potentially treating or reversing pathologies associated with certain nervous system conditions. This proprietary screening platform enabled our discovery of NSI-189.
 
We have developed and maintain what we believe is a strong portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the proprietary base for our research and development efforts. We own or exclusively license over 20 U.S. issued and pending patents and over 120 foreign issued and pending patents in the field of regenerative medicine, related to our stem cell technologies as well as our small molecule compounds.
 
We believe our technology base, in combination with our expertise, and established collaborations with major research institutions, could facilitate the development and commercialization of products for use in the treatment of a wide array of nervous system disorders including neurodegenerative conditions and regenerative repair of acute and chronic disease.

Clinical Programs 
 
We have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the pre-clinical and clinical development of our small molecule compounds and our stem cell therapeutics. Below is a description of our most advanced clinical programs, their intended indication, current stage of development and our expected future development plans:
 


In January 2016 we announced a strategic refocusing to concentrate our resources primarily on our NSI-189 small molecule program. As part of this refocusing, we announced that we will seek external funding to defray all, or substantially all, of the costs associated with our NSI-566 stem cell therapy program. Although we are in active conversations with a number of funding sources to achieve this goal and minimize any delay in progressing our stem cell therapy programs, there can be no assurance that any such funding source will ultimately be secured.
 
NSI - 189 (Small Molecule Pharmaceutical Compound). 
 
Our lead asset, NSI-189, is a novel new chemical entity. NSI-189 is currently in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).
 
Research indicates that there may be a link between impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and psychiatric disorders such as depression. We believe that NSI-189 may provide an effective treatment for patients suffering from MDD by promoting synaptogenesis or neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Results to date indicate that NSI-189 promotes neurogenesis in rodents and exerts anti-depression effects in MDD patients1. NSI-189 stimulates neurogenesis of human hippocampus derived neural stem cells in vitro and stimulates neurogenesis in mouse hippocampus in vivo therefore we believe NSI-189 may be a powerful anti-depressant. NSI-189 is believed to have a highly specific effect in the hippocampus, a well-known neurogenic region in adult CNS.
 
In a Phase 1B study in subjects with MDD, NSI-189 showed strong potential for efficacy on both depression and cognition scales. Additionally, data from the study indicated that the compound appears to impart a durable effect. While the mechanism of action is not yet fully understood, our data suggest that NSI-189 works by a different mechanism of action than current therapies. Accordingly, we believe that NSI-189 may have a better therapeutic response as well as a favorable side-effect profile when compared to currently marketed products. 
 
We are currently conducting a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial for the treatment of MDD in an outpatient setting. The study is designed to randomize 220 subjects in three cohorts (two active doses plus placebo), at 12 select trial sites. The trial design incorporates strategies to limit placebo effect. These include using experienced trial sites, a placebo-reducing pre-screen process, and a second confirmatory diagnostic interview performed remotely by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

Study subjects are randomized to three cohorts: NSI-189 40 mg twice daily (BID), NSI-189 40 mg once daily (QD), or placebo. After the initial screening period, the dosing portion of the trial is 12 weeks in duration. There is a two week wash out period for those subject enrolled that were taking an anti-depressant at the time of screening. The primary endpoint is measurement on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary endpoints include scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ), the MGH Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale, the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale, and two computerized cognition measurements; Cogstate Brief Battery, and CogScreen. The study is 80% powered to show an improvement in the primary endpoint, compared to placebo, with an effect size of Cohen’s d=0.5 (p ≤ 0.05). Subjects eligible for the study must be diagnosed with major depressive disorder, recurrent, as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V2, (DSM-V), scoring 20 or greater on the MADRS, at screening and baseline and experiencing at least one eight-week MDD episode. The MADRS score will be confirmed to be 20 or greater via remote SAFER interview by an independent rater prior to the baseline visit. After the 12-week trial period, eligible subjects are given the opportunity to enroll in a separate six-month observational study to assess the durability of effect defined as the time until the start of a new antidepressant treatment (ADT). Both the interventional and the observational studies are being conducted under the direction of study principal investigator (PI) Maurizio Fava, MD, Executive Vice Chair, Department of Psychiatry and Executive Director, Clinical Trials Network and Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital.
 
We enrolled the first subject in May 2016. In September, 2016 we announced that we had achieved 50% enrollment. In February, 2017 we announced that we had completed enrollment in the study. We expect to release the results of this study during the third quarter of 2017.
 
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
 
Major depressive disorder (also known as recurrent depressive disorder, clinical depression, major depression, unipolar depression, or unipolar disorder) is a mental disorder characterized by episodes of all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. MDD is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for persons age 15 to 44. In 2015, an estimated 16.1 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the prior year. This number represented 6.7% of all U.S. adults3. Treatment of MDD is characterized by a high rate of patient turnover due to low efficacy and high side-effects. It is estimated that 67% of patients will fail their first line therapy, 75% will then fail their second line prescription and 80% will then fail their third line prescription4. These factors combine to create a significant opportunity for a differentiated therapeutic agent, particularly one that may act through a novel mechanism of action.
 
Early Clinical Experience with NSI-189
 
Phase 1 Pharmacokinetics and Safety in Healthy Subjects
 
In February of 2011 we commenced a two-part Phase 1A clinical trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of NSI-189 in healthy volunteers. The first part of the study enrolled thirty-one healthy male and female subjects into a single ascending dose phase. Subjects were administered a single dose (40mg, 60mg, or 80mg) of NSI-189 or placebo. In the second part of the study, 10 subjects received single doses of 40mg oral NSI-189 under fed and fasting conditions in an open label cross-over design. All subjects completed the study. There were no clear gender effects on NSI-189 pharmacokinetics. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and no serious adverse events (AE) were noted. All AEs were considered mild in intensity and none were considered to have a reasonable causal relationship to study drug. NSI-189 was found to be safe and well tolerated at the tested doses.
 
In December of 2011, we received authorization from the FDA to commence a Phase 1B randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose escalation study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of NSI-189 phosphate in subjects5 with MDD. The primary outcome measure was to assess drug safety by number and severity of adverse events in drug versus the placebo group. A safety protocol also included a comparison between NSI-189 and placebo of vital signs, standard physical examination, ECG, EEG, standard clinical laboratory tests (hematology and biochemistry), standard neurological exam and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Secondary measurements included pharmacokinetics, and exploratory assessments included clinical scales such as the MADRS, CGI-I, SDQ, and the MGH CPFQ.

Criteria for subjects to be eligible to participate in the study included: a MADRS score of 15 to 30, inclusive, at screening and baseline; and diagnosed with MDD, or recurrent MDD, per DSM-IV-TR criteria and reconfirmed by SCID-CT. Subjects must have had at least two prior depressive episodes and have been currently or had historically been treated with antidepressants. The first cohort received 40 mg QD, the second cohort 40 mg BID, and the third cohort 40 mg three times per day (TID). 24 subjects with MDD were studied, with their diagnosis and illness severity confirmed through an independent, remote SAFER interview from Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Trial Network, Inc. (MGH CTNI) raters. Each cohort included at least 3 female subjects. Each subject underwent a screening for eligibility (Day -37 to Day -6 or -3) and eligible subjects were admitted into the unit on Day -5 to complete their wash-out before being confirmed for eligibility and for baseline assessments. Eligible subjects received daily dosing of investigational medicinal product (NSI-189 Phosphate or placebo) for 28 days starting on Day 1 and were followed for safety, PK, and PD until discharge. Subjects returned to the unit for extensive follow-up on Day 56 (± 3) and Day 84 (± 3) (End-of-study).
 
Trial data was presented in June 2014 at the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology Annual Meeting (ASCP), and published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry (Fava et al., 2015). NSI-189 was well tolerated and there were no serious (grade 4 or 5) adverse events. 
 
At the end of dosing, efficacy measurements showed statistically significant improvement over placebo on one subject-reported depression scale (SDQ) and one subject-reported cognition scale (CPFQ) and showed a medium to large size effect on all scales studied6.
 
Efficacy measurements (MADRS, SDQ, CGI-I and, CPFQ), showed a promising reduction in depressive and cognitive symptoms across all measures with statistically significant improvement in the SDQ and CPFQ scales, and a medium to large effect size for all measures at the cessation of dosing (day 28). These improvements persisted to day 84, 8 weeks after cessation of drug administration. In particular, depression symptoms showed a significant decrease at day 28 as measured by SDQ (P=0.02), with large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.90), which persisted to day 84, 8 weeks after cessation of drug administration (P=0.03), also with large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.10). In addition, CPFQ also showed a significant decrease at day 28 (P= 0.01) with large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.94) and at day 84, (P<0.01, Cohen's d = 1.20).

In summary, NSI-189, a novel neurogenic compound, has shown promise as a potential treatment for MDD in this Phase 1B, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study. It is our belief that NSI-189 may have a significant benefit on depressive and cognitive symptoms in patients with MDD and other related disorders.
 
Pre-Clinical Experience with NSI-189
 
Our preclinical research on NSI-189 is focused on elucidating its mechanism of action and investigating its potential utility as a broad neuroregenerative drug that can prevent or reverse various types of central and peripheral nerve degeneration and may have a significant cognitive benefit in diseases that impact memory and cognition. Recent preclinical data support the potential benefits of NSI-189 in indications beyond MDD.
 
Supportive data include the following results obtained in collaboration with academic partners:
 

1. | NSI-189 and cognition:
---+-----------------------


· | Treatment of normal mouse brain slices with NSI-189 produced a concentration and time dependent increase in the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) and short-term potentiation (STP), a measure of synaptic plasticity which is an in vitro biomarker of memory7.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NSI-189 treatment of brain slices from mice with a genetic defect that models Angelman Syndrome (which in humans leads to inherited mental retardation) restored LTP to normal levels7.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NSI-189 treatment preserved brain function and hippocampal proliferation at normal levels in a rat model of cognitive impairment induced by irradiation8.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | NSI-189 and neuroregeneration9:
---+--------------------------------


· | NSI-189 proved to be effective in the prevention and reversal of peripheral neuropathies in a mouse model of Type 1 diabetes and in the prevention of peripheral neuropathies in a mouse of Type 2 diabetes. Data from these studies, which includes reversal of neuropathic pain and decreased nerve conductance associated with the onset of diabetic symptoms, suggest that NSI-189 may have broad applicability in the treatment of central and peripheral neuropathies arising from diverse etiologies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | NSI-189 and neurogenesis10.
---+----------------------------


· | Oral administration of NSI-189 to rats with ischemic stroke led to a significant recovery from motor deficit. The improvements were maintained post cessation of dosing for the additional 12 week observational period. The sustained improvement suggests that NSI-189 initiated a host brain repair mechanism enabling tissue remodeling of the stroke brain. In cultured rat hippocampal cells, NSI-189 led to the upregulation of growth factors such as Stem Cell Factor (SCF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), as well as increasing neurite outgrowth.

We believe that these data support our view that NSI-189 may be effective in the treatment of a broad range of cognitive and neuroregenerative applications.
 
Mechanism of Action Studies with NSI-189
 
Evidence to date suggests that NSI-189 has a novel mechanism of action when compared to currently marketed therapies. Screening assays indicate that NSI-189 does not bind appreciably to known neurotransmitter receptors or transporters. These tests have included 48 neurotransmitter related receptors, ion channels, and enzymes, plus in excess of 450 protein kinases. The resulting data lead us to believe that NSI-189 acts via a mechanism that is distinct from currently marketed SSRI, SNRI, or NDRI compounds 
 
Discovery of NSI-189: Our Proprietary and Novel Screening Platform
 
NSI-189 was discovered using our stem cell-based screening platform. Our human neural stem cell lines form the foundation for functional cell-based assays used to screen for small molecule compounds that can impact biologically relevant outcomes such as neurogenesis, synapse formation, and protection against toxic insults. We have developed over 300 unique stem cell lines representing multiple different regions of the developing brain and spinal cord at multiple different time points in development, enabling the generation of almost unlimited numbers of physiologically relevant human neural cells for screening, target validation, and mechanism-of-action studies. This platform provides us with a unique and powerful tool to identify new chemical entities to treat a broad range of nervous system conditions.
 
The discovery process for NSI-189 started with the initiation of a high content screen of 10,269 small molecules and led to the identification of 16 compounds that were capable of inducing neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons in hippocampal stem cells in culture. These 16 compounds were then tested for toxicity in vitro and in mice, and were evaluated for their ability to induce neurogenesis in healthy adult mice after oral administration. Seven of the starting 16 compounds, representing three structural classes, were advanced as orally active neurogenic leads. Compounds were evaluated in three mouse models of depression and NSI-189 was advanced as the lead small molecule candidate due to its anti-depressant behavioral effect, and its ability to both induce hippocampal neurogenesis and increase hippocampal volume.
 
NSI - 566 (Stem Cells) 
 
The human central nervous system (CNS) has limited capacity for regeneration following injury or the onset of disease. Traditional therapies have mainly focused on minimizing the progression or symptoms of CNS disease or injury, but have not been effective at repairing the underlying cause of such disease. The focus of our cell therapy initiatives is the regeneration of neural function which has been lost to disease or injury. We believe that replacing or supplementing damaged or dead neural cells with fully functional ones may be a useful therapeutic strategy in treating many diseases and conditions of the central nervous system.
 
Our proprietary technology enables the isolation and large-scale expansion of regionally specific neural stem cells from all areas of the developing human brain and spinal cord, and enables the generation of commercially useful quantities of highly characterized allogeneic human neural stem cells that can be transplanted into patients to mitigate the consequences of CNS diseases or injury. We have developed and optimized processes that allow us to manufacture these cells under Good Manufacturing Practices or cGMP compliant conditions as required by the FDA for use in clinical trials, and have generated cell banks which we believe are sufficient to provide material to meet all our requirements through to completion of Phase 3 studies. We have exclusive licenses for manufacture and use of the surgical platform and cannula that enable administration of the cells to the spinal cord for treatment utilizing our stem cells. Based on our preclinical data we believe that our human neural stem cells will differentiate into neurons and glia after grafting into the patient and will replace the function of cells lost to disease or injury.
 
Our lead stem cell program is the spinal cord-derived neural stem cell line, NSI-566, which is being tested for treatment of paralysis due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease), stroke, and spinal cord injury. To date we have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 safety and dose escalation studies in subjects with ALS, a Phase1 safety and dose escalation study in subjects with motor deficits due to ischemic stroke, and a Phase 1 safety study in subjects with chronic spinal cord injury or cSCI. Each of these studies are currently evaluating patients in a long-term follow-up stage.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement. In 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that between 14,000 and 15,000 Americans have ALS11. In ALS, nerve cells (motor neurons) waste away or die, and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body. As the condition progresses, muscles in the chest area stop working, making it difficult or impossible to breathe. NSI-566 is under development as a potential treatment for ALS by providing cells designed to nurture and protect the patients’ remaining motor neurons; and possibly repair some motor neurons which have not yet died but which are diseased. We received orphan designation by the FDA for NSI-566 in ALS.
Motor Deficits Due to Ischemic Stroke
 
Ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, occurs as a result of an obstruction within a vessel supplying blood to the brain. Annually, approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer stroke12, of which it is estimated that 87% are ischemic strokes13. Post-stroke motor deficits include paralysis in arms and legs and can be permanent. We believe that NSI-566 may provide an effective treatment for restoring motor deficits resulting from ischemic stroke by both creating new circuitry in the area of injury and through repairing and or nurturing diseased cells to improve function in patients.
Chronic Spinal Cord Injury
 
Spinal cord injury, or SCI, generally refers to any injury to the spinal cord that is caused by trauma instead of disease, although in some cases it can be the result of diseases. It is estimated that there are 17,00014 new cases of SCI per year and that at any given time, there are between 243,000 and 347,000 people in the United States that are living with SCI14. Chronic spinal cord injury refers to the time after the initial hospitalization. SCIs are most often traumatic, caused by lateral bending, dislocation, rotation, axial loading, and hyperflexion or hyperextension of the cord or cauda equina. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of SCIs, while other causes include falls, work-related accidents, sports injuries, and penetrating injuries such as stab or gunshot wounds. In certain instances, SCIs can also be of a non-traumatic origin, as in the case of cancer, infection, intervertebral disc disease, vertebral injury and spinal cord vascular disease. We believe that NSI-566 may provide an effective treatment for chronic spinal cord injury by “bridging the gap” in the spinal cord circuitry created in traumatic spinal cord injury and providing new cells to help transmit the signal from the brain to points at or below the point of injury.
Clinical Experience with NSI-566 
 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
 
In January 2010, we commenced a Phase 1 trial of NSI-566 in ALS at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the safety of our proposed treatment and procedure in a total of 15 subjects. The dosing of subjects in the Phase 1 trial, as designed, was completed in August of 2012. We commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial in subjects suffering from ALS in September of 2013 to further test the feasibility and safety of the treatment and procedure, and maximum tolerated dose of cells. The Phase 2 dose escalation trial enrolled 15 ambulatory subjects in five different dosing cohorts. Each patient in the final cohort had two separate surgeries.
 
We have completed all of the transplantations and the observation period of six months after the last surgery concluded in January 2015. The Phase 2 ALS clinical trial met the primary safety endpoints and established what we believe to be the maximum safe tolerated dose of 16 million cells delivered in 40 injections over two surgeries. In September 2015, nine-month Phase 2 and combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 data from our ALS trials were presented at the American Neurological Association Meeting by principal investigator Eva Feldman, MD, PhD, Director of the A. Alfred Taubman Medical Research Institute and Director of Research of the ALS Clinic at the University of Michigan Health. The data showed that the intraspinal transplantation of the cells was safe and well tolerated. Subjects from both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 continue to be monitored for long-term follow-up evaluations

Ischemic Stroke
 
During the fourth Quarter of 2013 we commenced a human clinical trial for treatment of motor deficits due to ischemic stroke. The trial is being conducted at BaYi Brain Hospital in Beijing, China utilizing our spinal cord stem cells. This Phase 1 multiple dose escalation study is intended to evaluate safety of direct injections of NSI-566 into the brain. The Phase 1 portion of the trial was designed to confirm the maximum safe tolerated dose.
 
In March, 2016, we completed dosing the final planned cohort, for a total of nine subjects. Subjects are currently being monitored through their 24 month observational follow-up period. The trial is being conducted by Suzhou Neuralstem, a wholly owned subsidiary of Neuralstem in China.
 
To date, the Ischemic Stroke program has been funded substantially by Neuralstem.
 
Chronic Spinal Cord Injury
 
During the first quarter of 2013, we received authorization from the FDA to commence our proposed Phase 1 clinical trial to treat chronic spinal cord injury. The trial, which is taking place at The University of California, San Diego or UCSD, commenced during the third quarter of 2014 and the first subject was treated in October 2014. The study enrolled four AISA A15 thoracic spinal cord injury subjects (motor and sensory complete), one to two years post-injury at the time of stem cell treatment. In January of 2016 we reported six month follow-up data on all four subjects. The stem cell treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated by the subjects enrolled and there were no serious adverse events. A self-reported ability to contract some muscles below the level of injury in one of the four subjects treated was confirmed via clinical and electrophysiological follow-up examinations. All subjects will be followed for five years.
 
FDA has approved the protocol amendment to treat an additional cohort of four cervical spinal cord injury patients.
 
Substantially all of the clinical costs of this study have been, and will continue to be, funded by grants arranged through UCSD.
 
Pre-Clinical Experience with NSI-566 and other candidates for our stem cell pipeline
 
Our preclinical studies with NSI-566 have served to provide a solid foundation for our ongoing clinical trials by demonstrating performance and efficacy of this cell line in animal models for ALS (Yan et al., 2006; Hefferan et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2011), spinal cord injury (Cizkova et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2012; van Gorp et al., 2013), and ischemic stroke (Tajiri et al., 2014), and demonstrated safety in large animals (Usvald et al., 2010; Raore et al., 2011). Additional studies involving NSI-566 or other proprietary cell lines are directed at identifying new therapeutic candidates.
 
In addition to NSI-566 we have developed an inventory of over 300 unique stem cell lines. These stem cell lines include cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, hindbrain, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We believe these lines possess unique properties and represent candidates for both transplantation-based strategies to treat disease and for screening of compound libraries to discover novel drug therapies.
 

· | NSI-566: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 TBI occurs when a sudden mechanical force induces damage to the brain. TBIs result in cognitive and motor deficits or death. Damage may come from the forceful collision of the skull with a solid object, such as during a fall or car accident, or may be caused by an object penetrating the skull and disrupting brain tissue. The Company is in the midst of a collaboration with investigators at the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis to determine if transplantation of NSI-566 can lead to an improvement in motor function in an animal model for penetrating TBI.
 

· | HK532-IGF-1: Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
--+---------------------------------------

 Neuralstem’s HK532-IGF-1 is a proprietary line of cortical neural stem cells engineered to express insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which has been shown to have wide-ranging neuroprotective properties. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain that leads to cognitive decline and memory loss which is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. Researchers at the University of Michigan evaluated the ability of the human neural stem cell line HK-532.IGF1 to reverse the cognitive impact of neurodegeneration in a mouse model of AD (McGinley et al., 2016). Animals with HK532-IGF-1 transplanted in the peri-hippocampus, performed better on hippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks than untreated mice, demonstrating both enhanced learning cognitive processes and memory consolidation.

· | NSI-777: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and demyelinating diseases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 In the case of MS and other demyelinating diseases, the myelin sheath that wraps and insulates axons in the central nervous system can become damaged, leading to inefficient transmission of signals along the nerves of the brain and spinal cord. This loss of conductivity may lead to profound symptoms, including loss of vision, sensation, and muscle strength, Myelin is generated in the CNS by a neural cell type called oligodendrocytes. The Company has developed a human neural stem cell line, NSI-777, that gives rise to large quantities of these myelin-generating cells after grafting in animals. In collaboration with researchers at Johns Hopkins University, we have recently shown16 that NSI-777 has high capacity for myelinating axons after grafting into animal models for demyelination. We will continue to pursue NSI-777 to further develop this candidate for potential use in treatment of human demyelinating diseases.
 
Our Technologies
 
Stem Cells. 
 
Our stem cell based technology has both therapeutic and screening characteristics. 
 
From a therapeutic perspective, our stem cell based technology enables the isolation and large-scale expansion of regionally specific, human neural stem cells from all areas of the developing human brain and spinal cord thus enabling the generation of physiologically relevant human neurons of all types. We believe that our stem cell technology will assist the body in producing new cells to replace malfunctioning or dead cells as a way to treat disease and injury. Many significant and currently untreatable human diseases arise from the loss or malfunction of specific cell types in the body. Our focus is the development of effective methods to generate replacement cells from neural stem cells. We believe that replacing damaged, malfunctioning or dead neural cells with fully functional ones may be a useful therapeutic strategy in treating many diseases and conditions of the central nervous system. 
Small Molecule Pharmaceutical Compounds. 
 
Utilizing our proprietary stem cell derived screening capability, we have discovered and patented a series of small molecule compounds. We believe our low molecular weight compounds can efficiently cross the blood/brain barrier. In mice, research indicated that these compounds both stimulate neurogenesis of the hippocampus and increase its volume. We believe these compounds may promote synaptogenesis or neurogenesis in the human hippocampus in indications such as MDD.
Research
 
Substantial resources have been and will be devoted to our research programs. Our efforts are directed at developing therapies utilizing our stem cells and small molecule regenerative drug candidates. This research is conducted internally, through the use of third party laboratories and consulting companies under our direct supervision, and through collaboration with academic institutes.
Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture our cells both in-house and on an outsourced basis. We outsource the manufacturing of our pharmaceutical compounds and our clinical supply of stem cells to cGMP compliant third party manufacturers. We manufacture neural stem cells in-house for use in our research and collaborative programs.
Intellectual Property
 
We have developed and maintain what we believe is a strong portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the basis for our research and development efforts. We own or exclusively license over 10 U.S. issued and pending patents and over 60 foreign issued and pending patents related to our stem cell technologies for use in treating disease and injury. We own over 10 U.S. issued and pending patents and over 60 foreign issued and pending patents related to our small molecule compounds. Our issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2017 through 2034. Two of our original patents covering methods and composition of matter associated with our stem cell technologies expired in 2016. In our opinion the expiration of these patents is not material to our intellectual property.
 
When appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe will provide us with a competitive advantage. We accomplish this by filing patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, although not always, we file patent applications both in the United States and in select international markets. In addition, we plan to obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interests.

In addition to patenting our technologies, we also rely upon trade-secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and take active measures to control access to that information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors.
 
Our policy is to require our employees, consultants and significant scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers to execute confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual's or entity’s relationship with us, is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual or entity in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property.
 
The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. The coverage sought in a patent application can be denied or significantly reduced before or after the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our pending applications will result in the issuance of patents, or if any existing or future patents will provide significant protection or commercial advantage or will be circumvented by others. Since patent applications are secret until the applications are published (usually eighteen months after the earliest effective filing date), and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from our pending or future patent applications or, if issued, that such patents will be of commercial benefit to us, afford us adequate protection from competing products, or not be challenged or declared invalid.
 
In the event that a third party has also filed a patent application relating to inventions claimed in our patent applications, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial uncertainties and costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that our patents, if issued, would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
A number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or have been issued patents relating to cell therapy, stem cells and other technologies potentially relevant to or required by our proposed products. We cannot predict which, if any, of such applications will issue as patents or the claims that might be allowed.
 
If third party patents or patent applications contain claims infringed by our technology and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, if at all, or be able to develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology. If we are unable to obtain such licenses or develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology at a reasonable cost, we may not be able to develop certain products commercially. There can be no assurance that we will not be obliged to defend ourselves in court against allegations of infringement of third party patents. Patent litigation is very expensive and could consume substantial resources and create significant uncertainties. An adverse outcome in such a suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, or require us to cease using such technology.
 
 Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies and chemical and medical products companies. Many of these companies are well-established and possess greater resources for technical, research, development, financial, sales and marketing initiatives than we do. Other, less well-established companies have formed or may form strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that may provide research and development and commercialization advantages to these competitors. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing. Moreover, many of these competitors may be able obtain patent protection, or FDA and other regulatory approvals that may impede our freedom to develop and commercialize our programs.
 
The diseases and medical conditions we are targeting have a demographic in which there are large numbers of patients who do not respond to current therapies or have limited therapies available. Nevertheless, we expect that our technologies and product candidates, if or when approved, will compete with a variety of therapeutic products and procedures offered by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investigating new drugs and therapeutic approaches for the same or similar indications. These companies’ efforts may achieve new efficacy profiles, extend the therapeutic window for such products, alter the prognosis of these diseases, or prevent their onset. We believe that our products, if or when approved, will attempt to compete with these products principally on the basis of improved and extended efficacy and safety and their overall economic benefit to the health care system. Competition for our products may be in the form of existing and new drugs, other forms of cell transplantation, surgical procedures, gene therapy or other proprietary technology and expertise. We expect that all of these products will compete with our product candidates, if or when approved, based on efficacy, safety, cost and intellectual property positions. We cannot be certain that that other entities have not filed patents that block our freedom to commercialize our programs and we may be required to seek licenses from these entities in order to commercialize certain of our proposed products, and such licenses may not be granted or be extremely expensive to obtain.

If we develop products that receive regulatory approval, they would then have to compete for market acceptance and market share. For our potential products, an important success factor will be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. This timing will be a function of the relative speed with which we and our competitors can develop products, complete the clinical testing and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market. These competitive products may also impact the timing of clinical testing and approval processes by limiting the number of clinical investigators and subjects available to test our potential products.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in our research and development and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of our proposed products. The nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us will vary depending on the nature of any products we may develop. Governmental authorities, including the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, regulate the design, development, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion and marketing of pharmaceutical products, including drugs and biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations, and, for biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product seizures, import restrictions, injunctive actions and criminal prosecutions of both companies and individuals. In addition, administrative remedies can involve requests to recall violative products; the refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts; or the refusal to approve pending product approval applications until manufacturing or other alleged deficiencies are brought into compliance. The FDA also has the authority to cause the withdrawal of approval of a marketed product or to impose labeling restrictions. The process of obtaining approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted.
United States Product Development Process
 
We believe that, in the United States, our human neuronal stem cell candidates are regulated as biologic pharmaceuticals, or biologics, and our small-molecule compounds are regulated as drugs.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

Completion of preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical or biological
products, generally conducted in the laboratory and in animal studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs), and
applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations to evaluate the potential efficacy
and safety of the product candidate;
Submission of the results of these studies to the FDA as part of
an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin;
Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials
according to cGMPs and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information,
to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
Submission to the FDA of a Biological License Application, or BLA,
for any biologic or a New Drug Application, or NDA, for any new chemical entity drug we seek to market that includes substantive
evidence of safety, purity, and potency, or safety and effectiveness from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing
facility or facilities where the product is produced, packaged and distributed, to assess compliance with cGMPs, to assure that
the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and,
if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial
sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
FDA review and approval of the NDA, or licensure, of the BLA.

Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process.
 

Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested
for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently
toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
Phase 2. The product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible
adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine
dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy,
potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are
intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be required and conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated similar trials. Similarly, an institutional review board, or IRB, can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Human cell-based therapies in the field of regenerative medicine are relatively novel. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of such products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 
United States Review and Approval Process 
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA or NDA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA or NDA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information as well as a significant user fee. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA or NDA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA or NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and in each case, whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP or GTP, if applicable. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA or NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA or NDA without a REMS, if required.
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval via a letter detailing such deficiencies. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the FDA denies an application, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified by the FDA, or withdraw the application.
 
United States Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.

In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of some, or all, clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP and GTP regulations, as applicable. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, GTP and other laws.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 
European, China and Other Regulatory Review and Approval 
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe, China and other countries will be necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union, China and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for biological and pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval.
Other Health Care Laws
 
In the event any of proposed products are ever approved for marketing, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved.  These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician sunshine and privacy and security laws and regulations.
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our business. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action.
