Item 1. Business.
Organization
All references to the “Liquidating LLC” refer to New York REIT Liquidating LLC and all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” refer to New York REIT Liquidating LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to the Company’s ownership, investment in, and rights and obligations and actions with respect to, WWP Holdings LLC or Worldwide Plaza refer to the interests, rights and obligations, and actions of the Company’s subsidiary ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC, except that references relating to $90.7 million cash reserve established in 2017 from the proceeds of our sale of a 48.7% interest in Worldwide Plaza refer to amounts held by the Company and not by ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC. For example, statements such as “our sole remaining property related asset is a 50.1% ownership interest in Worldwide Plaza,” “our interest in Worldwide Plaza,” “our joint venture partner in Worldwide Plaza,” and similar statements refer to ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC’s interests, activities, rights and obligations, and partner with respect to Worldwide Plaza.
 New York REIT Liquidating LLC was formed on November 7, 2018 and is the successor in interest to New York REIT, Inc. (the “Predecessor”). The Predecessor was incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that qualified as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010. On April 15, 2014, the Predecessor listed its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “NYRT.”
The sole purpose of the Company is to wind up the Company’s affairs and the liquidation of the Company’s assets with no objective to continue or to engage in the conduct of a trade or business, except as necessary for the orderly liquidation of the Company’s assets.
Substantially all of the Predecessor’s business was conducted through its operating partnership, New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “OP”).
On August 22, 2016, the Predecessor’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a plan of liquidation to sell in an orderly manner all or substantially all of the assets of the Predecessor and its OP and to liquidate and dissolve the Predecessor and the OP (the “Liquidation Plan”), subject to stockholder approval (see Note 2). The Liquidation Plan was approved at a special meeting of stockholders on January 3, 2017. All of the assets held by the OP have been sold and the OP was dissolved prior to the conversion on November 7, 2018.
At December 31, 2022, the Company’s only significant assets are a 50.1% equity interest in WWP Holdings LLC (“WWP”) which owns one property, aggregating 2.0 million rentable square feet, with an occupancy of 91.0%, and a $90.7 million cash reserve. The Company’s property consists of office space, retail space and a garage, representing 88%, 5% and 7%, respectively, of rentable square feet at December 31, 2022.
Prior to February 28, 2023, the Company sold all of its properties except for the remaining 50.1% interest in Worldwide Plaza. Also, prior to February 28, 2023, the Company, together with the Predecessor, paid aggregate cash liquidating distributions of $1.0 billion, or $61.58 per common share/unit of common membership.
The Company has no employees. Since March 8, 2017, all advisory duties are administered by Winthrop REIT Advisors, LLC (the “Winthrop Advisor”).
Under the Liquidation Plan, the Predecessor was not, and under our limited liability company agreement we are not, permitted to make any new investments except to make protective acquisitions or advances with respect to our existing assets. We are permitted to satisfy any existing contractual obligations and fund required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at our real estate property owned by the joint venture in which we own an interest.
The Liquidation Plan enables us to sell any and all of our assets without further approval of the unitholders and provides that liquidating distributions be made to the unitholders as determined by the Company’s Board of Managers (the “Board of Managers”).

In October 2018, the Predecessor announced the withdrawal of its common stock from listing on the NYSE in connection with the conversion. November 2, 2018 was the last day on which shares of its common stock were traded on the NYSE and our stock

transfer books were closed as of 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on such date. At the effective time of the conversion, each outstanding share of common stock was converted into one unit of common membership interest in the Liquidating LLC (a “Unit”), and holders of shares of the Predecessor’s common stock automatically received one Unit (which Unit was in book entry form) for each share of the common stock held by such stockholder. Unlike shares of the Predecessor’s common stock, which, in addition to being listed on the NYSE, were freely transferable, Units are not listed for trading and generally are not transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. Therefore, the holders of Units do not have the ability to realize any value from these interests except from distributions made by the Company, the timing of which will be solely in the discretion of the Board of Managers.

The Board of Managers was comprised of three members: Randolph C. Read, Craig T. Bouchard and Howard Goldberg. On November 7, 2022, Howard Goldberg resigned from the Board of Managers, effective immediately, pursuant to the terms of the Limited Liability Agreement of the Company. This was not as a result of any disagreement with the operations, policies or practices of the Company. On November 9, 2022, Michael L. Ashner was appointed as a member of the Board of Managers. Since November 9, 2022, the Board of Managers is comprised of Randolph C. Read, Craig T. Bouchard and Michael L. Ashner.

Additionally, John Lee and Joseph Moinian, representing two of the Company’s largest unitholders, served as observers to the Board of Managers from October 4, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, in unpaid positions with no voting rights in connection with Board of Managers matters. On November 8, 2022, John Lee resigned from his position as an observer to the Board of Managers, effective immediately, in accordance with the terms of the previously disclosed Board Observer Agreement between himself and the Company. On November 13, 2022, Joseph Moinian resigned from his position as an observer to the Board of Managers, effective immediately, in accordance with the terms of the previously disclosed Board Observer Agreement between himself and the Company.
 The Company is deemed to be the same entity as the Predecessor with the same assets and liabilities as the Predecessor on the date of conversion. In addition, the charter and bylaws of the Predecessor were replaced by the operating agreement of the Company. For tax purposes, the fair value of each Unit in the Company received by stockholders when the conversion became effective, which reflected the value of the remaining assets of the Company (net of liabilities), was $14.00 per Unit and was equal to the average of the high and low trading prices for shares of the Predecessor’s common stock on the last three days on which the shares were traded on the NYSE.
The business of the Company is the same as the business of the Predecessor immediately preceding the conversion, which, consistent with the Liquidation Plan, consists of the continued ownership of the Predecessor’s interest in Worldwide Plaza, the only remaining property-related asset. Under its operating agreement, the business and affairs of the Company will be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Managers, and the sole purpose is winding up the affairs of the Company and the liquidation of its remaining property-related asset. On March 14, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement of the Company, the Board of Managers extended the term of the Company such that the Company will remain in existence until the earlier of (i) the distribution of all Company assets pursuant to liquidation, or (ii) December 31, 2023. The term may be extended to such later date as the Board of Managers determines is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Company.
The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions to unitholders involves risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the timing or aggregate amount which will be ultimately distributed to unitholders and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Consolidated Statements of Net Assets.
Sales Pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation
Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, excluding the partial sale of Worldwide Plaza, we sold six properties for an aggregate purchase price of $1.325 billion during 2017 and ten properties for an aggregate purchase price of $479.6 million in 2018. There were no property sales during the years 2019-2022.
Assets
Our one remaining property asset is located in New York, New York. See “Properties” in Part I, Item 2 for a description of our remaining asset.

NEW YORK REIT LIQUIDATING LLC
FORM 10-K
DECEMBER 31, 2022


Indebtedness
At December 31, 2022, we indirectly had debt of $601.2 million of unconsolidated mortgage debt reflecting our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza’s total mortgage debt of $1.2 billion, with a weighted average interest rate equal to 3.98% per annum and a weighted average term to maturity of five years.
Tax Status
The Liquidating LLC is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision or benefit for income taxes is made in the consolidated financial statements. Distributions from the Liquidating LLC are not taxable in and of themselves. Unitholders will receive a Schedule K-1 from the Liquidating LLC annually reflecting their allocable share of the Liquidating LLC’s income, loss, gains and deductions.
Competition
The New York City real estate market is highly competitive and there are many competing properties in the New York MSA. With respect to the remaining property asset that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. Many competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do which could limit our success when we compete with them directly. Competition could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses. The manager for leasing activity at our remaining property also manages leasing activity for multiple properties in New York MSA that we do not have an interest in, and we could compete with them for tenants. We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of the Winthrop Advisor for tenants.
Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan we have competition from newly developed as well as existing properties located in the New York City real estate market both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our property. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation.
Regulations
Our investment is subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investment.
Environmental
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on the property in which we hold an interest.
Employees
We have no employees. The employees of the Winthrop Advisor and their affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including accounting, asset management and investor relations services.

We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset dispositions, asset management and other general administrative responsibilities.
Financial Information About Industry Segments
With the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, we have only one reporting segment subsequent to January 3, 2017.
