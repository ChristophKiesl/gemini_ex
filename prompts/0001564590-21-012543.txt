 COVID-19
 Impacts related to the novel coronavirus global pandemic (“COVID-19”) have been significantly negative for the retail industry, our Company, our customers, and our associates. We have experienced significant disruptions to our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related suggested and mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place orders, which initially resulted in the temporary closure of a number of stores and furlough of our associates. During Fiscal 2020, as stores were impacted by negative mall traffic, we focused on our omnichannel capabilities. As of January 30, 2021, the vast majority of our stores had re-opened, although we continue to see residual impacts on foot traffic and in-store revenues.

 AEO Direct
 We sell merchandise through our digital channels, www.ae.com, www.aerie.com, www.toddsnyder.com, and our AEO apps, both domestically and internationally in 81 countries. We also sell merchandise on various international online marketplaces. The digital channels, which we refer to as “AEO Direct” reinforce each particular brand platform and are designed to complement the in-store experience. 
 Over the past several years, we have invested in building our technologies and digital capabilities. We focused our investments in three key areas: making significant advances in mobile technology, investing in digital marketing and improving the digital customer experience.  
 7


Omni-Channel
 In addition to our investments in technology, we have invested in building omni-channel capabilities to better serve customers and gain operational efficiencies. These upgraded technologies provide a single view of inventory across channels, connecting physical stores directly to our digital store and providing our customers with a more convenient and improved shopping experience. Our U.S. and Canadian distribution centers are fully omni-channel and service both stores and digital businesses. We offer the ability for customers to return products seamlessly via any channel regardless of where it was originally purchased.  We also offer a variety of channels to fulfill customer orders.  These include “ship to home”, which can be fulfilled either through our distribution center or our store sites (buy online, ship from stores) when purchased online or through our app; “store pick-up”, which consists of online orders being fulfilled either in store or curbside, and we offer “store-to-door” capability where customers order within our store, and the goods are shipped directly to their home. 
 Customer Loyalty Program
 In June 2020, the Company launched a highly-digitized loyalty program called Real Rewards by American Eagle and Aerie™ (the “Program”). This Program features both new and unique benefits for loyalty members and credit card members.
 Real Rewards by American Eagle and Aerie™ highlights include: 
  
• | Faster earn rates than our previous program, AEO Connected™, which equal more rewards
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exclusive access to member promotions, discounts, and experiences
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Special card member discounts and tier benefits
--+------------------------------------------------

 Under the Program, members accumulate points based on purchase activity and earn rewards by reaching certain point thresholds.  Members earn dollar rewards in the form of discount savings certificates.  Prior to the launch of the Program in June 2020, under our previous program, AEO Connected™, we also offered additional rewards for key items including jeans and bras. Rewards earned are valid through the stated expiration date, which is 60 days from the issuance date of the reward. Rewards not redeemed during the 60-day redemption period are forfeited.
 Merchandise Suppliers
 We design our merchandise, which is manufactured by third-party factories. During Fiscal 2020, we purchased substantially all of our merchandise from non-North American suppliers. We sourced merchandise through approximately 350 vendors located throughout the world, primarily in Asia, and did not source more than 10% of our merchandise from any single factory or supplier. Although we purchase a significant portion of our merchandise through a single international buying agent, we do not maintain any exclusive commitments to purchase from any one vendor.
 We maintain a quality control department at our distribution centers to inspect incoming merchandise shipments for overall quality of manufacturing. Inspections are also made by our employees and agents at manufacturing facilities to identify quality issues prior to shipment of merchandise.
 We uphold an extensive factory inspection program to monitor compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. New garment factories must pass an initial inspection in order to do business with us and we continue to review their performance against our guidelines regarding working conditions, employment practices, and compliance with local laws through internal audits by our compliance team and the use of third-party monitors. We strive to partner with suppliers who respect local laws and share our dedication to utilize best practices in human rights, labor rights, environmental practices, and workplace safety. We are a certified, validated member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program (“CTPAT”), a designation we have held since 2004. CTPAT is a voluntary program offered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) in which an importer agrees to work with CBP to strengthen overall supply chain security. As of September 2016, we were accepted into the Apparel, Footwear, and Textiles Center, one of CBP’s Centers of Excellence and Expertise (“CEE”). The CEEs were created to ensure uniformity, create efficiencies, reduce redundancies, enhance industry expertise, and facilitate trade, all with a final goal of reduced costs at the border and allowing CBP to focus on high-risk shipments.

Inventory and Distribution
 Merchandise is shipped directly from our vendors, deconsolidated through trans loaders to our Company-owned distribution centers in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Ottawa, Kansas, to our third party logistics regional distribution centers or to our Canadian distribution center in Mississauga, Ontario. Additionally, product is shipped directly to stores, which reduces transit times and lowers operating costs. We contract with third-party distribution centers in Mexico and Hong Kong to service our Company-owned stores and e-commerce operations in those regions.
 During Fiscal 2020, we competed inventory optimization initiatives, reflecting reductions in AE, streamlining of assortments, and increasing alignment with sales plans. Aerie inventory increased during the year in line with customer demand.
 Regulation
 We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory authorities. Substantially all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers and imported by us, and we are subject to a variety of trade laws, customs regulations, and international trade agreements. Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies and regulations, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, marketing, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing. We are also subject to regulations governing our employees both globally and in the U.S., and by disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly traded companies established under existing or new federal or state laws, including the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).
 Our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
 Human Capital Management
 Our people come first. As of January 30, 2021, we employed approximately 37,000 associates throughout the world of whom approximately 30,500 were part-time or seasonal associates. We employed 32,000 associates in the U.S, of whom approximately 26,000 were part-time or seasonal associates. 
 
Our values of People, Innovation, Passion, Integrity, and Teamwork are the backbone of our Company and are at the center of every decision, every product and every interaction - they represent the foundation of our REAL culture. We all have a vital role to play in creating an environment where everyone feels respected and empowered while we continue to grow as a community that promotes individuality and difference. We celebrate the diversity of one through the inclusion of many.
 
To evaluate our REAL culture, we look holistically at all the beliefs, values and behaviors that reflect how our best work is done. We aim to ensure there is alignment between what is espoused and what is practiced. Our consistently positive internal employee satisfaction scores, exit survey data, and external Glassdoor ratings demonstrate the achievement of this goal. 
 
Our culture model is comprised of Listening, Observing, Supporting, and Informing:
 
 
• | Listening to our associates, customers and candidates through reviews of culture surveys, exit surveys, Glassdoor reporting, LinkedIn responses, and hotline reporting; we also conduct open door engagement, Company-wide town halls, and roundtables on a periodic basis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Observing who we are and what our associates are doing by studying our demographic data and turnover.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supporting a positive Company culture through programs and processes that promote our strong values and address leadership development opportunities, work-life integration, well-being initiatives, fair pay initiatives, family support, and inclusion and diversity programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Informing and clearly communicating our values, modeling the behaviors we expect, and providing training and feedback.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our Board of Directors (our “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of our talent and culture and devotes time each quarter to receiving updates from senior management on employee engagement, turnover and retention, inclusion and diversity, talent development, leadership, and succession planning initiatives.
 
During Fiscal 2020, we included inclusion and diversity and health and safety objectives in our corporate annual incentive compensation goals, reinforcing the Company’s priorities to protect our people. 
 
TALENT MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
 
We utilize an integrated set of talent management tools and programs, rooted in our values that thread through the entire talent lifecycle. Consistent talent reviews, performance evaluations and succession planning have contributed to a full-time voluntary turnover rate, including our Store associates, of approximately 19% for Fiscal 2020, which is consistent with our retail peer group and compares to a 24% five year AEO average. We also have a full-time promotion rate of approximately 15% for Fiscal 2020. Associate development is supported through numerous programs, including AEO Academy, an online training platform that provides associates with continuous learning opportunities.  Over 1,300 modules gained over 2.7 million views through this platform during Fiscal 2020. 
INCLUSION & DIVERSITY
 
We believe that a truly diverse workplace is a result of an inclusive culture. It is about more than simply bringing together people who are different; it is about celebrating what makes us real.  Our values are at the center of every decision, product, and interaction.  This means making sure that all people are respected and feel that being their authentic selves will not be a barrier to personal or professional fulfillment and growth.
 
We are a global company with people from many different backgrounds.  In the U.S. alone, as of January 30, 2021, approximately 40% of our associates self-identified as a Person of Color (“POC”). Specifically, our U.S. population is approximately 59% White, 23% Hispanic, 9% Black, 4% Asian, 4% two or more races or other, and 1% not reported. Globally, 78% of our associates self-identified as women.  
 

We have three I&D Pillars:
 
 
• | Hiring focuses on increasing the representation of diverse candidates and new hires by developing and executing inclusive recruitment and hiring practices and strategies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Culture focuses on the continued development of an inclusive workplace through the expansion/support of associate groups, promoting educational opportunities, and building awareness around cultural celebrations and community partnerships.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Development focuses on equipping our leaders and our associates with the necessary resources to create and maintain an inclusive workplace while advancing the careers of associates from historically marginalized groups.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During Fiscal 2020, we believe that we made significant strides in inclusion & diversity efforts, including:
 
 
• | Inclusive Leadership and functional Inclusion and Diversity trainings + incorporation of training and educational content into our Learning Management System;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Announcement of the Real Change Scholarship for Social Justice, a $5 million commitment created to advance educational opportunities for full and part-time AEO Inc. associates, who are actively driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Appointment of the Company’s first Chief Inclusion & Diversity Officer;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Appointment of our first Black Board member;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Implementation of a hiring policy designed to increase candidate and new hire diversity; and

HEALTH AND SAFETY
 
11



The health and safety of our workforce and customers is deeply rooted in our culture and business.  Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic was immediate and deliberate. We put our people first and we implemented the following health and safety measures to care for our associates, customers and partners:

• | We instituted industry-leading safety protocols across our operations, including the procurement of masks and PPE for all teams, the hiring of an AEO medical consultant, physical construction to enable social distancing mandates, temperature check stations, installing infrared lighting and air filtration systems in the distribution centers, new breakroom and cafeteria protocols, creating training and videos to explain new safety measures and expectations, and on-site nurses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | During Fiscal 2020, we created the COVID-19 Associate Relief Fund to provide grants to eligible AEO associates who have been adversely impacted by COVID-19; distributed AEO Foundation grants to non-profits in local communities; and donated over $1 million nationally to COVID-19 relief efforts, including donating gift cards and more than one million masks to front-line workers in cities most in need.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Competition
 The global retail apparel industry is highly competitive both in stores and online. We compete with various local, national, and global apparel retailers, as well as the casual apparel and footwear departments of department stores and discount retailers, primarily on the basis of quality, fashion, service, selection, and price.
Trademarks and Service Marks
 We have registered AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS®, AMERICAN EAGLE®, AE®, AEO®, LIVE YOUR LIFE®, AERIE®, and the Flying Eagle Design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also have registered or have applied to register substantially all of these trademarks with the registries of the foreign countries in which our stores and/or manufacturers are located and/or where our product is shipped. 
 We have registered AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS®, AMERICAN EAGLE®, AEO®, LIVE YOUR LIFE®, AERIE®, and the Flying Eagle Design with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.

 Seasonality
 Historically, our operations have been seasonal, with a large portion of total net revenue and operating income occurring in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, reflecting increased demand during the back-to-school and year-end holiday selling seasons, respectively. Our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, the acceptability of seasonal merchandise offerings, the timing and level of markdowns, store closings and remodels, competitive factors, weather and general economic and political conditions.  During Fiscal 2020, historic seasonal trends were impacted by consumer behavior due to COVID-19.
