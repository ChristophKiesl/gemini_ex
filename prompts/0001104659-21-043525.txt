ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction
 
Edify Acquisition Corp. (“EAC”) a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on September 30, 2020 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination or our business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we intend to focus our search on businesses in education, edtech, workforce development, and HCM sectors in the United States.
 
On January 20, 2021, EAC consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 27,600,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of one share of common stock of EAC, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The closing included the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to EAC of $276,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, EAC consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with the Sponsor of 5,640,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $5,640,000. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants (as defined below) sold in the IPO except that the Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the Sponsor, the anchor investors or their permitted transferees. Additionally, our Sponsor and anchor investors have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the date that is 30 days after the date we complete our initial business combination. Our Sponsor and anchor investors were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Warrants.
 
As of January 20, 2021, a total of $276,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders at Morgan Stanley maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to (i) pay our tax obligations or (ii) for working capital purposes (but not to exceed $250,000 annually) (less up to $100,000 interest to pay dissolution expenses), the amounts in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by January 21, 2023 or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by January 21, 2023, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
 
Colbeck Edify Holdings, LLC
 
We are sponsored by Colbeck Edify Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of Colbeck Capital Management, LLC (“Colbeck”), a leading middle-market private equity asset manager focused on strategic lending. Founded in 2009, Colbeck partners with companies during periods of transition, providing creative and highly structured capital solutions to meet their evolving needs. Due to the complex nature of its investments, Colbeck’s diligence and portfolio management is similar to that of traditional private equity firms. Its diligence processes regularly include third-party market studies, accounting and legal analysis, internally generated financial modeling and forecasting, and extensive on-site and management diligence. Colbeck supports its portfolio companies through consistent engagement with management in areas such as financial management, budgeting, governance, executive management, acquisition strategy, deal execution and capital markets activity, generating incremental returns for active sponsorship. Colbeck’s principals have participated in over $22 billion of strategic investments over 70 combined years and across market cycles at leading institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Macquarie.

In addition to managing capital from leading institutional endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and public and corporate pensions, the principals at Colbeck are founders of a fully-integrated education services provider, Studio Enterprise, LLC (“Studio”), that uses technology, human resources, and data to help top colleges and universities transform in the digital era. In addition to Studio, described further below, Colbeck has experience with other relevant investments including Rimini Street, Limbach, and TechStyle Fashion Group.
 
With our capability to source, execute, and manage assets across various sectors and our education-specific operating and investing experience, we believe we are well-positioned to drive ongoing value creation post-business combination within our targeted sector.
 
Studio Enterprise, LLC
 
The principals at Colbeck founded the predecessor company to Studio Enterprise, LLC (“Studio”) in 2013 to support the innovation, reinvention, and advancement of mission in higher education. Studio was launched as a fully integrated education services provider that offers critical services to partner institutions. As the founding team and sole control equity sponsor, the principals of Colbeck have grown Studio from a start-up to a leading education services provider in seven years. Today, Studio provides services including marketing and admissions, compliance, finance and accounting, financial aid intake, information technology, facilities management, and curriculum and instructional design to over 14,000 students across 19 campus locations and across 65 degree programs, ranging from certificate to doctoral, supporting institutions of various sizes with both online and on-ground modalities.
 
Given Studio’s history and with experience managing both organic growth and expansion through acquisitions in the sector, the management team believes we are well equipped to analyze and find an attractive investment opportunity in the learning and talent management industry. Post-acquisition, the team believes it is capable and comfortable with sponsoring a company within these industries given its precedent experience.
 
Our Management Team and Board of Directors
 
We are led by Susan Wolford, our Chairwoman, Peter Ma, our Chief Executive Officer, and Morris Beyda, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we assembled a team of industry experts with executive and operational experience at education, edtech, or HCM companies, who will serve on our Board of Directors. Together, the team combines for over 150 years of experience as investors, advisors, and operators with over 100 years focused in the target sectors.

For the past 20 years, she has been focused on the educational services industry, working with pre-K-12, post-secondary, and lifelong learning companies. During her tenure leading the education practice at BMO Capital Markets, which started when Ms. Wolford joined the bank in April 2003, Ms. Wolford sourced and executed 52 merger and acquisition transactions and was involved in over $37 billion in debt and equity financings.

Industry Opportunity
 
While we may acquire a business in any industry or geographic location, our focus will be on the learning and talent management industry, which includes the education, edtech, workforce development, and HCM sectors. We believe our focus industry is attractive for several reasons:

· | Expansive Universe of Potential Targets: We intend to focus our investment effort broadly across the education, edtech, workforce development, and HCM sectors. We believe that our investment and operating expertise in education, specifically in the higher education sector, will give us a large, addressable universe of potential targets. Additionally, the management team has had significant exposure to many potential investment opportunities from their experience as both operators and investors in the industry. The diversity of the target universe and the number of sub-sectors maximizes the likelihood that the management team will be able to identify and execute an attractive transaction. We believe that there are over 90 target companies within Edify’s focus industries and that the universe of scaled learning and talent management assets has increased dramatically in the last decade. We believe, that within these sectors, public markets valuation multiples have been consistently increasing achieving levels that generally exceed historical private market valuations. The potential target universe includes the following:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Education and Edtech: PreK-12 and higher education operators, content and assessments, tutoring and test preparation, administrative software platforms, classroom and content delivery software platforms, and services
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Workforce Development: Consumer and corporate paid training and skills development aimed at increasing personal and enterprise wide productivity
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | HCM: HR software and services intended to improve the productivity of employee acquisition, retention, and effectiveness
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Significant Total Addressable Market (“TAM”) With Robust Private Sector Growth:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Education, Edtech, and Workforce Development: The global education market, including PreK-12, higher education, and corporate training, was roughly $5.9 trillion in 2019 ($5.4 trillion estimated for 2020) and expected to grow at a 3.6% CAGR to $7.3 trillion by 2025. Spending on education technology is expected to grow even faster and is accelerating as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, educational consulting and research firm HolonIQ increased its market size and growth estimates for the global edtech market to reflect the impact of the pandemic, projecting spending to increase at a 16.3% CAGR from $163 billion in 2019 to $404 billion in 2025 ($227 million estimated for 2020). Projected digital spend as a percentage of total global expenditures is projected to increase as well, from 2.7% in 2019 to 5.2% in 2025. Although the entire industry may be vast, the private sector portion is still relatively small. The past two decades have seen the birth of the K-12 alternative school movement, the explosion (and then contraction) of the private postsecondary sector, and the creation of the online learning sector. In just the U.S., we estimate that the private sector education will generate roughly $123 billion in revenues in 2020, or about 7.8% of the overall education market. Private sector education revenues are expected to grow significantly faster that the overall market, reaching roughly $149 billion in 2025, still only comprising about 8.4% of total education spending.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | HCM: According to Gartner, the global HCM application market generated roughly $18.5 billion in revenue in 2019 ($18.3 billion estimated for 2020) and is estimated to reach $25.9 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 7.0% CAGR. The role of HCM has become more strategic to employers as they address a more mobile and remote workforce, tightening labor markets, and a growing skills gap (discussed above) and seek to optimize their investments in attracting, managing, and developing talent. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic can accelerate growth in the sector as employers look to a more flexible work environment. According to a Paychex survey from June 2020, 55% of small and medium sized businesses plan to allow or require employees to work remotely, and 41% see more flexible work schedules as a permanent change to the work environment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acceleration of Online and Blended Learning: Online education is rapidly gaining acceptance among students, schools, and employers, as a valuable and effective mode of education delivery. COVID-19 has accelerated technological exposure and adoption in education for both students and parents. Global Market Insights estimates that the online learning market, encompassing online learning, learning management system (LMS), mobile learning, rapid online learning, and virtual classroom technology, surpassed $200 billion in 2019 and is anticipated to grow at over 8% CAGR between 2020 and 2026. Drivers for this estimated growth include a rise in the number of Internet users and new technologies such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which are increasingly impacting education. While we believe there are attractive investment opportunities that are not online learning focused, we see this trend as transformative and a driver of value for the broader education and edtech industries. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus on Affordability Will Require Innovation: According to the College Board, the cost of higher education has increased significantly between the 1989-1990 and 2019-2020 academic years, with total student costs (tuition, room, and board) rising 2.2% compounded annually on an inflation-adjusted basis at private non-profit four-year institutions and 2.7% at public four-year institutions. A survey of online student preferences conducted by Learning House in June of 2019, demonstrates that cost has remained the top factor in the online college student’s decision-making process since 2015, with 60% of undergraduates selecting affordability as a top three factor in 2019. The significant and unsustainable growth of tuition rates has resulted in higher education becoming unaffordable for many potential students. This presents opportunities to enable schools to become more efficient through the use of administrative software, technology in classrooms to lower the cost of instruction, and software to increase student retention and graduation. This theme of affordability has also spawned non-degree training for entry level positions such as coding schools and other certification businesses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Opportunity for Educators to Leverage Technology to Unlock Efficiencies: Online learning has not only widened the learner base, but also necessitated the need to invest in technology required to teach both students and perform administrative functions. According to Gartner, software IT spending on K-12 and higher education in the United States is projected to increase from approximately $10.2 billion in 2020 to approximately $17.8 billion in 2024, representing a 14.9% CAGR. The sale of strategic ancillary solutions in the United States represents a significant growth opportunity as academic institutions become more sophisticated in using software and data to support business processes and driving strategic decisions. This is reinforced by the fact that budget pressures and shifting economic conditions also prompt institutions to seek ways to more efficiently manage their operations using technology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Increased Investment in Workforce Development and a Focus on Reskilling or Upskilling: Over the last three decades, technological innovation, such as automation, digitization, and globalization, have transformed the landscape of the United States’ workforce. According to a 2019 McKinsey Global Institute report on the impact of digitization on the U.S. economy, the speed of technology-induced skill displacement is projected to double over the next decade, displacing nearly 14.7 million workers under the age of 34, as well as 11.5 million workers over the age of 50. A 2016 Pew Research Center survey, “The State of American Jobs,” found that 87% of workers believe it will be important or essential for them to obtain, training, and develop new job skills throughout their careers in order to keep up with changes in the workplace.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experience is the Best Teacher: Despite its substantial size, the education and edtech industries can be considered niche and often involve understanding of players, payors, and policy. The management team brings with it a significant history of operating and investing in higher education and is well versed in understanding the relevant nuances. We believe this positions Edify Acquisition Corp. well and maximizes the likelihood that the management team successfully identifies, acquires, and operates a company in the education or edtech industry. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Strategy
 
We believe the learning and talent management industry provides a large and growing marketplace with favorable macro trends and will provide an expansive universe of potential targets. Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that is well-positioned strategically to take advantage of the growth, consolidation, and disruption opportunities available in the education, edtech, workforce development, and HCM sectors, in order to build long-term stockholder value. We believe that many of our target opportunities may fall into one of the following categories: a) assets that cannot be levered and as such a public valuation may be more compelling than a leveraged buyout; b) high quality but undermanaged assets where our experienced board of directors can add substantial operational value; c) multiple arbitrage opportunities where multiples in the public market can be substantially higher than those in the private market; d) scaled assets that are becoming too large for the majority of financial sponsors, limiting the universe of private equity buyers. We believe our management team, with the assistance of our advisors, is well-positioned to identify unique opportunities within the learning and talent management and related industries. Certain members of our founders, management team and board of directors spent several years working with, transacting with, and investing in businesses in the education and HCM sectors and have developed a wide network of professional services contacts and business relationships. Our selection process will leverage our relationships with key learning and talent management providers, venture capitalists, growth equity, and private equity funds, executives of private and public companies, investment banking firms, lenders, restructuring advisers, attorneys, accountants, consultants, charitable organizations, and other intermediaries and service providers, which we believe should provide us with a key competitive advantage in sourcing potential business combination targets and ultimately will seek to provide prospective sellers with comfort that the process is well-informed and targeted. Given our profile and dedicated industry approach, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources and investors in other private and public companies in our networks. Our management team will also proactively search for unique opportunities that are best positioned for our initial business combination. We believe that our management team and advisors’ reputations, experience, and track record of making investments in the learning and talent management industry will make us a preferred partner for these potential targets.
Business Combination Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective business combination opportunities. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:

· | Are companies in the education, edtech, workforce development, and HCM sectors with attractive brand and history of business success;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have an estimated enterprise value of at least $500mm
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
7

 



· | have differentiated products or value propositions that provide growth opportunities and competitive advantages;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have a strong and experienced management team with a track record of growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have a history of strong operating and financial results or provide a clear path to achieving profitability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | operate in geographies with low political and economic risk;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | are prepared to be a public company and want to have public currency for acquisitions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | offer an attractive risk-adjusted return to our stockholders;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | have strong corporate governance and reporting policies in place;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | will benefit as a public company from increased public market valuations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria and guidelines are not expected to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that from time to time our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination.
 
Management Operating and Investment Experience
 
We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination.
 
As more fully discussed in “Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
8

 

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
