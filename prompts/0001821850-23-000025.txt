Item 1. Business
Overview
Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. (“Sunlight” or the “Company”) is a business-to-business-to-consumer, technology-enabled point-of-sale (“POS”) financing platform that provides residential solar and home improvement contractors the ability to offer seamless POS financing to their customers when purchasing residential solar systems or other home improvements. The resulting loans are funded by Sunlight’s capital providers. These loans are facilitated by Sunlight’s proprietary technology platform, Orange® (“Orange®” or the “Platform”), through which Sunlight offers instant credit decisions to homeowners nationwide at the POS on behalf of Sunlight’s capital providers. Since Sunlight’s founding in 2014 through December 31, 2022, Sunlight has facilitated over $9.0 billion of loans through the Platform in partnership with its contractor relationships.
To date, Sunlight has facilitated loans to more than 219,130 homeowners. As of December 31, 2022, residential solar systems and energy-efficient home improvement products, facilitated through Sunlight financings since May 2016, have prevented the emission of an estimated 37.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Sunlight has also executed the United Nations Climate Neutral Now Pledge, and its business was certified as carbon neutral for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 and is in the process of performing the required review to obtain certification for its fiscal year 2022. 
Sunlight’s core business is facilitating loans made by Sunlight’s capital providers to the consumer customers of residential solar contractors. Sales of Sunlight-facilitated loan products are made by contractors in the context of selling residential solar systems to consumers, allowing homeowners to go solar with no money down. While only approximately 20% of residential solar system sales were financed with solar loans in 2015, an estimated 75% of residential solar loan sales were financed with solar loans in 2022. Solar loans made to finance residential solar systems through Sunlight’s Platform are made exclusively to homeowners. As of December 31, 2022, the average FICO score of all solar borrowers financed through Sunlight’s Platform is 748. 
Loan providers in the residential solar industry compete primarily on process (customer and contractor experience), pricing, and products. Orange® offers contractors robust tools to sell more solar systems and home improvements and homeowners a fast, fully-digital, and frictionless experience. 
Sunlight’s Technology-Enabled POS Financing Platform and Loan Facilitation
Sunlight’s revenue is primarily from platform fees earned on each solar and home improvement loan facilitated through Orange®. The platform fee is generally equal to the margin between the contractor fee charged to the contractor by Sunlight for each loan facilitated through Orange® and the discount at which Sunlight’s capital provider either funds or purchases such loan (as described in more detail below). Sunlight does not earn material revenue from loans maintained on its balance sheet.
Relationships with Contractors
Sunlight’s network of residential solar system installers and other home improvement contractors, supported by a differentiated set of tools and services offered through Orange®, constitutes the distribution channel through which Sunlight builds funded loan volume and earns platform fees. 
Relationships with Capital Providers
Sunlight’s business model is dependent on its ability to connect its capital providers, who wish to build a portfolio of residential solar system or other home improvement loans, to the homeowner customers of the contractors in Sunlight’s distribution network, who wish to finance the purchase of a residential solar system or other home improvements. Sunlight earns a platform fee on each solar and home improvement loan facilitated through Orange®. The platform fee is generally equal to the difference, or the margin, between (i) the dealer fee that Sunlight charges to contractors for access to Orange® and for making the various Sunlight-offered loan products available to such contractors and (ii) the capital provider discount charged by the capital provider either funding or purchasing the loan in the direct and indirect channels, respectively (as described below). Sunlight’s business is therefore heavily dependent upon the availability of capital on attractive economic terms. 
Sunlight categorizes its capital providers as being either in Sunlight’s direct or indirect channel. Sunlight maintains both channels to provide diversification of funding sources, access to funding for different types of loan products and for other strategic purposes. The ability of Sunlight to allocate loans to various capital providers, as well as the availability of the two different funding channels, creates flexibility and allows Sunlight to respond to shifting market conditions.
Direct channel capital providers fund Sunlight-facilitated solar or home improvement loans one-by-one directly onto their balance sheet via Orange®. Sunlight’s direct channel capital providers are depository institutions with the power and authority to originate loans such as banks and credit unions. Generally, direct channel capital providers choose to service the loans they originate. Sunlight currently has approximately one direct capital provider.
In the indirect channel, Sunlight’s allocation engine directs that certain solar and home improvement loans be funded on the balance sheet of Sunlight’s intermediary bank partner, Cross River Bank (“Bank Partner”) under the terms of loan agreements with the Bank Partner (the “Bank Partner Agreements”). These loans are aggregated, pooled and sold to indirect channel capital providers that cannot, or do not wish to, directly originate solar loans. The indirect channel capital provider relationship allows Sunlight to access a broader range of capital, which may include, among others, credit funds, insurance companies and pension funds. Indirect channel capital providers present a unique opportunity for Sunlight to access high quality and significant sources of funding that are diverse from traditional depository sources. Bank Partner is Sunlight’s only indirect channel provider.

Sunlight’s Products
Sunlight-Facilitated Solar Loans. Sunlight facilitates a broad range of solar loan products, varying as to structure, tenor and interest rate, which are focused on differing contractor and consumer objectives and market dictates. Sunlight facilitates solar loan products structured to support the financing of residential solar systems as well as to meet other homeowner demands such as loans to:
•finance the acquisition of a solar battery to be retrofit to an existing homeowner solar system;
•provide financing for a residential solar system plus a new roof in the same loan as is often required to support the addition of the solar panels;
•finance solar in addition to other forms of home improvement projects; and
•finance solar roof products (solar roof tiles).
Sunlight’s solar loan products are secured and fixed rate, closed-end term loans. Specific terms are developed to address homeowner financing needs, amongst other factors as discussed below, and include tenors between 5 and 25 years with interest rates per annum ranging from 1.99% to 9.99%. Not all tenors are offered at each available interest rate and not all solar loan structures are offered at all tenors. For a solar loan, minimum principal amounts are generally $10,000 and maximum principal amounts are $150,000, all subject to qualification requirements.
Sunlight-Facilitated Home Improvement Loans. Home improvement loans facilitated by Sunlight through Orange® are unsecured, closed-end term loans. The structures applicable to loan products in the home improvement space tend to be more varied. Consumer demand includes payment structures that include delays in the start of payment obligations, periods of interest only payments, periods of principal only payments as well as straight-line amortizing fixed rate loans. Sunlight has developed a full range of loan products including different tenors that range from 3 to 15 years. Home improvement loans are often significantly smaller than solar loans with a minimum loan balance of $500 but can also be as large as $100,000. During the year ended December 31, 2022, interest rates on Sunlight-facilitated home improvement loan products ranged up to 11.99%. Similar to Sunlight-facilitated solar loans, Sunlight-facilitated home improvement loans offered through Orange® are determined by consumer demand, terms requested by Sunlight’s contractors (which may also be driven by the dealer fee charged to a contractor for a given loan product), availability of attractively-priced funding from Sunlight’s capital providers, the attractiveness of a given loan product measured by the production of related loan volume, the interest rate environment and other market factors and the regulatory and risk management concerns of Sunlight and its capital providers amongst other considerations. Sunlight home improvement loan products made up 15.2% of Sunlight’s funded loans and less than 5.0% of its revenue in fiscal year 2022.
Seasonality
The residential solar and home improvement markets are subject to seasonality primarily related to weather and other industry factors, which typically causes fluctuations in Sunlight’s operating results and can cause Sunlight’s future performance to be difficult to predict. Sunlight has experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past and expects 
to experience such fluctuations in the future. Sunlight’s contractors generally experience higher sales in the second and third quarters of each year. Given the timeline between a solar system or home improvement sale and when a loan to finance such project is funded, this generally results in higher funded volumes for Sunlight, on a relative basis, in the third and fourth quarters of each year, however, Sunlight believes that the increasing impacts of climate change could make the seasonality in Sunlight’s business less predictable. Sunlight further believes that the seasonality in credit applications and funded volume that it experiences in its business is consistent with others that compete in the same markets.
Interest Rates
Sunlight’s business is significantly impacted by interest rates and the associated market for the sale of Indirect Channel Loans (as defined below). Interest rates rose rapidly during 2022, which impacted the pricing in the market for the sale of Indirect Channel Loans causing us to incur significant losses associated with the sale of Indirect Channel Loans because of the interest rate gap between the time the underlying Indirect Channel Loans were processed at a lower rate to a later time when Sunlight was able to monetize the Indirect Channel Loans after the interest rates increased. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, Sunlight recognized $22.7 million in negative platform fees in connection with indirect loan sales. While subject to significant uncertainty, Sunlight may incur negative platform fees between $45.0 million and $55.0 million in connection with a portfolio of funded but unsold loans the Bank Partner held at March 31, 2023, pursuant to loan agreements with the Bank Partner, a significant portion of which were credit approved prior to certain pricing actions that Sunlight took in the third and fourth quarters (such loans, “Backbook Loans”).
Competition
Competition for Sunlight occurs at two levels: (i) competition to acquire and maintain contractor relationships; and (ii) competition to acquire high quality capital to fund loans, in each case on economic terms favorable to Sunlight.
Competition to obtain contractor relationships is significant. Contractors generally do not enter exclusive relationships with residential solar loan providers and Sunlight’s agreements with its network of contractors generally do not provide for exclusive relationships. 
In addition, the solar system and home improvement loan markets are relatively fragmented. Facilitating the aggregation of loan volume from these markets is a highly competitive sector of these broader industries. Sunlight faces competition from a diverse landscape of consumer lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions, and specialized solar system lenders and lease providers. Sunlight’s competitors source capital from a mix of alternative sources, including depository capital and/or other alternatives that rely on the capital markets.
Intellectual Property
Sunlight seeks to protect its intellectual property by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the United States, as well as on contractual measures. Sunlight protects its trademarks throughout the United States by making applicable trademark filings and further protects its trademarks and trade secrets via contractual provisions clearly establishing rights of use and Sunlight’s ability to terminate those rights, robust confidentiality provisions and other similar agreements. Sunlight also places appropriate restrictions on its proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures, a key part of its broader risk management strategy.
Sunlight currently maintains 12 trademarks and has one pending application for registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office including, among others, registration of its name, “Sunlight Financial,” “Orange®,” Sunlight’s logo and other trade names for loan products or innovations developed and offered by Sunlight. 
Regulation
Sunlight’s operations are subject to regulation and supervision in a number of jurisdictions. The level of regulation and supervision to which Sunlight is subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. Sunlight, in conjunction with outside advisors and counsel, seeks to manage its business and operations in compliance with such regulation and supervision. The regulatory and legal requirements that apply to Sunlight’s activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more restrictive, which may make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restrict Sunlight’s ability to conduct its business activities in the manner in which they are now conducted. Changes in applicable regulatory and legal requirements, including changes in their enforcement or interpretation, could cause Sunlight to lose the ability to operate in certain states or result in Sunlight needing to apply for licensure in certain states, which could materially and adversely affect Sunlight’s business and its financial condition and results of operations.
Employees and Human Capital Management
At December 31, 2022, Sunlight employed 233 employees, including 232 full-time employees, in its Charlotte, North Carolina and New York, New York offices as compared to 216 employees, including 214 full-time employees, at December 31, 2021.
Business Combination
On July 9, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Sunlight consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), dated as of January 23, 2021, by and among Spartan Acquisition Corp. II (“Spartan”), Sunlight Financial LLC and the Spartan Subsidiaries, FTV Blocker and Tiger Blocker (each as defined in the Business Combination Agreement). On the Closing Date, Spartan changed its name to “Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc.” and Sunlight Financial LLC became the operating subsidiary of Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc., organized in an “Up-C” structure (the “Business Combination”).
For the periods prior to the Business Combination, Sunlight presents the results of operations for Sunlight Financial LLC and its consolidated subsidiary (the “Predecessor”), which does not include the results of operations for Spartan. For the periods after the Business Combination, Sunlight presents the results of operations for Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Sunlight Financial LLC, (the “Successor”). The year ended December 31, 2021 (the “Combined Annual Period”) includes the results of operations for the Successor during the period of July 10, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (the “Successor Period”) and the results of operation for the Predecessor during the period January 1, 2021 through July 9, 2021 (the “Predecessor Annual Period”).
Strategic Investment Alternatives
As previously announced on November 14, 2022, Sunlight, with the assistance of its advisors and under the supervision of an Independent Committee of the Board of Directors, began to review strategic alternatives and explore available options for Sunlight, including selling Sunlight, raising additional capital (equity or debt) to finance its operations, implementing cost saving measures to preserve cash or a restructuring of Sunlight through a privately negotiated transaction or a court process. Sunlight has received interest from parties both in investing in Sunlight and in acquiring Sunlight.
On April 2, 2023 Sunlight Financial LLC, Sunlight and the Bank Partner, entered the Commitment and Transaction Support Agreement (Commitment & Transaction Support Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties have agreed to undertake the transactions (“Transactions”) described in the Commitment & Transaction Support Agreement, including, amendments to the Bank Partner Agreements, entry into a new secured term loan facility with the Bank Partner, and issuance of equity warrants entitling the Bank Partner or its designees to purchase shares of Sunlight’s Class A common stock. 
Effective April 25, 2023, Sunlight, Sunlight LLC, and other subsidiary entities, as applicable, closed the Transactions contemplated by the Commitment & Transaction Support Agreement and entered into a Secured Term Loan with the Bank Partner (“Secured Term Loan”), amended and restated Bank Partner Agreements (the “Amended Bank Partner Agreements”), a Warrant Purchase Agreement with CRB Group, Inc. (the “Purchaser”), an affiliate of the Bank Partner (the “Warrant Purchase Agreement”) and issued the associated warrant to purchase shares of Sunlight’s Class A common stock (the “Warrant”) to the Purchaser. See additional information and details regarding the Transactions in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments and Outlook. These transactions align with the goals of the strategic alternatives process and the Board is continuing to review additional actions to maximize value for shareholders.
