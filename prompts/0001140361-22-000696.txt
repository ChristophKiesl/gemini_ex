Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on July 31, 2019 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Form 10-K as our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
 
On November 26, 2019, we consummated an initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 30,000,000 units (the “Units”) at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, which included the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,500,000 Units, generating gross proceeds to us of $300,000,000.
 Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated a private placement with CHP Acquisition Holdings LLC (our “Sponsor”) of 8,000,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant (the “Private Placement”).
 
Following the closing of the initial public offering, an amount of $300,000,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders and the underwriters of the initial public offering, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal from interest earned on the funds in the trust account to fund franchise and income taxes payable, or upon the redemption by public stockholders of Class A common stock in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the completion of the Company’s initial business combination and the redemption of 100% of the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units and issued by the Company in the initial public offering if the Company is unable to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering.
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we intend to focus on the industries that complement our team’s background, and to capitalize on the ability of our team to identify and acquire a business, focusing on the healthcare or healthcare related industries in the United States.
 Our strategy will be to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a healthcare or healthcare related business. We intend to focus our investment effort broadly across the entire healthcare industry with an emphasis on healthcare services, healthcare information technology, supply chain management, medical technology, medical devices and diagnostics.
 
Our sponsor is an affiliate of Concord Health Partners, LLC, or Concord, a healthcare investment firm. We believe the experience of our team and broad network of strategic relationships with healthcare companies will allow us to source, identify and execute an attractive transaction for our stockholders.
 Concord is a healthcare focused investment firm with a strategic model that optimizes the alignment of interests between investors and portfolio companies. Concord is primarily focused on investing in healthcare companies that have the potential to enhance the value of care through products, services, technologies and solutions that lower costs, improve quality of care delivery and service and/or expand access to care. Concord has completed five investments to date (VitalTech Holdings, Inc., MIVI Neuroscience, Inc., Flexwise Health, Inc., Proton Therapy Partners, Inc. and Mednition, Inc.).
 
To date, Concord has invested in early stage, private healthcare companies within the firm’s AHA Innovation Development Fund. The AHA Innovation Development Fund was formed in association with the American Hospital Association, the national organization that represents nearly 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, networks, and other providers of care, to provide an investment vehicle through which AHA Members can make strategic investments in early-stage healthcare companies - in a manner consistent with the AHA’s mission, vision, and values. Concord targets companies that can scale efficiently through commercial and strategic relationships with AHA members. By leveraging its investor base and its relationship with the AHA, Concord aims to create incremental value by accelerating business development and shortening sales cycles to drive growth at portfolio companies.

In addition to public capital markets and private equity investing experience, Concord has an operating team that provides varying levels of support to Concord’s portfolio companies. The operating team’s capabilities complement Concord’s private transactions group which custom designs transactions to accommodate long-term structured investments in healthcare companies. Concord also benefits from its strategic partnership model in which interests are aligned between strategic investors and portfolio companies. Concord’s strategic partners expand access to opportunities and provide supplemental resources to Concord and its portfolio companies. The model allows Concord to accelerate business development and drive efficient growth to create incremental value for all stakeholders. Select strategic investors include the American Hospital Association, Atlantic Health System, Atrium Health, Blanchard Valley, Carilion Clinic, Edward-Elmhurst Health, Hartford Healthcare, Henry Ford Health System, Ochsner, Saint Luke’s Health System, Cox Health and Mercy Health Services. We believe that we will benefit from Concord’s diverse resources and capabilities.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We intend to capitalize on the following competitive advantages in our pursuit of a target company:
 
Extensive Network Across Healthcare. Our team believes that its reputation, deep experience and proactive approach to sourcing transactions, and extensive industry relationships will provide numerous investment opportunities. Our Chairman, Joseph Swedish, and our Chief Executive Officer, James Olsen possess deep industry expertise across numerous parts of the healthcare spectrum, which makes them compelling partners for healthcare companies seeking capital solutions. Moreover, Concord has developed a proprietary model for collaboration and cooperation with its strategic partners and investors that allows it to efficiently engage supplemental resources and expertise to support investment activities. Concord’s Strategic Resource Group consists of C-Suite Executives and clinical staff members from healthcare organizations that represent Concord’s limited partners. Concord also has an extensive group of senior advisors who are key thought leaders and accomplished executives in the industry. Given Mr. Swedish’s and Mr. Olsen’s long track records and reputations in the healthcare sector, as well as their broad and diverse network, there will be significant potential for them to source new opportunities that may not be broadly marketed.
Broad Experience Across Numerous Public and Private Healthcare Companies. Our team has broad experience working with both public and private companies, for-profit health care companies and not-for-profit health systems. Mr. Swedish has more than 45 years of experience in healthcare services, health insurance and related industries and has been a CEO for both public and private healthcare companies for over 25 years. Since stepping down from Anthem as CEO in May 2018, Mr. Swedish has remained an advisor to Anthem and continues to have multiple board engagements. Mr. Swedish has led numerous M&A transactions throughout his career and has demonstrated an ability to drive growth and create value. Mr. Swedish successfully led multiple organizations through significant growth phases and navigated through numerous turnaround situations that required extensive merger and acquisition activity to execute on key objectives. While CEO, Mr. Swedish helped drive Anthem’s growth by leading the company through numerous acquisitions and divestitures, including two meaningful acquisitions of Medicare Advantage businesses that further established Anthem’s national presence. During Mr. Swedish’s tenure, Anthem’s membership grew by four million, or 11%, and operating revenue increased 39% to over $89 billion. These successes are illustrated by Anthem’s average share price which nearly quadrupled from approximately $60 per share to $250 per share during Mr. Swedish’s five-year tenure at Anthem. As CEO of Trinity Health, Mr. Swedish led the merger of Trinity and Catholic Health East and executed numerous large-scale health system mergers resulting in one of the largest healthcare delivery systems in the U.S. across 22 states. Trinity Health created the nation’s largest home care and nursing organization during Mr. Swedish’s time as CEO. While he was CEO of Trinity Health, Mr. Swedish assisted in the creation of and served on the board of the Heritage Healthcare Innovation Fund, a private equity fund managed by the Heritage Group. Additionally, Mr. Swedish oversaw numerous syndicated joint ventures with ambulatory surgery centers as well as the acquisition of several physician practices. Mr. Olsen has more than 24 years of experience in healthcare investment banking and advisory services. While in investment banking, Mr. Olsen executed multiple billions of dollars worth of transactions across mergers & acquisitions and capital markets. We believe that this versatility of experience and understanding of both public and private markets will allow us to identify companies that could make successful public market candidates and prepare them to make the transition to strong publicly-traded companies.

Proven Ability to Innovate in Rapidly Changing Healthcare Landscape. Our team has extensive knowledge of a broad scope of healthcare companies and direct experience leading and advising such organizations to strategically position them for success in an ever-changing healthcare landscape. We believe this experience will enable us to successfully source and structure potential deals as well as ultimately drive growth and create value through continued innovation, partnerships and relationships, among other growth factors.
Execution and Structuring Expertise for Complex Transactions. Our team believes that its industry expertise, execution experience and reputation allow them to source and complete transactions with structural attributes that create an attractive investment thesis. These types of transactions may be complex and require creative structuring, industry knowledge and expertise, rigorous due diligence, and extensive negotiation and documentation. In addition, complexity associated with healthcare payment mechanics are well understood by the management team and provide for a broader opportunity set. We believe that by focusing our investment activities on these types of transactions, we may be able to generate investment opportunities that have attractive risk/reward profiles based on their valuations and structural characteristics.
Significant Value-Add Capability. Our team and Concord’s sector expertise and broad network of relationships can add significant value after consummation of a transaction. We anticipate that our team will be involved with a target company in a number of capacities, including: (i) assisting in setting strategic direction and priorities; (ii) designing specific performance improvement projects; (iii) helping to identify and recruit senior leaders and Board members; (iv) advising on acquisition and financing transactions and the integration thereafter; (v) contributing market information; and (vi) developing a targeted investor relations program. Furthermore, our team is also experienced in directly navigating complex reimbursement and regulatory issues that many companies in healthcare have to manage over time. We believe that our management team’s ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives for companies that they have led has been an essential driver of past performance and may be central to its acquisition strategy.
Industry Opportunity
 
While we may acquire a business in any industry, we intend to focus on industries that complement our team’s background and to capitalize on the ability of our team to identify and acquire a business, focusing on the healthcare or healthcare related industries in the United States. We believe the healthcare industry is attractive for a number of reasons:
Large and Growing Market Opportunity. The healthcare industry represents a massive market opportunity. Total U.S. national health expenditure exceeded $3.5 trillion in 2018, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has estimated that total healthcare spending will approach 20-25% of total U.S. Gross Domestic Product over the coming years. As of August 2019, the number of private companies in the healthcare industry is significant, with over 55,000 operating companies focused on various sub-sectors of the healthcare services continuum in the U.S. alone.
Favorable Macro Trends. Total global healthcare expenditure has continued to grow recently at a pace substantially above the rate of inflation, and this growth is projected to continue, spurred by an aging population, increased prevalence of chronic disease, and improved access to healthcare. While the magnitude of healthcare spending continues to grow, this expense has put significant pressure on public, private, and individual payors. This dynamic has offered opportunities to healthcare companies that can control cost and/or improve the overall quality of healthcare. Mr. Swedish has specialized in identifying these opportunities throughout his career
Expansive Universe of Targets. We intend to focus our investment effort broadly across the healthcare industry, with an emphasis on the full continuum of healthcare services, healthcare information technology, supply chain or business support services, medical technology, medical devices and diagnostics. We believe that our investment and operating expertise in healthcare across multiple industry verticals will give us a large, addressable universe of potential targets. The diversity of the target universe and the number of sub-sectors maximize the likelihood that the management team will be able to identify and execute an attractive transaction.
 

6
 

Unique Expertise Required to Invest in Healthcare. Our team believes that the complexity of the healthcare industry requires investors and management to have significant sector-specific knowledge and expertise to identify and appropriately analyze investment opportunities and successfully operate thereafter. Technical and scientific knowledge, an understanding of the reimbursement and regulatory environment, complex valuation and deal structuring, specialized accounting treatments, and regulatory and political uncertainty, among other considerations, may deter competition from other investors.
Acquisition Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy is to identify and acquire a compelling opportunity within our target industry and build a successful public company. We believe that our teams’ and directors’ experience evaluating assets through investing and building companies will enable us to source the highest quality targets. Our selection process will leverage the relationships of our team with industry leaders, strategic partners, venture capitalists, private equity and investment managers, respected peers, and our network of investment banking executives, attorneys and accountants. Together with this network of trusted partners, we intend to capitalize the target business and create purposeful strategic initiatives in order to achieve attractive growth and performance targets.
 
We will focus on targeting companies in the broader healthcare complex, including in healthcare services, healthcare IT, supply chain management, medical technology, medical devices, and diagnostics that are generating cost savings and improving the quality of care for the healthcare industry.
 
Consistent with our acquisition strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.
 

• | Established companies with proven track records, but opportunities for operational improvements
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Innovative products or services that meet market needs (lower costs and / or improve quality)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Solid leadership with significant knowledge of target markets
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong competitive position
--+----------------------------


• | Ability to enhance growth and scale through strategic partnerships and could benefit from the relationships and experience of our management team and Concord
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reliable demand that will drive recurring revenue
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions
--+---------------------------------------


• | Appropriate valuation
--+----------------------


• | Benefit from being a public company
--+------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our management may deem relevant.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
 
Our Initial Business Combination Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 

7
 

Members of our management team indirectly own our common stock and/or private placement warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.
 
Certain of the members of our management team are employed by Concord, an affiliate of our sponsor. Our sponsor and its affiliates are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue and the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating any legal obligation. Our officers and directors would continue to be subject to all other fiduciary duties owed to us and our stockholders and no other waivers of their respective fiduciary obligations have been provided to any such officers and directors. We do not have any plan for any waiver of the fiduciary duties of our officers and directors post-business combination.
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other special purpose acquisition company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination.
 
For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

Effecting our initial business combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Certain members of our management team are employed by Concord, an affiliate of our sponsor. Messrs. Swedish, Olsen and Jose are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted, or had any discussions, formal or otherwise with, any prospective target business with respect to a business combination transaction with us.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.
 
In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test.
 

9
 

To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information, which will be made available to us.
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters.
 
The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and any public shares it may acquire in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Our other directors and officers have also entered into the letter agreement, which imposes the same obligations on them with respect to any public shares acquired by them.
 
Submission of our initial business combination to a stockholder vote
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our initial stockholders have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote their founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers also have agreed to vote in favor of our initial business combination with respect to public shares acquired by them, if any. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares without voting and, if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination. Our other directors and officers have also entered into the letter agreement, which imposes the same obligations on them with respect to any public shares acquired by them.

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares and any public shares it may acquire in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Our other directors and officers have also entered into the letter agreement, which imposes the same obligations on them with respect to any public shares acquired by them.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem public shares so long as (after such redemptions) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001, either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
 

11
 

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing or Exchange Act registration.
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our initial stockholders have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote their founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. Our directors and officers also have agreed to vote in favor of our initial business combination with respect to public shares acquired by them, if any. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares without voting and, if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination. Our other directors and officers have also entered into the letter agreement, which imposes the same obligations on them with respect to any public shares acquired by them.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemptions) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001, either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem public shares so long as (after such redemptions) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001, either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.

Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 
Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have three officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
