ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
Overview
 Gopher Protocol Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, “Gopher”, “Gopher Protocol” or "GOPH”) was incorporated on July 22, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Gopher is a development stage company that is creating innovative mobile microchip (ICs) and software technologies based on GopherInsight™, technology that the Company has an exclusive license to market in perpetuity. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company generated $165,000 from the provision of IT services to Guardian Patch LLC, a related party.
 
GopherInsight™ is a patented, licensed, real-time heuristic- (self-learning/artificial intelligence) based mobile technology. GopherInsight™ chip technology, if successfully fully developed, will be able to be installed in mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.) as well as stand-alone products. It is intended that GopherInsight™ software applications will work in conjunction with GopherInsight™ microchips across mobile operating systems, providing computing power, advanced database management/sharing functionalities and more. The technology under development consists of a smart microchip, mobile application software and supporting software. The system contemplates the creation of a global network. Upon development, the Company believes that its microchip technologies may be installed within mobile devices or on SIM cards. The Company and Guardian Patch, LLC are currently rolling out the following products:
 
Products:
 

(i) | Guardian Patch & Guardian Pet Tracker - The Company has applied the mobile technology into an electronic circuit including a proprietary microchip that is within a sticky patch package (the "Patch"). The Patch can be affixed to any object, mobile or static, which will enable the object to which it is affixed to be tracked remotely. It is our goal to have the electronic circuit communicate with other similar working patches via a separate, secured and private network. Upon affixing the Patch on an object, the circuit is turned on, after which the electronic circuit regularly transmits an identification signal in order to identify the device's geographical location. The Patch works in conjunction with a software application to provide tracking function operations. The system includes its own power source. The Patch will also perform an emergency feature. In the event of an emergency situation, one would simply peel the Patch off. Upon removing the Patch, it operates in a constant transmission mode, sending emergency signals. The patch also alerts the user's friends and family about the user's location. No GPS or conventional network, such as GSM, is needed. The Company and its JV partner Guardian Patch, LLC are also currently ramping up their efforts for the release of their Guardian Pet Tracker, which is primarily designed for pets, but may also be used for tracking children, adults, including the disabled, inventory, artwork or virtually any object located within an area covered by the device. The Guardian Pet Tracker (also known as the "Sphere") system is a derivative technology of the Company's Guardian Patch technology. The Sphere is designed to provide its users with local tracking capability using a rechargeable/replaceable battery source. The Sphere is an innovative tracking device that can easily be attached to a pet’s collar and then transmit real-time location information to the smartphone(s) or website account of the registered owner of the device. The Sphere has a rechargeable battery and operates on the exclusive Guardian private network which provides owners with the unique ability to obtain real-time tracking information without the need for GPS, Wi-Fi or cellular service. The Sphere includes state of the art radio technology, a GPS system and micro controller systems, with a potential “back-up” Bluetooth unit. The Sphere sends signals in specific intervals to report on its location. The Sphere’s system analyzes the information using its proprietary, advanced mathematical modeling software that precisely calculates the Sphere's location. The Sphere's mobile application then presents the exact location of the Sphere on the map. An additional unique system feature is the Sphere's Emergency Alert system. Users of the Sphere have the ability to transmit emergency alerts directly from their mobile apps, which transmit their Sphere locations. All registered users located in such a Sphere's proximity will be notified about the Emergency and may notify the user about the Sphere's recovery (which we fondly refer to as a “private emergency alert”). The Sphere utilizes a bi-directional system which enables data transmission/receiving acknowledgment. It also includes error correction protocol to ensure data accuracy. The Sphere has its own rechargeable battery. The Sphere also comes with its own ID. This ID is registered on the mobile app to track the Sphere's location. Multiple Spheres can be registered on the same app for multiple tracking. The Company anticipates beginning an online pre-sales in March 2017.

(iii) | PUZPIX - While developing the core technology of the Company, and relying on prior knowledge, the Company and its technology licensing partner, Guardian Patch LLC and Alpha EDA, LLC, developed PUZPIX (version I) as a social media game. PUZPIX is a social media game based on GOPHERINSIGHT™ technology licensed by the Company. The game uses a computerized framework to create a puzzle from images that users upload onto the system’s server. The user creates an account and has the option to store images in the designated "Friends" area and/or in the designated "All" (public) area. Only approved friends will be granted access to the images in the "Friends" area and all players have access to the "All" area. Upon a user’s request, the system turns an image into a puzzle of at least nine pieces, though more challenging puzzles can be made once the user achieves a higher level of skill. Upon the Company and its Partners launching their GopherInsight™ integrated circuit technology, of which there is no guarantee, the Company also hopes to develop a version III of PUZPIX to include domestic / international exchanges of puzzle pieces that could be shared worldwide. In addition to allowing its users to upload short videos to share with their PUZPIX "Friends", which appear as thumbprint puzzles of the videos, the new and advanced Version 2.8 also allows its users to post links to YouTube videos, which also appear as thumbprint puzzles of the videos. Once a personal video puzzle or a YouTube video puzzle has been assembled, the user can then watch the video in its entirety, immediately after which the video automatically disappears and cannot be saved. The feature which allows users to upload videos from their libraries can only be utilized between PUZPIX "Friends", while posting links to YouTube videos can be shared between "All" users. The Company and its Partners are examining the possibility of launching a crowdfunding campaign for the PUZPIX app.

(iv) | Guardian Pack - While developing the core technology of the Company, and relying on prior knowledge, the Company and its technology licensing partner, Guardian Patch LLC and Alpha EDA, LLC, developed this application. The current version is a mobile application to track groups and families via a GPS-enabled map. The objective of the app is to enable group tracking in real time. The user creates a group, by inviting members into the group. The app includes a FindMeNow feature, where users can find other members of their group on a map. The Company intends to provide the GuardianPack application for free to users, and will likely charge a subscription for advanced features, to be developed.

The Company and its technology licensing partners, Guardian LLC and Alpha, are preparing to introduce these new products (Epsilon, Guardian Pack & PuzPix) to the market this year, and the Sphere in the first quarter of 2017. The Epsilon product will be presented for time-based license agreements utilizing a designated website on top of customary distributing channels for the product. Epsilon is under confidential evaluation agreement with third party.
 
Regulatory
 
The Company has commenced development, and the Company has completed the Statement of Work (SOW) for the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) survey to deploy the Company's Guardian Global Tracking Device within the continental US. The Company has also completed their transmitters/transceivers modules feasibility research. Although the Company can use open channels and, therefore, is not required to comply with various FCC regulations relevant to the system, the Company is seeking to comply with FCC regulations. The FCC regulates the limits of potentially harmful interference to licensed transmitters due to low power unlicensed transmitters. The Guardian Patch/Sphere system consists of advanced security protocols in order to maintain the global, private, fully-secured network. In addition, the Guardian Patch device needs to perform communication tasks across the globe providing breakthrough tracking features.  The Company and its technology licensing partner, Guardian LLC, successfully completed thorough research that involved security, performance and FCC regulations compliance. Based on this research, a set of particular frequencies was chosen to be used by Guardian LLC.  By the end of this year, the Company completed the design and construction of the Guardian Patch/Sphere circuit prototype device. The Company has completed the construction of 10 prototype units, and performed intensive testing program to be tested as a complete system in designated areas by the Company. In December 2016, Guardian LLC issued Statement of Work for the Placement and Development of Guardian Sphere and its Base System. For this project, Guardian LLC has assembled a team of eight, including a Project Manager, CTO, digital and software engineers, a specialist algorithm mathematician and project leader. This team was assembled by Guardian LLC, and is based in the USA, Europe and Asia. Per the Joint Venture agreement, Guardian LLC is funding the SOW project.
