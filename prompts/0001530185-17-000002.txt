Item 1. Business
History and Organization
 
We were incorporated on December 27, 2010 as ATVRockN, as a Nevada corporation. We consider ourselves to be an emerging growth company under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. (See “Implications of Being an ‘Emerging Growth Company’ ” below in this Section. Under our original business plan, it was our intention to market a "housing molding" product to place audio equipment and lighting on 4-wheel drive vehicles such as All Terrain Vehicles (“ATV”) and Utility Terrain Vehicles (“UTV”). We did not manufacturer any units, we utilized the services of a contract manufacturer to make the unit for us. We had no material agreement with our contract manufacturer other than we paid them to produce product for us based on our needs. As we are undercapitalized, we were unable to produce the required housing molding(s) we believe would best sell in the ATV/UTV aftermarket.
Implications of Being an “Emerging Growth Company
 
As a public reporting company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company we:

· | are not required to obtain an attestation report from our auditors on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as “compensation discussion and analysis);
· | are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden-parachute” votes); 
· | are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure; 
· | may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A; 5 
· | are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act; and 
· | are exempt from any PCAOB rules relating to mandatory audit firm rotation and any requirement to include an auditor discussion and analysis narrative in our audit report. 

 We intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under §107 of the JOBS Act.
 
Certain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation report regarding management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.
 
Under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Furthermore, under current SEC rules we will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we (1) have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or (2) for so long as we have a public float of zero, have annual revenues of less than $50 million during our most recently completed fiscal year.
 
Investors should be aware that we will be subject to the "Penny Stock" rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in Penny Stocks. These regulations may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for our stock, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares.

Business of Issuer
 
Management is currently seeking new business opportunities referred by various sources, including its officer/director, professional advisors, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals.
 

Selection of a Business
 
ATVRockN anticipates that businesses for possible acquisition will be referred by various sources, including its officer/director, professional advisors, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. ATVRockN will seek businesses from all known sources, but will rely principally on personal contacts of the officer/director and his affiliates, as well as indirect associations between him and other business and professional people. While it is not presently anticipated that ATVRockN will engage unaffiliated professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations, such firms may be retained if management deems it in the best interest of the Company.
 

Process of Selection
 
ATVRockN will not restrict its search to any particular business, industry, or geographical location, and management reserves the right to evaluate and enter into any type of business in any location. It may participate in a newly organized business venture. On the other hand, it may select a more established company entering a new phase of growth or in need of additional capital to overcome existing financial problems.
 
In seeking a business venture, the decision of management will not be controlled by an attempt to take advantage of any anticipated or perceived appeal of a specific industry, management group, product, or industry, but will be based on the business objective of seeking long-term capital appreciation in the real value of ATVRockN.
 

Time Frame of the Selection Process
 
The period within which we may participate in a business acquisition cannot be predicted and will depend on circumstances beyond our control, including the availability of businesses, the time required to complete our investigation and analysis of prospective businesses, the time required to prepare appropriate documents and agreements providing for our participation, and other circumstances. It is anticipated that the analysis of specific proposals and the selection of a business will take several months.

Acquisition of a Business
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, or other reorganization with another corporation or entity; joint venture; license; purchase and sale of assets; or purchase and sale of stock, the exact nature of which cannot now be predicted. On the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that ATVRockN's present management and shareholder will not be in control of the company. In addition, ATVRockN 's sole director may, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and his vacancy under Nevada law, NRS 78.335(5) be replaced by new director without vote of our shareholders.
 
While the actual terms of a transaction to which we may be a party cannot be predicted, it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to structure the acquisition as a so-called "tax-free" event under sections 351 or 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In order to obtain tax-free treatment under section 351 of the Code, it would be necessary for the owners of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the stock of the surviving entity. In that case, ATVRockN's shareholders, including investors in this offering, would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Section 368(a)(1) of the Code provides for tax-free treatment of certain business reorganization between corporate entities where one corporation is merged with or acquires the securities or assets of another.
 
Generally, we will be the acquiring corporation in such a business reorganization, and the tax-free status of the transaction will not depend on the issuing of any specific amount of stock of the surviving entity. Consequently, there is a substantial possibility that the shareholders of ATVRockN, immediately prior to the transaction, would retain less than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Therefore, regardless of the form of the business acquisition, it may be anticipated that the investors will experience a significant reduction in their percentage of ownership in the company.
 
Notwithstanding the fact that the Company is technically the acquiring entity in these circumstances, generally accepted accounting principles will ordinarily require that such a transaction be accounted for as if the Company had been acquired by the other entity owning the business and, therefore, will not permit a write-up in the carrying value of the assets of the other company.
 
The manner in which we participate in a business will depend on the nature of the business, our needs and desires and those of the other parties involved in the negotiations, the management of the business, and the relative negotiating strengths of ATVRockN and the other management team.

We will participate in a business only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the exact terms of these agreements cannot be predicted, generally they will:
 
·         require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties involved,
 ·         specify certain events of default,
 ·         detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to it,
 ·         outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed,
 ·         set forth remedies on default, and
 ·         include miscellaneous other terms.
 
Evaluation Criteria
 
Despite his non-experience as a professional business analyst, ATVRockN's sole officer/director, Hal B. Heyer, M.D. will carefully examine businesses for acquisition.
 
Management anticipates the selection of an acquired business will be complex and risky because of the competition for such business opportunities among all segments of the financial community. The nature of the Company's search for the acquisition of a business requires maximum flexibility since the Company will be required to consider various factors and divergent circumstances which may preclude meaningful direct comparison among the various business enterprises, product or services investigated. The management of the Company will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquired business. Besides determining its fair market value, management will consider the following:
 
·         the acquired business' net worth;
 ·         the acquired business' total assets;
 ·         the acquired business' cash flow;
 ·         costs associated with effecting the business combination;
 ·         equity interest and possible management participation in the acquired business;
 ·         earnings and financial condition of the acquired business;
 ·         growth potential of the acquired business and the industry in which it operates;
 ·         experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel of the acquired business;
 ·         capital requirements of the acquired business;
 ·         competitive position of the acquired business;
 ·         stage development of the product, process or service of the acquired business;
 ·         degree of current or potential market acceptance of the product, process or service of the acquired business; and
 ·         regulatory environment of the industry in which the acquired business operates.
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. As the Company’s sole officer/director searches through the candidates for acquisition, other factors he considers relevant may apply.

The time and costs required to select and evaluate an acquired business candidate, including conducting a due diligence review, and to structure and consummate the business combination, including negotiating relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing in keeping with applicable securities laws and state corporate laws, cannot presently be stated with certainty.
 
Leverage
 
ATVRockN may be able to participate in a business involving the use of leverage. Leveraging a transaction involves the acquisition of a business through incurring indebtedness for a portion of the purchase price of that business, which is secured by the assets of the business acquired.
 
One method by which leverage may be used is to locate an operating business available for sale and arrange for the financing necessary to purchase it. Acquisition of a business in this fashion would enable us to participate in a larger venture than our limited funds would otherwise permit, or use less of our funds to acquire a business and thus commit our remaining funds to the operations of the business acquired.
 
The likelihood that we could obtain a conventional bank loan for a leveraged transaction would depend largely on the business being acquired and its perceived ability to generate sufficient revenues to repay the debt. Generally, businesses suitable for leveraging are limited to those with income-producing assets that are either in operation or can be placed in operation relatively quickly. We cannot predict whether it will be able to locate any such business. As a general matter it may be expected that ATVRockN will have few, if any, opportunities to examine businesses where leveraging would be appropriate, or to acquire financing with acceptable terms.
 
Tax Considerations
 
As a general rule, Federal and state tax laws and regulations have a significant impact upon the structuring of business combinations. ATVRockN will evaluate the possible tax consequences of any prospective business combination and will endeavor to structure the business combination so as to achieve the most favorable tax treatment to itself, the acquired business, and our respective stockholders. The IRS or other appropriate state tax authorities may, however, attempt to re-characterize the tax treatment of a particular business combination.

Form and Structure of Acquisition
 
Of the various methods and forms by which we may structure a transaction to acquire another business, management is likely to use, without limitation, one of the following forms:
 
·         a leveraged buyout transaction in which most of the purchase price is provided by borrowings from one or more lenders or from the sellers in the form of a deferred purchase price; 
 
·         a merger or consolidation of the acquired corporation into or with the Company; 
 
·         a merger or consolidation of the acquired business corporation into or with a subsidiary of the company organized to facilitate the acquisition (a "subsidiary merger"), or a merger or consolidation of such a subsidiary into or with the acquired corporation (a "reverse subsidiary merger"); 
 
·         an acquisition of all or a controlling amount of the stock of the acquired corporation followed by a merger of the acquired business into us; 
 
·         an acquisition of the assets of a business by us or a subsidiary organized for such a purpose; 
 
·         a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into the acquired business or such a subsidiary; or 
 
·         a combination of any of the above.
 

The actual form and structure for a business combination may also be dependent upon numerous other factors pertaining to the acquired business and its stockholders, as well as potential tax accounting treatments afforded the business combination.
 
As part of an acquisition, we may choose to issue additional securities that could add numerous complications depending on whether or not these would need to be registered. Dilution, change of management, additional costs, time delays or depressed prices for our stock could result.

Daily Operations
 
We expect to use attorneys and accountants as necessary, and do not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees during the phase devoted to seeking and evaluating business opportunities. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed along with the decisions specific to acquiring or participating in a specific business opportunity.
 
Until an active business is commenced or acquired, we will have only one employee, our sole officer/director for day-to-day operations. We are unable to make any estimate as to the future number of employees, which may be necessary. If an existing business is acquired it is possible that we would hire its existing staff.
 
Competition
 
We will be involved in intense competition with other business entities, many of which will have a competitive edge over us by virtue of their more substantial financial resources and prior experience in business. We also face numerous other smaller companies at the same stage of development as we are.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We do not have any trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property.
 
Based on the nature of our business, we do not expect to file any trademarks or patents.
 

Employees
 
ATVRockN currently has one employee, its sole officer/director. ATVRockN plans to utilize independent contractors on a part-time/as needed basis to assist in its development activities, marketing, and financial and accounting support.
