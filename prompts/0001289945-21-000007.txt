We deliver clinical information to care teams when and where it matters most to improve patient outcomes. Top hospitals rely on Spok products and services to enhance workflows for clinicians, support administrative compliance, and provide a better experience for patients.
Our headquarters is located at 6850 Versar Center, Suite 420, Springfield, Virginia 22151, and our telephone number is 800-611-8488. We maintain an Internet website at http://www.spok.com. (This website address is for information only and is not intended to be an active link or to incorporate any website information into this 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("2020 Form 10-K").) 
We deliver smart, reliable clinical communication and collaboration solutions to help protect the health, well-being, and safety of people in the United States and abroad, on a limited basis, in Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia and the Middle East. Our customers rely on Spok for workflow improvement, secure texting, paging services, contact center optimization, and public safety response. We develop, sell, and support enterprise-wide systems primarily for healthcare and other organizations needing to automate, centralize, and standardize their approach to clinical communications. Our solutions can be found in prominent hospitals, large government agencies, leading public safety institutions, colleges and universities; large hotels, resorts and casinos; and well-known manufacturers. We offer our services and products to three major market segments: healthcare, government, and large enterprise, with a greater emphasis on the healthcare market segment. 
Industry Overview
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease 2019 ("COVID-19") a global pandemic. The pandemic has had a severe impact on the global economy and has caused a significant strain on the healthcare industry. As hospitals struggled to maintain capacity within their intensive care units, most stopped performing elective procedures in order to free up bed capacity to meet the surge of critical COVID-19 patients. Simultaneously, there was a significant decrease in non-emergency clinic visits, resulting in a marked decrease in total clinic visits and hospitalizations. This placed a significant burden on hospital cash flow and revenue, which many were still recovering from towards the end of the year. 
While the impact of COVID-19 varies greatly from one organization or region to the next, in general, reducing costs was a critical theme for the healthcare provider industry in 2020. Initially, many organizations furloughed employees or significantly slowed the contracting process for new products or services as they braced for the unknown impacts of this virus. For some, there was a complete moratorium on renewals and new purchases. As hospitals began to better manage their admissions process and capacity constraints, they began to resume performing elective procedures in the second half of 2020. As a result, we began to see improved operating levels during this period. While we expect to see lingering effects in the healthcare provider industry from COVID-19 during 2021, we believe they will continue to diminish throughout 2021 as vaccination programs are implemented and administered.
Aside from the serious impact that COVID-19 has had on the healthcare industry, the United States healthcare market continues to experience significant change. Healthcare costs continue to rise, reimbursements from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are being reduced in certain areas, digitization of healthcare information continues and the industry continues to shift towards a value-based purchasing model and away from the traditional fee-for-service model. The value-based purchasing model places an emphasis on incentivizing value and quality at an individual patient level in order to provide better patient outcomes and reduce 30-day readmissions.
In response, healthcare providers will require greater communication and better collaboration between clinicians in order to generate improvements in the quality, safety, satisfaction and efficiency of patient care delivery. Improvements in these areas are necessary for healthcare providers to successfully navigate many of these issues. Many providers are seeking improvement through the adoption of technology, looking to take advantage of workflow automation, process improvement and, in limited circumstances, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Providers also look to increase efficiencies through consolidation as larger health systems continue to acquire smaller hospitals for the primary purpose of gaining regional market share amongst tough competition.

We believe these changes and continued pressure for organizations to provide better services with less resources place an even greater emphasis on the need for improved clinical communication and collaboration tools to meet the increasing requirements demanded by the healthcare industry in today’s marketplace. Our solutions help hospitals significantly increase the quality and safety of patient care delivery, while increasing patient and provider satisfaction and simultaneously increasing employee productivity, reducing costs and clinician burnout. This is accomplished through workflow enhancement; secure, reliable and integrated communication tools; and mobile accessibility.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We market and distribute our clinical communication and collaboration solutions through a direct sales force and an indirect sales channel.
The direct sales force contracts or sells products, solutions, messaging services and other services directly to customers ranging from small and medium-sized businesses to companies in the Fortune 1000, healthcare and related businesses, and federal, state, and local government agencies. We will continue to market primarily to commercial enterprises, with a focus on healthcare organizations, interested in our communication solutions. We maintain a sales presence in key markets throughout the United States, and in limited markets internationally including our Asia-Pacific sales team, in an effort to gain new customers and to retain and increase sales to existing customers. The direct sales force targets leadership responsible for the procurement of clinical communication and collaboration solutions such as chief information officers, chief technology officers, chief medical officers, chief nursing officers, information technology directors, telecommunications directors, and contact center managers. The timing for a direct sale varies but may take from 6 to 18 months depending on the type and scope of software solution.
In late 2020, as part of our continued transition to a Software as a Service ("SaaS") provider, we undertook a reorganization of our direct sales force. These changes are necessary in order to improve alignment between our direct sales force and our Land, Adopt, Expand, Renew ("LAER") selling methodology. The LAER selling methodology is widely considered fundamental to the success of SaaS organizations. This reorganization will see our direct sales force bifurcated into two teams; one focused solely on the addition of new customers and the other focused on the expansion of existing customers. The LAER model places significant emphasis on landing new customers which requires the direct focus, attention and coordinated efforts of a specific team. Once new customers have been obtained, a second team is responsible for establishing relationships with our existing customers and creating expansion opportunities within those relationships for additional service lines and other products or services. Finally, our Customer Success organization helps to create expansion opportunities through driving successful adoption of our products and services as well as the retention of our existing customers. These changes will largely be made by reorganizing existing resources and, as a result, we do not expect to incur significant additional costs. We expect this reorganization will be completed in the first half of 2021.
The indirect sales force complements our direct sales force. Through relationships with alliance partners we are able to sell our solutions to a wider customer base. For paging services that we do not provide directly, we contract with and invoice an intermediary for airtime services. For our software sales, relationships with alliance partners assist us in broadening the distribution of our products and further diversifying into markets outside of the healthcare provider vertical. We are expanding partnership efforts in 2021.
While we continue to identify hospitals with 200 or more beds as the primary targets for our software solutions as well as our paging services, we have recently expanded our focus to include smaller hospitals with shorter sales cycles, including academic medical centers. Within our target market, we have identified and focused our efforts to address the following dynamics:
•A heightened awareness of the ubiquitous, critical role of communications in healthcare;
•An increased focus within hospitals on quality of care and patient safety initiatives;
•The importance of confidentiality when sharing information;
•Increased regulations that may result in process changes, increased documentation and reporting and increased costs;
•A continuing focus within hospitals to reduce labor and administrative costs while increasing productivity; and
•A broader proliferation of information technology in healthcare as hospitals strive to apply technology to solve their business problems.

Marketing
We have a centralized marketing function, which is focused on supporting our solutions and sales efforts by strengthening our corporate brand, generating sales leads, and facilitating the sales process. Our principal marketing programs include:
•Content marketing (eBriefs, case studies, brochures, videos, infographics, and more) as an underlying foundation of all marketing campaigns or initiatives;
•Website development and maintenance, which provides product and Company information, customer support options, paging capabilities, as well as thought leadership and engagement;
•Participation at trade shows and industry events, such as Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, College of Healthcare Information Management Executives, Association of Medical Directors of Information Systems, American Organization of Nurse Leaders, and other Healthcare Information technology related shows and conferences;
•Webinars about customer successes, current industry trends, and our solutions;
•Social media involvement to provide information regarding upcoming educational events or new product offerings;
•Industry analyst relationships;
•Newsletters and blog posts to provide information about industry trends and our solutions to customers, prospects, and alliances; and
•Annual customer conferences that solicit feedback on our solutions and services.
Licenses and Messaging Networks
In order to provide our wireless services, we hold licenses to operate on various frequencies in the 900 MHz narrowband. We are licensed by the United States Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) to operate Commercial Mobile Radio Services (“CMRS”). These licenses are required to provide one-way and two-way messaging services over our networks.
We operate local, regional and nationwide one-way networks, which enable subscribers to receive messages over a desired geographic area. One-way networks operating in 900 MHz frequency bands utilize the FLEX™ protocol developed by Motorola Mobility, Inc. (“Motorola"). The FLEX™ protocol has advantages of functioning at higher network speeds (which increases the volume of messages that can be transmitted over the network) and of having more robust error correction (which facilitates message delivery to a device with fewer transmission errors).
Our two-way networks utilize the ReFLEX 25™ protocol, also developed by Motorola. ReFLEX 25™ promotes spectrum efficiency and high network capacity by dividing coverage areas into zones and sub-zones. Messages are directed to the zone or sub-zone where the subscriber is located, allowing the same frequency to be reused to carry different traffic in other zones or sub-zones. As a result, the ReFLEX 25™ protocol allows the two-way network to transmit substantially more messages than a one-way network using the FLEX™ protocols. The two-way network also provides for assured message delivery. The network stores, for a limited amount of time, messages that could not be delivered to a device that is out of coverage for any reason, and when the unit returns to service, those messages are delivered. The two-way paging network operates under a set of licenses called narrowband Personal Communications Service, which uses 900 MHz frequencies. These licenses require certain minimum five and ten-year build-out commitments established by the FCC, which have been satisfied.
Although the capacities of our networks vary by geographic area, we have excess capacity at a consolidated level. We have implemented a plan to manage network capacity and to improve overall network efficiency by consolidating subscribers onto fewer, higher capacity networks with increased transmission speeds. This plan is referred to as network rationalization. Network rationalization will result in fewer networks and therefore fewer transmitter locations, which we believe will result in lower operating expenses due primarily to lower site rent expenses. 
As we continue to implement our network rationalization plan, we expect to have fewer transmitters that can be removed efficiently from our networks and still maintain the level of service required for our customers, and thus the benefits of network rationalization will decline. Cost savings began to slow in 2019 and 2020 as compared to historical cost savings, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. As we reach certain minimum frequency commitments, as outlined by the FCC, we will be limited in our ability to continue our efforts to rationalize and consolidate our networks. Our messaging networks and related infrastructure are located exclusively in the United States.
Generally, our software solutions do not require licenses or permits from federal, state and/or local government agencies in order to be sold to customers. However, certain of our software products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and are subject to certification by the Joint Interoperability Test Command to be sold to the branches of the armed services of the United States and the United States government. (see "Regulation" below).

Our Strategy
We intend to drive growth in our business by building on our position as a global provider of healthcare communications, while operating an efficient and profitable business strategy.
Critical aspects of our strategy include:
Acquiring new customers - We will continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts in the healthcare market in order to identify opportunities for sales and close those opportunities in the form of bookings. We have an ongoing initiative to further penetrate the hospital segment in the United States, and while we believe there is a significant opportunity to sell clinical communication and collaboration solutions to hospitals located outside the United States, our near-term focus is on the domestic market. We intend to leverage the strength of our market presence and the breadth of our product offerings to further expand our customer base in healthcare.
The introduction of Spok Go in early 2020 is a key initiative that we believe is the basis for future growth of our software revenue and bookings. Further details on Spok Go can be found under "Spok Go platform."
Promoting strong customer adoption - We look to promote strong adoption of Spok Go through a dedicated Customer Success organization, established in 2021. Effective customer adoption is the foundation of strong customer retention and is critical to our long-term growth. We intend to drive strong adoption through the achievement of measurable outcomes which in-turn will create value for our customers.
Expanding relationships within our existing customer base - We have a significant presence in the healthcare marketplace, and we anticipate leveraging our existing customer relationships as an opportunity to transition those customers from our on-premise software solutions to Spok Go over the next several years.
Minimizing customer attrition - We continue to have a valuable wireless presence in the healthcare market, particularly in larger hospitals. We offer a comprehensive suite of wireless messaging products and services focused on healthcare and "campus" type environments and critical mission notification. We will continue to focus on network reliability and customer service to help minimize the rate of revenue attrition.
We recognize that the number of wireless subscribers, units in service, and the related revenue will continue to decline. We intend to continue reducing our underlying cost structure impacting this declining wireless revenue stream by reducing payroll and related expenses as well as network related expenses where possible. We will integrate and consolidate operations as necessary to ensure the lowest cost operational platform for our consolidated business.
Developing new applications and capabilities - As we did with the introduction of Spok Go in early 2020, we will continue to invest significantly in the research and development of new products and services as well as the expansion of Spok Go and the maintenance of existing software solutions.
Returning capital to our stockholders - We understand that our primary objective is to create long-term stockholder value. We will continue to evaluate how best to deploy our capital resources to support sustainable business growth and maximize stockholder value. We expect to continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock, or $0.50 annually, in 2021. We will continue to evaluate both market and Company factors to determine whether a common stock repurchase program is an appropriate method to return capital to our stockholders.
Products and Services
Wireless Products and Related Services
We offer subscriptions to one-way or two-way messaging services for a periodic (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual) service fee. The level of service fees is generally based upon the type of service provided, the geographic area covered, the number of devices provided to the customer and the period of commitment. A subscriber to one-way messaging services may select coverage on a local, regional, or nationwide basis to best meet their messaging needs. Two-way messaging is generally offered on a nationwide basis. In addition, subscribers either contract for a messaging device from us for an additional fixed monthly fee or they own a device, having purchased it either from us or from another vendor. We also sell devices to resellers who lease or resell them to their subscribers and then sell messaging services utilizing our networks. We offer ancillary services, such as voicemail and equipment loss or maintenance protection, which help increase the monthly recurring revenue we receive along with these traditional messaging services. We offer exclusive one-way (T5) and two-way (T52) alphanumeric pagers which are configurable to support unencrypted or encrypted operation. When configured for encryption, they utilize AES-128 bit encryption, screen locking and remote wipe capabilities. With encryption enabled these secure paging devices enhance our service offerings to the healthcare community by adding Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") security capabilities to the low cost, highly reliable and availability benefits of paging.
Table of Contents

The demand for one-way and two-way messaging services declined during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and we believe demand will continue to decline for the foreseeable future. Wireless products and services revenue represented 56%, 55% and 56% of total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As demand for one-way and two-way messaging has declined, we have developed or added service offerings in order to increase our revenue potential and mitigate the decline in our wireless revenues. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to provide customers the highest value possible.
Software 
Dependable clinical communications are paramount for individuals in healthcare and a host of other industries. We offer a number of solutions, providing our customers with the ability to communicate anywhere, anytime across a number of situations. Our solutions are used for contact centers, clinical alerting and notification, mobile communications and messaging, and for public safety notifications. 
Spok Go Platform
Spok Go is an enterprise solution that includes secure messaging, global directory, on-call scheduling and workflow automation. While Spok Go was first made available to customers in early 2020, we continue to focus our product development activities on enhancing this clinical communication and collaboration platform. Spok Go was created as an integrated cloud-native platform built on the foundation of a single, best-in-class architecture. Building Spok Go from the ground up has allowed us to place an emphasis on mobile accessibility from the beginning. Mobile accessibility is a core component of the platform and developing Spok Go with a focus on mobile application ensures that users will experience seamless transitions between mobile technologies and integrated applications, whether they are in the hospital or "on the go." Because Spok Go is a cloud-based solution, our customers are able to receive updates and enhancements seamlessly as they are released by the Company. Hosting and security are handled through our partnership with Amazon Web Services® ("AWS"). AWS provides the core infrastructure for Spok Go through AWS hosting, ensuring that customers have access to the most current and secured technologies with respect to a hosted environment where security is critical to our customers. Within Spok Go, the following applications provide optional functionality and feature sets that can enhance our customers' clinical communication experience:
•Clinical Care: Clinical Care allows customers to optimize patient care coordination and improve the patient experience by connecting clinical teams with the individuals and information needed most. The application allows for rapid response by clinical teams to urgent patient needs, providing notifications of information to any device, and also allows customers to standardize communication protocols with flexible workflow templates.
•Clinical Diagnostics: Clinical Diagnostics increases the efficiency and delivery speed of radiology and laboratory results. The removal of manual processes allows for the automation of critical test result communications. Clinical Diagnostics can also escalate critical results so that communications are not lost or inadvertently ignored. Patient safety is improved by decreasing communication failures and delays, which can result in lower cost of care and improved patient outcomes.
We anticipate future development of new functionality and enhancements will be driven by specific market needs along with our desire to expand into other service lines such as radiology, contact centers and emergency departments. We expect our close and trusted relationships with our customers will be sources for new use cases, features and solutions. Our product strategy team assesses these customer needs, conducts industry-based research and helps to ensure new releases are designed to have immediate, broad applicability, a strong value proposition and a high return on investment for both Spok and our customers.
As previously mentioned, the shift to value-based healthcare, unsustainable growth in healthcare costs and the general move towards a digital world has driven the healthcare industry toward technology in hopes of creating more efficiencies that will reduce pressure on their bottom line and increase patient care quality, safety and satisfaction. Spok Go will provide a significant value proposition for potential customers by delivering efficiencies in clinical communication and collaboration through improvements in secure messaging, workflow and automation which will ultimately lead to improvements in clinical and quality outcomes.
As we look beyond our initial 2020 release of Spok Go, we continue to expect that, through 2021, sales will largely be driven by new customers, as opposed to the transition of existing customers. We plan to continue investing in our development of Spok Go, however, we believe costs will continue to normalize through 2021. We expect growth in development costs related to Spok Go will continue to decline relative to the growth rates we have seen over the past several years. As revenues from Spok Go begin to materialize over the next several years, we anticipate improvement in our development costs relative to total software revenues.

Services
We offer a variety of professional services to assist our customers in the successful implementation of, and to maximize the benefits obtained from the use of, our software solutions. We also offer support services to enhance and refine the customer's experience throughout their relationship with Spok.
•Professional Services: We offer a full suite of professional services that are provided by a dedicated group of professional service employees. Our professional services include consultation, implementation, and training services. For both our on-premise and SaaS based software solution implementations, our professional services staff uses a branded, consistent methodology that provides a comprehensive phased work plan for both new software installations and/or upgrades. In support of our implementation methodology, we manage the various aspects of the process through a professional services automation tool. We may also use third-party professional services firms as supplemental resources to implement our solutions for customers as needed. Professional services revenue represented 12% of total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and 11% for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
•Software License Updates and Product Support (Maintenance): Software license updates and product support, which is generally referred to as maintenance when sold to customers, is an important offering to customers who utilize our on-premise software solutions. In order to support our products that provide clinical communication and collaboration solutions to our customer’s organizations, we have a dedicated customer support organization. The customer support organization provides support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year and the service can be accessed via telephone, email or the Internet via the Spok webpage. The Spok support service is augmented by third-party services where needed. Software license updates and product support are generally priced together as a percentage of the software licenses for which these services will be provided. Largely all of our customers purchase maintenance when they purchase new software licenses, after which renewals generally occur on an annual basis and are paid in advance. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified product upgrades as well as maintenance and patch releases that are released during the term of the support period. Software license updates and product support revenue (i.e. Maintenance revenue) represented 26% of total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 25% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 23% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Future sales of Spok Go are expected to generate less implementation revenue relative to legacy CCS solution sales. We anticipate that the initial implementation time for a new installation of Spok Go will be significantly less as compared to our on-premise legacy CCS solutions. Similar to historical maintenance practices, a customer's subscription to Spok Go is renewed on a recurring basis according to the service terms and is generally expected to be from one to five years. This Subscription revenue stream is inclusive of hosting, access to the Company's software platform and update and support services. We do not expect to transition a significant number of existing customers to Spok Go in 2021. However, when customers do begin to transition from our on-premise solutions to Spok Go, the license and maintenance revenue streams are expected to decrease with a corresponding increase in our Subscription revenue stream.
Sources of Equipment
We do not manufacture the messaging devices our customers need to make use of our wireless services or the network equipment we use to provide wireless messaging services. We have relationships with several vendors to purchase new messaging devices. Used messaging devices are available in the secondary market from various sources. We believe existing inventory, returns of devices from customers that canceled wireless services, and purchases from other available sources of new and reconditioned devices will be sufficient to meet expected messaging device requirements for the foreseeable future. We negotiate contractual terms with our vendors that do not directly relate to the manufacturing of the network equipment or messaging devices. The network equipment and messaging devices on which we may place our logo or label are generic.
We sell third-party equipment for use with our software solutions. The third-party equipment that we sell is generally available and does not require any specialty manufacturing to accommodate our software solutions.
We currently have inventory and network equipment on hand that we believe will be sufficient to meet our wireless and software equipment requirements for the foreseeable future.
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2020, we held 87 trademarks and seven patents, as well as one pending patent and various pending trademarks, which we believe are important to protect our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property distinguishes our business from our competition and is integral to our continued success in the area of clinical communication and collaboration solutions. The expiration dates of these trademarks range from 2021 to 2033 and can be extended for ten-year periods upon renewals.
Table of Contents

Customers
Our customers include businesses and their employees who need to be accessible to their offices or customers, first responders who need to be accessible in emergencies, and third parties, such as other telecommunication carriers and resellers that pay us to use our networks. Customers include businesses, professionals, management personnel, medical personnel, field sales personnel and service forces, members of the construction industry and construction trades, real estate brokers and developers, sales and services organizations, specialty trade organizations, manufacturing organizations and government agencies.
Our wide-ranging customer base allows for low customer revenue concentration and as a result, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
We pursue close, long-term relationships with our customers because we believe strong customer relationships enable us to retain our current customer base and expand our services and revenue to that customer base.
Competition
The competitors and degree of competition vary among our various product categories. Competition is particularly strong for our wireless messaging services. Within the wireless industry, companies compete on the basis of price, coverage area, services offered, transmission quality, network reliability and customer service. We compete by maintaining competitive pricing for our products and services, by providing broad coverage options through high-quality, reliable messaging networks and by providing quality customer service. Direct competitors for wireless messaging services include American Messaging Service, LLC and a variety of other regional and local providers. We also compete with a broad array of wireless messaging services provided by mobile telephone companies, including AT&T Mobility LLC, Sprint Nextel Corporation, T-Mobile USA, Inc., and Verizon Wireless, Inc. This competition has intensified as prices for the services of mobile telephone companies have declined and as those companies have incorporated messaging capabilities into their mobile phone devices. Many of these companies possess far greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. 
Most personal communications service and other mobile phone devices currently sold in the United States are capable of sending and receiving one-way and two-way messages. Most subscribers that purchase these services no longer need to subscribe to a separate messaging service. As a result, many one-way and two-way messaging subscribers can readily switch to cellular, personal communications service and other mobile telephone services. The decrease in prices and increase in capacity and functionality for cellular, personal communications service, WiFi, and other mobile telephone services have led many subscribers to select combined voice and messaging services from mobile telephone companies as an alternative to our stand-alone messaging services.
We also have a number of competitors whose software products compete with one or more modules of our clinical communication and collaboration solutions. These competitors are a mix of privately held and public companies that offer a number of call center, alerting and mobile communication products. Our primary competitive advantages include having:
•An integrated product suite;
•A communication-driven workflow;
•Certifications, such as those through the Joint Interoperability Test Command (see "Joint Interoperability Test Command" below) and the FDA; and
•A complete directory of contacts throughout the customer enterprise.
Table of Contents

Although there are no competitors that offer a similar comprehensive set of software modules that match our product offerings, there are several competitors who offer software similar to many of our solutions. As we continue our transition to a software company, our competitive landscape will continue to evolve. Selected competitors for portions of our product portfolio include:
•Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. - Mobile communications solutions;
•Appfolio, Inc. - Cloud-based software solutions;
•Boingo Wireless, Inc. - Mobile communications solutions;

In addition, substantially larger companies in the electronic medical records space such as Epic Systems Corporation, Cerner Corporation, Athenahealth, Inc. and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. may choose to offer software-related solutions similar to our clinical communication and collaboration solutions or may acquire one of our competitors.
Research and Development
We maintain a product development group, a substantial portion of which is focused on developing new software products, especially with respect to developing the Spok Go platform and additional enhancements. Within our research and development group is a separate task force focused on ongoing maintenance and enhancement of existing point-solution products. Our product development group uses a methodology that balances enhancement requests from a number of sources including customers, regulatory requirements, the professional services staff, customer support incidents, known defects, market and technology trends, and competitive requirements. These requests are reviewed and prioritized based on criteria that include the potential for increased revenue, customer/employee satisfaction, possible cost savings, and development time and expense. 
Human Capital
At December 31, 2020, and 2019, we had 602 and 638 full time equivalent ("FTE") employees, respectively. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Employee Health, Safety and Well-Being
Spok is committed to conducting its business operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of its employees, visitors, contractors and the public, and to the reduction of risks within our work centers. Spok believes that no job is so important that our employees cannot take the time to ensure the work is performed safely and in an environmentally conscious manner. Spok’s policies and procedures are intended to provide employees with the information needed to meet all federal, state and local guidelines for occupational health and safety.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our policies with regard to our employees, whose health and safety is our highest priority. Following strategies recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we have continued to implement enhanced safety measures, including restrictions on business travel, the implementation of remote work arrangements for our office-based employees, and liberal leave policies for employees who may be affected by illness, quarantines or childcare obligations.

Diversity and Inclusion
As a global company, Spok strives to create an environment that embraces diversity and fosters inclusion. We recognize the value and contributions of individuals with a wide range of capabilities, experience, and perspectives, and draws upon this diversity to create value for our customers and maintain an effective and engaged workforce. Spok is committed to maintaining a work environment free from discrimination and harassment, and one where employees are treated with dignity and respect. We refuse to accept or tolerate harassment or discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment. 
In 2020, Spok formed a council composed of employees and executive sponsors to provide feedback and make recommendations regarding our diversity and inclusion policies and practices. We believe that by promoting and supporting inclusiveness and by leveraging our organization’s diversity, we have a competitive advantage that allows us to innovate and draw from our workforce’s differing perspectives. By bringing together employees from diverse backgrounds and providing each an opportunity to develop their skills and actively contribute to our mission, we cultivate an engaged workforce which in turn helps us deliver value to our customers.
Ethical Standards
Integrity is a core tenet of Spok’s culture, and we have measures and controls in place to regularly ensure that our work and organization are held to the highest ethical standards. We provide numerous resources to our employees, including regular, annual training on maintaining these standards. We also maintain employee guidelines and policies that align with Spok’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
Regulation
Federal Regulation
The FCC issues licenses to use radio frequencies necessary to conduct our business and regulate many aspects of the operations that support our wireless revenue. Licenses granted to us by the FCC have varying terms, generally of up to ten years, at which time the FCC must approve renewal applications. In the past, FCC renewal applications generally have been granted upon showing compliance with FCC regulations and adequate service to the public. Other than those still pending, the FCC has thus far granted each license renewal that we have requested.
The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"), requires radio licensees, including us, to obtain prior approval from the FCC for the assignment or transfer of control of any construction permit or station license or authorization of any rights thereunder. The FCC has thus far granted each assignment or transfer request we have made in connection with a change of control.
The Communications Act also places limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licenses, which constitute the majority of our licenses. These foreign ownership restrictions limit the percentage of stockholders’ equity that may be owned or voted, directly or indirectly, by non-United States citizens or their representatives, foreign governments or their representatives, or foreign corporations. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits the redemption of our equity from stockholders where necessary to ensure compliance with these requirements.
The FCC’s rules and regulations require us to pay a variety of fees that otherwise increase our costs of doing business. For example, the FCC requires licensees, including Spok, to pay levies and fees, such as universal service fees, to cover the costs of certain regulatory programs and to promote various other societal goals. These requirements increase the cost of the services we provide. By law, we are permitted to bill our customers for these regulatory costs and we typically do so.
Additionally, the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994, ("CALEA") and certain rules implementing CALEA require some telecommunication companies, including Spok, to design and/or modify their equipment in order to allow law enforcement personnel to "wiretap" or otherwise intercept messages. Other regulatory requirements restrict how we may use customer information and prohibit certain commercial electronic messages, even to our own customers.
In addition, the FCC’s rules require us to pay other carriers for the transport and termination of some telecommunication traffic. As a result of various FCC decisions over the last few years, we no longer pay fees for the termination of traffic originating on the networks of local exchange carriers providing wireline services interconnected with our services. In some instances, we received refunds for prior payments to certain local exchange carriers. We have entered into a number of interconnection agreements with local exchange carriers in order to resolve various issues regarding charges imposed by local exchange carriers for interconnection.
Failure to follow the FCC’s rules and regulations can result in a variety of penalties, ranging from monetary fines to the loss of licenses. Additionally, the FCC has the authority to modify licenses, or impose additional requirements through changes to its rules.

The FDA has determined software systems that connect to medical devices are subject to regulation as medical devices as defined by the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FDC Act"). Since our middleware software products connect to medical devices, we are required to comply with the FDC Act’s requirements, including but not limited to: registration and listing, labeling, medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events), removal and correction, and good manufacturing practice requirements. We have complied with the regulatory requirements of the FDC Act, and registered and received the necessary clearances for our products. As we modify and/or enhance our software products (including our middleware product), we may be required to request FDA clearance before we are permitted to market these products.
In addition, our software solutions may handle or have access to personal health information subject in the United States to the HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), and related regulations. These statutes and related regulations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of personal health information with which we help our customers comply. Our failure to accurately anticipate or interpret these complex and technical laws could subject us to civil and/or criminal liability. We believe that we are in compliance with these laws and their related regulations.
Although these and other regulatory requirements have not, to date, had a material adverse effect on our operating results, such requirements could have a material impact on our operating results in the future. We monitor discussions at the FCC and FDA on pending changes in regulatory policy or regulations; however, we are unable to predict what changes, if any, may occur in 2021 to regulatory policy or regulations.
State Regulation
As a result of the enactment by the United States Congress of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA") in August 1993, states are now generally preempted from exercising rate or entry regulation over any of our operations. States are not preempted, however, from regulating "other terms and conditions" of our operations, including consumer protection and similar rules of general applicability. Zoning requirements are also generally permissible, however, provisions of the OBRA prohibit local zoning authorities from unreasonably restricting wireless services. States that regulate our services also may require us to obtain prior approval of (1) the acquisition of controlling interests in other paging companies and (2) a change of control. 
At this time, we are not aware of any proposed state legislation or regulations that would have a material adverse impact on our business.
Joint Interoperability Test Command ("JITC") Certification
JITC is a military organization that tests technology for use by the branches of the armed services of the United States and the United States government. JITC certification is required of all systems with joint interfaces or joint information exchanges with other systems used by these organizations and is done to ensure all systems operate effectively together. All information technology and national security systems that exchange and use information to enable units or forces to operate effectively in joint, combined, coalition and interagency operations and simulations must be certified. Once a system has been certified under this program, the certification must be renewed every four years or after any changes that may affect interoperability. The interoperability certification process consists of four basic steps, which are:
•Identify (interoperability) requirements;
•Develop certification approach (planning);
•Perform interoperability test and evaluation; and
•Report certifications and statuses.
We submit and receive JITC certification for certain of our products through the Defense Information Systems Agency, which allows us to sell and implement our solutions at federal government agencies. We currently certify a console, web, speech, mass notification, public safety answering point, call recording and campus 911 product with JITC. We have a roadmap to renew the existing certifications with new releases of existing products and to bring additional products to JITC to increase the products that can be sold to federal agencies.
