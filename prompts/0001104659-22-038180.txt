Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in February 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination or business combination. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from our initial public offering.
Our objective is to partner with a disruptive software business with demonstrated strong momentum, platform characteristics and multiple avenues of growth in a large addressable market with favorable secular trends, by leveraging the industry expertise, relationships and network of our management team, directors and sponsor, their experience building companies as founders, advisors, leaders and board members, and the capital raised in this offering. Beyond the core business objective to help acquire and take an enterprise software company public, our team and board of directors are united around a common goal: to invest in the next generation of Black entrepreneurship and leadership. Pursuant to this goal, Catalyst Partners Acquisition Corp. has contributed a portion of its sponsor economics to support the creation of a Catalyst Partners Foundation, a non-for-profit entity that champions initiatives supporting the economic empowerment and inclusion of underrepresented groups. Following the business combination, we seek to serve as a long-term partner to the Chief Executive Officer and management team of the newly combined company to grow the business as a public company and build a category leader.
Our sponsor is an affiliate of General Catalyst, a technology-focused investment firm with offices in San Francisco, Palo Alto, New York, and Boston, with approximately $7.5 billion raised in total subscriptions over 10 fund vintages. General Catalyst’s investment strategy is to partner closely with founders to build high growth companies that withstand the test of time. The firm’s mission is to invest in powerful, positive change that endures — for entrepreneurs, investors, people, and society. Founded in Boston in 1999, General Catalyst has a proven track record of successfully investing in leading technology companies in both the private and public markets, and is known for its deep expertise in enterprise software and other high growth technology markets.
General Catalyst has successfully executed over 465 private transactions with companies in various stages of their life cycles, from early to mid-stage and late-stage investments, including over 45 companies with an enterprise value over $1 billion. The firm has helped support the growth of businesses such as Airbnb, BigCommerce, Cazoo, Datto, Deliveroo, Demandware, Gusto, HubSpot, Livongo Health, Ping Identity, Oscar, Samsara, Snap, Stripe, and Warby Parker. All of these investments have increased in value since General Catalyst’s initial investment.
General Catalyst has a track record of identifying and investing in high conviction public market success stories early and supporting them through their growth journeys. The firm actively helps portfolio companies consider strategic options including going public through traditional initial public offerings, direct listings and mergers and acquisitions. Prior investments include current and previously public software companies like Airbnb (IPO 2020), BigCommerce (IPO 2020), Datto (Acquired by Vista 2017, followed by IPO 2020), Demandware (IPO 2012 and acquired 2016), HubSpot (IPO 2014), Kayak (IPO then acquired later in 2012), Lemonade (IPO 2020), Livongo Health (IPO 2019 and acquired 2020), Ping Identity (Acquired by Vista 2016, followed by IPO 2019), Snap (IPO 2017), Vroom (IPO 2020) and Oscar Health (IPO 2021).
General Catalyst implements a full-stack venture capital model that connects and compounds the value of investing at inception through a company’s rapid inflection phases, and enables the firm to have widespread reach and on-ground presence in the industry and into companies of all scale, size, and our thematic areas of focus. We believe the firm derives unique and differentiated insights thanks to its sector specialization and involvement with mainstream companies across the technology and growth life cycle in key software sectors.

● | Early Venture Strategy: General Catalyst’s early stage strategy focuses on identifying and supporting the best founders at the earliest stage possible. The firm backs first-time and experienced founders, as well as nascent teams, at the ideation phase of enterprise and consumer solutions with Seed stage investments from $500 thousand to $2 million.

industries ripe for change through innovation and digital transformation. Investing early into businesses helps General Catalyst build long-term relationships with founders and management teams. These relationships and General Catalyst’s industry network will serve as key pillars of our sourcing strategy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growth Venture Strategy: General Catalyst’s growth venture strategy focuses primarily on partnering with founders whose businesses are at an inflection point and show strong potential for meaningful scale, mainly targeting fast growing businesses poised to become market leaders.

● | Creation Strategy — Hatch and XIR Programs: Through General Catalyst’s Hatch and Executive-in-Residence (XIR) programs, the firm also collaborates with world-class executives to create a new business or identify an existing growth-stage business to transform with them. Through these partnerships and active company building, General Catalyst can accelerate the trajectory and improve the eventual outcome of a business. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Endurance Strategy: Through the endurance strategy, General Catalyst partners with once-in-a-generation companies. These companies have transformed industries and continue to demonstrate the ability to move beyond a first act to second or third iterations of their growth potential. General Catalyst helps these founders take measured risks to continue their growth trajectory, maintain the agility of a startup while operating with the discipline of a public company, all while preparing for the future.

General Catalyst and our team have two decades of investing experience in the enterprise software sector, particularly in our target areas of focus, from cybersecurity to data and analytics, infrastructure software and application software, with a track record of doubling down on our high conviction investments and creating significant shareholder value over time. The firm’s expertise in these key sectors of focus that typically require deep domain knowledge and expertise for successful investments is evidenced by its representative portfolio of private software companies that include, but are not limited to:

● | Cybersecurity: Aura, Black Duck Software, Illumio, Ping Identity 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data and Analytics: Datalogix, Hive, RStudio, ThoughtSpot 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Infrastructure: Datto, Fivetran, GitLab, SignalFx 
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Applications: airSlate, Applied Intuition, BigCommerce, Canva, Clarabridge, Contentful, Demandware, Drift, Grammarly, Guild Education, Gusto, HubSpot, Mark43, Olive, OM1, PathAI, Samsara, TrueMotion 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial Technology: Fundbox, Melio, Rapyd, Stripe 
--+-----------------------------------------------------

General Catalyst also has significant experience and expertise in the public equity markets for blank check companies as evidenced by the successful debut of its previous affiliated SPACs, Health Assurance Acquisition Corp (“HAAC”) and Revolution Healthcare Acquisition Corp. (“RHAC”). To reflect the economic transformation of the healthcare industry, HAAC and RHAC were incorporated with a new structure, SAILSM, or Stakeholder Aligned Initial Listing, to remove friction, align stakeholder interests, and reward sustained, long-term performance. HAAC completed its successful initial public offering in November 2020, in which it sold 52.5 million SAILSM securities, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one warrant to purchase one-fourth of one share of HAAC Class A common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per SAILSM security, generating gross proceeds of $525 million. RHAC completed its successful initial public offering in March 2021, in which it sold 55.0 million SAILSM securities, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one warrant to purchase one-fifth of one share of RHAC Class A common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per SAILSM security, generating gross proceeds of $550 million. Neither HAAC nor RHAC has announced or completed its initial business combination.

Catalyst Partners is another extension of General Catalyst’s pursuit of collaborating with the best founders and teams with disruptive businesses in attractive markets, and it represents a further evolution of General Catalyst’s deep roots and expertise in identifying category trends and enterprise software winners early in their development, to partner with, and support the journey of, high conviction companies. We believe that CPAR is the next step in allowing us a creative and flexible way to partner with an exceptional business and team. Since General Catalyst’s inception, 20 of its private portfolio companies have consummated traditional IPOs. While we continue to believe that traditional IPOs are appropriate for many companies, and direct listings for others, we also believe that going public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, will be the best choice for a wide range of high-growth companies. Our deep network, track record, focus on disruptive businesses, and experience across the life cycle of software businesses makes us uniquely positioned to identify and execute a successful business combination. Our management team, directors and General Catalyst have extensive operational, commercial and transactional experience with software companies in our target sectors, and we intend to use these skills and credentials to identify market leaders for an initial business combination.
Our Opportunity and Focus
The Enterprise Software Market
Over the past two decades, the evolution of technology has disrupted and reinvented many industries, giving rise to many new category-defining businesses and creating outsized value for technology investors in the public markets. Software companies in particular continue to influence and reinvent how businesses operate, driving innovation and productivity across the enterprise. Organizations worldwide are undergoing a significant digital transformation, and increasingly look to adopt technology solutions that lead to differentiated offerings, faster time to market, and an improved ability to meet the needs of customers and employees. Gartner estimates enterprise Information Technology spending on software will expand from $3.3 trillion in 2020 to $3.9 trillion by 2023(1). The COVID-19 pandemic has at once accelerated the pace and demonstrated the value of the digital transformation of the workplace. The almost-overnight need for workers to operate from home and for offline commerce to shift to digital has spurred rapid adoption of collaboration tools like video conferencing software, revealed the value of cloud-based infrastructure, security, and applications, and accelerated the overall digital transformation of the enterprise. IDC predicts that by the end of 2021, 80% of enterprises will put a mechanism in place to shift to cloud-centric infrastructure and applications twice as fast as before the pandemic. Trends long in motion are being catalyzed and are likely to retain their momentum after lockdowns ease, while new trends will emerge and shape the next generation of business processes, particularly in many functional areas and industries historically resistant to innovation. We believe that the rate of change in enterprise software is increasing, highlighting vulnerabilities in legacy products and business models, and expanding the universe of investable opportunities poised to unseat incumbents.
Our Opportunity
Our objective is to identify, acquire, and help govern a category-defining platform in a secular-growth area that will compound over the long-term. We look for disruptive technology with demonstrated momentum, platform effects and multiple avenues of growth in a large addressable market with favorable secular trends. We believe enterprise software is a large and growing category of focus for investors. The proliferation of public cloud platforms and the availability of venture capital has allowed new entrants to grow extremely rapidly, gaining scale and attractive unit economics earlier in their company life cycles, resulting in an acceleration in the number of public market candidates of scale. According to CB Insights, more than 450 software technology companies worldwide who have raised venture capital at more than a $1 billion valuation are still private.1

We believe that a number of private enterprise software companies are poised for significant future growth, yet lack the capital, management expertise and operational efficiency to do so. These companies look for the many noteworthy benefits to being publicly traded during their growth stage, including increased brand awareness, access to capital markets, and investment and acquisition currency. A business combination with Catalyst Partners would provide targets with several benefits, including increased certainty of proceeds and de-risked valuation, a valuation based on longer-term business outlook, a faster route to public markets with reduced management distraction, and a valuable and collaborative partnership with a top-tier sponsor that brings deep expertise in business expansion, go-to-market, product strategy and marketing, governance, recruitment, strategic acquisitions, and investor relations. We believe there is a significant backlog of software companies that are both looking to go public and that are interested in leveraging the benefits of a SPAC to make that transition. We believe we are well-positioned among SPAC sponsors to address these needs given our two decades of experience investing in software companies and creating significant shareholder value.
Our Focus
Based on General Catalyst’s broad and deep experience investing in enterprise software companies, we will focus our search on targets that either address or benefit from a number of trends, including but not limited to those described below. We believe these sectors are among those that are poised for accelerated technological advancements and breakthrough innovation, and hold the potential to disrupt large industries serving major global markets.
Cybersecurity Software
Cyber attacks and data breaches continue to increase in frequency, severity, and impact to organizations across sectors. The rise of cloud computing, increased workforce mobility and the growth in connected devices across industries has made devices, applications and data highly distributed and diverse further challenging organizations to monitor and protect their networks and workloads running on various endpoints. The accompanying movement of workloads to the cloud and the edge has caused an increase in complexity for Information Technology teams to manage hybrid and multi-cloud environments, and an expansion in the attack surface for adversaries. Fueled in part by the pandemic, current geopolitical environment, and a sudden shift to remote working environments, security remains a top priority for CIOs and CISOs, but the number of vendors and point solutions in the space can be overwhelming. The ongoing secular shift in cybersecurity is driving rapid growth in budgets and spending, and reorienting cybersecurity preparedness as a strategic imperative for businesses of all types. The cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, providing opportunities for software vendors to provide innovative solutions to emerging areas of vulnerability across network, application, and cloud security, as well as identity and access management, among other areas.
Data and Analytics Software
Data is at the heart of business innovation and organizations everywhere are seeking ways to transform their businesses by capturing, analyzing, and mobilizing data. The proliferation of data provides valuable insights for organizations, including key business and performance metrics, customer attributes and behavior, and product strengths and capabilities. Advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies hold the potential to allow businesses to leverage big data to better understand and respond to subtle changes in behavior, preferences or customer satisfaction levels, and drive significant enhancements in their business models and operations. While organizations everywhere look to data for a competitive edge, a fraction of organizational data is analyzed today and new tools are required to unlock value from fragmented and unstructured data. Organizational systems today are designed to collect everything irrespective of usefulness. Further, mission-critical data continues to be split across data warehouses and data lakes, and locked in both on-premises and cloud data silos. As every role and function within an organization becomes a mainstream data consumer, new challenges for data integrity and governance arise with the increasing demands for sharing data across functions, business units, clouds, borders and systems. Organizations increasingly look to deploy modern data infrastructure and analytical tools to address these challenges, bridge data silos to achieve full organizational connectivity, and leverage organizational data assets to create new monetization models for their businesses.

Next-Gen Infrastructure Software
Companies across all industries are heavily investing in underlying infrastructure to digitally transform their businesses and enhance the experience of their customers and productivity of their employees. A significant majority of time spent in all US occupations is spent on collecting data, processing data, and predictable physical activities, and a majority of this effort is spent on activities that can be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technology. Connecting customers and employees efficiently to the outcomes they want, while also delivering consistent and relevant experiences, requires managing the automation of processes from the infrastructure layer up. This is driving an ongoing seismic shift from static on-premises Information Technology architectures to distributed, dynamic hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. By 2024, total worldwide spending on cloud services, the hardware and software components underpinning cloud services, and the professional and managed services opportunities around cloud services is expected to surpass $1.0 trillion while sustaining a double-digit CAGR of 15.7% according to IDC. As new delivery models like the cloud introduce more complexity, the need for Information Technology teams to instrument, monitor, and automate the management of infrastructure will increase and these new requirements come with a new set of tools and development models. As companies seek to compete more effectively by releasing quality software at a more frequent cadence, organizations look to unify software development and Information Technology operations teams to streamline infrastructure management. With this shift comes the need for new tools for DevOps teams that can manage and secure applications, automate manual processes, and enable flexible application architectures, driving shorter release cycles and efficient management of complexity at scale.
Application Software
Across industries, organizations are accelerating digital transformation processes for long-term growth and profitability. Software applications that layer on intelligence and data to help improve business outcomes and productivity are gaining strong adoption in response. The demand for cloud-based enterprise applications and Software-as-a-Service continues to grow as companies seek improved scalability, configurability, lower total cost of ownership, and to shift spending from capital expenditures to operating expenditures, among other benefits. According to IDC, the share of public cloud application deployments will increase from 40% in 2019 to 57% by 2024.
The growing adoption of enterprise applications affects every aspect of business and opens new opportunities for disruptive software businesses and their investors alike. As digital transformation projects continue to accelerate the pace of Software-as-a-Service and cloud-based deployments, including software to support new customer, employee, and commerce experiences, we see these categories as key areas of focus for our company.

● | Front Office Software: Customer expectations, preferences, and needs have changed dramatically in response to pandemic-induced social distancing requirements. More than ever before, customers want to engage and buy online, forcing businesses everywhere to transform their operations from physical to digital. Front office applications, including Customer Experience and Relationship Management platforms, Marketing Automation platform, and other customer facing technologies have now become synonymous with digital transformation for many organizations as companies seek to form a holistic 360-degree-view of their customers and provide a unified customer experience across channels. According to IDC, 80% of CIOs will implement intelligent capabilities to sense, learn, and predict changing customer behaviors by 2025, enabling exclusive customer experiences for engagement and loyalty. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Future of Work: As formerly desk-bound employees remain in large part working from home (or in distributed locations) and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future, innovation in collaboration and remote work solutions has the opportunity to define, design and support the future of work for desk workers. Similarly, enterprises look to software platforms to better support, engage, and equip their desk less workforce around the globe with the tools they need to succeed. By 2022, 65% of CIOs will digitally empower and enable frontline workers with data, artificial intelligence, and security to extend their productivity, adaptability, and decision making in the face of rapid changes, according to IDC. Enterprises also look to software solutions to improve access to healthcare, education, coaching and upskilling opportunities, insurance, and other benefits that enrich the experience for all employees and help them to lead a more fulfilled life. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Back Office Software: Back office functions such as supply chain and finance have not benefited from the same degree of digitization initiatives that have transformed customer-facing and revenue-generating business areas like sales and marketing in the past. These categories remain ripe for innovative solutions to replace manual and paper-based workflows and business processes with automated and digital processes. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5




● | Vertical Software: Businesses in markets like real estate, manufacturing, financial services, education, and construction, among others have unique needs typically not addressed by horizontal software platforms. While vertical software vendors typically have a smaller addressable market than horizontal applications, these markets often exhibit winner-take-most dynamics, allowing best-of-breed solutions to gain market share rapidly. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial Technology
One of the biggest opportunities brought forth by rapid technological innovation is in the realm of financial services. The digitization of records and workflows has moved processes from the physical world of atoms to the zero-marginal cost world of bits. This shift has driven a massive increase in the ability to leverage both economies of scale and network effects in an ever growing market where technical debt and legacy assets have hampered incumbents’ ability to innovate. The most successful fintech platforms have helped abstract away layers of complexity while providing the core enabler of the financial system — trust. The list of innovative private companies is rich with opportunity and many of the players are now showing signs of a reinforcing flywheel where growth and adoption begets further expansion. Opportunities abound across many categories including Payments & Transactions, Record Keeping and Information Sharing, Credit Provisioning, Risk Transfer, Payroll and Benefits, Procurement & Invoicing, Treasury Management, Regulatory and Compliance Processes.
The Outlook
The world’s businesses are running on enterprise software platforms. Companies’ processes are wired into these systems and the investments in people, processes and technology are vital to their daily operations. Accelerating global digitalization of businesses and the shifting perceptions of a digital, technology-enabled “future of work” environment will continue to accelerate and reinforce the critical nature and resiliency of such assets. Innovations such as cloud and mobile computing, data and analytics, and cybersecurity, catalyzed by corresponding shifts in enterprise software business models, will continue to unlock accelerated cycles of organizational change and value creation in the future, radically impacting industries and business processes across the world.
Software continues to undergo disruption comparable to other tectonic shifts in Information Technology, such as the shift from mainframe computing to client and server computing two decades ago. As automation and digitization transform the economy, well-resourced incumbents in the industry are losing out to upstarts. Emerging disruptors such as ServiceNow and Salesforce have seen a manifold higher growth in their cumulative public market capitalization in the past five years compared to incumbents like SAP, Oracle and IBM. While the old guard was disrupted seemingly overnight, we believe innovations in technology and business models will continue to drive explosive future growth for enterprise software, creating new opportunities for emerging disruptors. We believe these secular trends and market opportunities offer attractive areas of focus for our business, aligned with the advantages we bring to a potential target.

Prior Special Purpose Acquisition Vehicle Experience
Our investment team and board of directors have a deep understanding of the equity capital markets for blank check companies. In September 2020, an affiliate of our sponsor, General Catalyst, founded HAAC with the mission to partner with leading healthcare businesses leveraging technology and to help them become iconic category winners that accelerate the digital transformation of healthcare into a new system of health assurance.
Health Assurance Acquisition Corp. was structured to reflect the economic transformation of the healthcare industry. To achieve its mission, HAAC was incorporated with a new structure, SAILSM, or Stakeholder Aligned Initial Listing, to remove friction, align stakeholder interests, and reward sustained, long-term performance. Under the SAILSM structure, initial stockholders are able to capture 20% to 30% of the year-over-year share-price performance (20% for first 30% performance, 30% thereafter) on all capital raised in connection with the transaction, which will include gross proceeds from the IPO and any subsequent capital raised in connection with the merger.
HAAC completed its successful initial public offering in November 2020, in which it sold 52.5 million SAILSM securities, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one warrant to purchase one-fourth of one share of HAAC Class A common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $525 million. HAAC has not yet announced or completed its initial business combination.

In addition, in January 2021, General Catalyst and ARCH Venture Management, LLC created RHAC to execute its part in a broad mission of enabling the digital transformation of care, bringing disruptive innovation to the healthcare system through technology by eventually partnering with a leading businesses at the intersection of health care, life sciences and technology to redesign health care around the patient. RHAC is similarly using the SAILSM structure and completed its successful initial public offering in March 2021, in which it sold 55.0 million SAILSM securities, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one warrant to purchase one-fifth of one share of RHAC Class A common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per SAILSM security, generating gross proceeds of $550 million. RHAC has not yet announced or completed its initial business combination.
As a repeat SPAC sponsor with a strong investment track record in the software sector, we believe potential sellers of target businesses will favorably view our management team’s credentialed experience and familiarity with the SPAC markets in considering whether or not to enter into a business combination with us. However, past performance by members of our management team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical record of our management’s performance as indicative of our future performance.
Full Resources of Our Management Team and Directors
Our management team, directors and strategic advisors have collectively decades of direct management experience growing public and private companies via organic growth, acquisitions and strategic mergers. Our team’s combined experience, far-reaching networks, and long-standing relationships will provide valuable access to the highest quality software companies and will produce unique insights and opportunities for growth and value creation. This experience provides a key foundation that we believe will allow us to source exceptional opportunities and enhance the innate qualities of a future partner company.
We have recruited and organized a group of ten highly accomplished, engaged, diverse and connected directors and advisors who will bring to us public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight and capital markets expertise. Our efforts to seek a suitable business combination target are complemented and augmented by the expertise and network of relationships of our directors, who each have extensive experience in business and financial matters. Our board members and advisors have served as directors, chief executive officers, chief financial officers or in other executive and advisory capacities for numerous publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. Our directors and advisors have extensive experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and possess relevant domain expertise in the enterprise software sector where we expect to source business combination targets including, but not limited to, cybersecurity, data and analytics, infrastructure software, application software and financial technology. Collectively, our management team and board of directors (including our board advisors) have held more than 30 C-suite and director roles at public companies, which today have a collective market cap of more than $7 trillion and include 16 Fortune 500 companies, such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Salesforce, and Facebook. Our team and board include leading business and community figures that have received numerous accolades including the 2019 Inspire Award by the San Francisco Business Times, Financial Woman of the Year by Financial Women of San Francisco in 2017, One of Silicon Valley’s and San Francisco Business Times’ Women of Influence and Black Enterprise’s 75 Most Powerful Women, National Minority Quality Forum’s Lifetime Achievement Award, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund National Equal Justice Award Winner and three Emmy Awards for broadcast journalism.

We believe their collective expertise, contacts and relationships make us a highly competitive and desirable business combination partner in the enterprise software space. Our management team is also well positioned to identify and execute a business combination as a preferred partner to a high-quality software company.
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination that can create value for our shareholders over time.
We believe our investment team and board of directors’ prior experience and our network of relationships should allow us to identify a wide range of attractive opportunities for the company. Our team’s networks include, among others, entrepreneurs, public and private company management teams, from early stage ventures to the Fortune 500, venture capital and private equity investors, investment bankers, attorneys, and management consultants. We intend to deploy a proactive, thematic and sector-specific sourcing strategy to focus on companies where we believe the combination of our industry experience, relationships, capital and investing expertise can be catalysts to transform companies and can help accelerate the target business’ growth and performance.
We also plan to leverage the General Catalyst investment team’s capabilities, relationships, network, and deal pipeline to support us in the identification and diligence of potential targets. By leveraging General Catalyst’s prior investment experience and track record, rigorous differentiated bottoms-up research approach and deep understanding of key business metrics and growth strategies, we are uniquely positioned to focus on stellar companies with our comprehensive view of the software sector.
Collectively, our team and General Catalyst also bring considerable expertise and resources in target sourcing, transaction structuring, financial, operational and strategic due diligence, capital markets, and ongoing business support and governance best practices across a broad set of disciplines, along with a continued commitment to our mission: to invest in powerful, positive change that endures.
We expect to remain involved in the post-merger entity and to collaborate with the management team to strengthen the business’ compounding growth. We believe our experience investing in and operating technology companies, along with our history of supporting world-class management teams, differentiates us as a potential partner for a leading high-growth technology company.
Our Founder Share Structure
We believe that Catalyst Partners offers an attractive proposition compared to other blank check companies and other sources of equity capital. We bring a singular focus and depth of expertise to the enterprise software sector. In addition to our expertise, reputation, and network, which together give us a competitive advantage in sourcing and consummating one or more business combinations, we have designed Catalyst Partners’ founder share structure to provide better alignment of incentives than a typical blank check company. The Class B ordinary shares only provide our initial shareholders with significant value if our Class A ordinary shares, following our initial business combination, experience significant price appreciation, which we believe aligns our interests with the interests of both our public stockholders and continuing stockholders of any targets we may seek to acquire. Importantly, unlike most SPACs, our sponsor will receive a financial benefit that is directly coupled to the value that is created for the investors. Any such benefit will also flow to the Catalyst Partners Foundation as owner of 10% of our founder shares and help further our mission.
The Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares after our initial business combination only to the extent certain triggering events occur prior to the 10th anniversary of our initial business combination including three triggering events based on our stock trading at $12.50, $15.00 and $17.50 per share, in three tranches of 25%, 25% and 50% of founder shares, respectively, following the first anniversary of the closing of our initial business combination and also upon a specified strategic transaction following our initial business combination if the effective price per Class A ordinary share is at least equal to $12.00 in such transaction, in each case, as described in this Report. We believe this better aligns the incentives of our initial shareholders with that of our investors. We refer to our founder share structure as SOARSM (Shared Opportunity Aligned Returns).

Catalyst Partners Foundation
We are a special purpose acquisition company driven by a unique and critical mission: to use our significant experience and resources to acquire a business that shows a high degree of positive impact and a strong culture in the realm of diversity and inclusion. Diversity in business is a must today. Enlightened businesses will choose to nurture diversity as a business advantage and to align with social responsibilities and societal expectations. We believe more diverse businesses will show sustainable advantages in operating performance, and over time can drive attractive growth and strong investment returns.
Beyond the core business objective to help acquire and take an enterprise software company public, our team and board of directors are united around a common goal: to invest in the next generation of Black entrepreneurship and leadership. Pursuant to this goal, we have implemented the SOARSM structure to support the mission of Catalyst Partners Foundation, a non-for-profit entity to champion initiatives supporting the economic empowerment and inclusion of underrepresented groups. The entity will be led by Dr. James Cash, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, with input and collaboration from the rest of the board and our sponsors.
The Catalyst Partners Foundation is meant to encourage business leaders to put in place actions that foster equity. We believe the result will be a flywheel of positive, systemic change, to address what has been a historical lack of access to investment capital for these firms. There are few publicly traded diverse-led businesses or firms directly focused on economic inclusion, and therefore limited options for investors to express what we believe is a growing interest to invest in diverse or inclusive companies.
​
Business Combination Criteria
We have identified the following framework to evaluate prospective target businesses. We may decide, however, to enter into our initial business combination with one or more businesses that do not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to pursue an initial business combination with companies that have the following characteristics:

11




● | Visionary founder: We will look for talented and ambitious founders who have a clear vision for their business, a deep understanding of their customer and respective markets, and are backed by world-class management teams who are capable of scaling a global business with the support of our capital and knowledge resources. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large market opportunity: We have a track record of finding opportunities in markets and segments that themselves are growing as well as with companies that are taking share in large but stable markets. We will prioritize our focus on investments in large and growing industries, with attractive structural and competitive dynamics, that are ripe for new entrants to make significant share gains by disrupting incumbents or capitalizing on secular market trends. We will leverage the broad expertise of our team and General Catalyst to identify companies that enjoy secular trends leading to the disruption of large incumbent industries or the creation of entirely new categories. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong momentum: We believe that demonstrated, sustainable growth is a key determinant in identifying a strong target business and is one of the best indicators of future success. Our collective experience, knowledge and skills as seasoned operators in high growth environments provides a distinct advantage to our team in terms of identifying and selecting strong business combination targets and assessing the sustainability of past performance and the potential for strong growth in the future. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Multiple “acts” to the story: Our roots lie in investing and supporting high quality companies throughout their life cycle. We partner with a long investment horizon, supported by rigorous analysis, to discover and build conviction in companies that can deliver sustainable top-line growth for the long-term and create outsized returns for all stakeholders. Our bias is for companies with multiple avenues of growth with the potential to continue disruptive innovation at every stage of their life cycle and whose growth will continue to compound over the years to come. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform characteristics: We will look for “platform” businesses with defensible long-term business models that enjoy the benefits of a disruptive technology, powerful network effects, a unique brand, developing ecosystem, or an expanding data-scale advantage. We seek businesses protected by proprietary technology advantages, especially scientific breakthroughs and intellectual property. These companies have the unique potential to provide a governance structure and evolve into a set of standards and protocols that facilitate interactions at scale in their markets so that network effects can be unleashed. Many of the most successful high growth software platforms use their data-scale to create a formidable competitive advantage and deliver superior customer value, which allows them to scale quickly and take market share in large addressable markets. We believe that our deep operating experience will allow us to understand, analyze and assess the potential of these unique companies, and leverage the full strength of our franchise and help them create a protected moat, which provides for years of durable, compounding growth, and expanding margins. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Superior economic model: We will aim to invest in a growth-stage company with a rapidly scalable model, as well as a clear path to profitability. We believe that strong unit economics are necessary to achieve profitability and sustainable growth in the long-term. Our team has deep expertise in fundamental analysis and strong familiarity with enterprise software business performance trends and benchmarks to discover software businesses with superior economic attributes. We will prioritize software businesses with high gross margin, favorable customer retention trends, high capital efficiency and best-in-class return on invested capital. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to these business criteria, we expect any potential acquisition target to be ready or almost ready to operate in the public markets from the perspective of corporate governance, financial reporting, compliance, and anticipated investor receptivity. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as on other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

12



Our Acquisition Process
In evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to seek to determine a company’s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, multiple meetings with management, consultations with relevant industry experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, including a company where any of them have a minority investment. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Members of our and General Catalyst’s management teams, including our officers and directors, directly and indirectly own our securities and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors, as well as our and General Catalyst’s management teams, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination.
Each of our directors and officers, as well as those of General Catalyst, presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our or General Catalyst’s officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, to the extent applicable. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.
In addition, General Catalyst, our sponsor, officers and directors may participate in, and our officers and directors have already participated in, the formation of other blank check companies prior to completion of our initial business combination, and any of our officers and directors may also become an officer or director of any of such other blank check companies. As a result, General Catalyst, our officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company, including HAAC and RHAC, with which they may become or are involved. However, we do not currently expect that General Catalyst or any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to identify and complete our initial business combination. In addition, General Catalyst and our sponsor, officers, and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time or resources to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time and resources among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.

13



Initial Business Combination
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on the Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.

14



Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.

15



Financial Position
With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $334,586,905, after payment of as of December 31, 2021 $12,026,137 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our initial public offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We have not selected any business combination target. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business, other than our officers and directors. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in our initial public offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter.
Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.

16



Sources of Target Businesses
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms, including one or more of the underwriters or one of their respective affiliates, or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates paid by us any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17



Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
Under the Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:

● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;

● | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.

Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination, and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or during any Extension Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
Limitations on Redemptions
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with the Nasdaq rules.
If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

20



In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at a general meeting. In such case, our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial purchaser’s founder shares, we would need 12,026,138, or 35.0% (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted) of the 34,360,391 public shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination, and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or during any Extension Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.

21



Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

22



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we have only 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.
Our initial shareholders and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame).
Our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director, or any other person.

23



We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $2,550,000 held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by (A) a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or (B) a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.

24



We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $2,550,000 following our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $2,650,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $2,550,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.
If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy or insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.

25



Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we will pay to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
