     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Company Overview 
         We are a biopharmaceutical company that currently supports the clinical stage development of a telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in hematologic myeloid malignancies, by Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen. Early clinical data, including molecular responses in essential thrombocythemia, or ET, and remission responses, including reversal of bone marrow fibrosis, in myelofibrosis, or MF, suggest imetelstat may have disease-modifying activity by inhibiting the progenitor cells of the malignant clones for the underlying diseases.

           On November 13, 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Janssen the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology, including hematologic myeloid malignancies, and all other human therapeutic uses. The Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 15, 2014, and we received $35 million from Janssen as an upfront payment. Additional consideration under the Collaboration Agreement includes potential payments of up to an aggregate maximum total of $900 million for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on worldwide net sales of imetelstat. 
         Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is wholly responsible for developing, manufacturing, seeking regulatory approval for, and commercialization of, imetelstat worldwide. To that end, Janssen is currently conducting two clinical trials of imetelstat: IMbark, a Phase 2 trial in MF, in which the first patient was dosed in September 2015; and IMerge, a Phase 2/3 trial in myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, in which the first patient was dosed in January 2016. 
         In September 2016, Janssen completed planned internal reviews of data from both IMbark and IMerge. Following these internal reviews, Janssen determined to continue the trials in order to obtain additional and more mature data. In the first quarter of 2017, Janssen initiated the process for the second internal data reviews for both IMbark and IMerge, which will include comprehensive analyses encompassing safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, as well as other exploratory assessments, such as cytogenetic and molecular data. We expect the outcomes from the second internal data reviews, regulatory considerations and the totality of other program information, including the evolving treatment landscapes in MF and MDS, to inform Janssen's decisions regarding future development plans for imetelstat. Following the second internal data reviews, we expect Janssen could decide to resume, modify or terminate IMbark, IMerge, the imetelstat program or the Collaboration Agreement. We expect Janssen's decision-making regarding IMbark, IMerge, the imetelstat program or the Collaboration Agreement to occur in the second quarter of 2017. Janssen's decisions regarding future development plans for imetelstat, if any, may be subject to subsequent regulatory feedback. While patients remaining in the treatment phase of IMbark and IMerge continue to be dosed with imetelstat, new patient enrollment in both trials currently is suspended until completion of the second internal data reviews. 
         We had approximately $129.1 million in cash and investments as of December 31, 2016. To grow and diversify our business, we plan to continue our business development efforts to identify, and seek to acquire and/or in-license other oncology product candidates, programs or companies. Acquisition or in-licensing opportunities that we may pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness or seek equity capital, or both. 
   Telomerase: Scientific Rationale 
   Telomeres and Telomerase in Normal Development 
         In the human body, normal growth and maintenance of tissues occurs by cell division. However, most cells are only able to divide a limited number of times, and this number of divisions is regulated by telomere length. Telomeres are repetitions of a deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, sequence located at the ends of chromosomes. They act as protective caps to maintain stability and integrity of the chromosomes, which contain the cell's genetic material. Normally, every time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten. Eventually, they shrink to a critically short length, and as a result, the cell either dies by apoptosis or stops dividing and senesces. 
         Telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that maintains telomeres and prevents them from shortening during cell division in cells, such as stem cells that must remain immortalized to support normal health. Telomerase consists of at least two essential components: a ribonucleic acid, or RNA, template (hTR), which binds to the telomere, and a catalytic subunit (hTERT) with reverse 
 4

   transcriptase activity, which adds a specific DNA sequence to the chromosome ends. The 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine was awarded to Drs. Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack Szostak, former Geron collaborators, for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by both telomeres and telomerase. 
         Telomerase is active during embryonic development, enabling the rapid cell division that supports normal growth. During the latter stages of human fetal development and in adulthood, telomerase is repressed in most cells, and telomere length gradually decreases during a lifetime. In tissues that have a high turnover throughout life, such as blood and gut, telomerase can be transiently upregulated in progenitor cells to enable controlled, self-limited proliferation to replace cells lost through natural cell aging processes. As the progeny of progenitor cells mature, telomerase is downregulated and telomeres shorten with cell division, preventing uncontrolled proliferation. 
   Telomeres and Telomerase in Cancer 
         Telomerase is upregulated in many tumor progenitor cells, enabling the continued and uncontrolled proliferation of the malignant cells that drive tumor growth and progression. Telomerase expression has been found to be present in approximately 90% of biopsies taken from a broad range of human cancers. Our nonclinical studies, in which the telomerase gene was artificially introduced and expressed in normal cells grown in culture, have suggested that telomerase does not itself cause a normal cell to become malignant. Instead, the sustained upregulation of telomerase enables tumor cells to maintain telomere length, providing them with the capacity for limitless proliferation. We believe that the sustained upregulation of telomerase is critical for tumor progression as it enables malignant progenitor cells to acquire cellular immortality and avoid apoptosis, or cell death. 
   Telomerase Inhibition: Inducing Cancer Cell Death 
         We believe that inhibiting telomerase may be an attractive approach to treating cancer because it may limit the proliferative capacity of malignant cells. We and others have observed in various in vitro and rodent tumor models that inhibiting telomerase results in telomere shortening and arrests uncontrolled malignant cell proliferation and tumor growth. In vitro studies have suggested that tumor cells with short telomeres may be especially sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of inhibiting telomerase. Our nonclinical data also suggest that inhibiting telomerase is particularly effective at limiting the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells, which have high levels of telomerase and are believed to be important drivers of tumor growth and progression. 
 Imetelstat: The First Telomerase Inhibitor to Advance to Clinical Development 
         Imetelstat is a lipid conjugated 13-mer oligonucleotide that we designed to be complementary to and bind with high affinity to the RNA template of telomerase, thereby directly inhibiting telomerase activity. Imetelstat does not elicit its effect through an antisense inhibition of protein translation. The compound has a proprietary thio-phosphoramidate backbone, which is designed to provide resistance to the effect of cellular nucleases, thus conferring improved stability in plasma and tissues, as well as improved binding affinity to its target. To improve the ability of imetelstat to penetrate cellular membranes, we conjugated the oligonucleotide to a lipid group. Imetelstat's IC50, or half maximal inhibitory concentration, is 0.5 - 10 nM in cell free assays. Single-dose kinetics in patients has shown dose-dependent increases in exposure to imetelstat, with a plasma half-life, which is the time it takes for the concentration or amount of imetelstat to be reduced by half, ranging from 4 - 5 hours. Data from animal studies and clinical trials have suggested that the residence time of imetelstat in bone marrow is long, with 0.19 - 0.51 ÂµM observed at 41 - 45 hours after a 7.5 mg/kg dose in patients. Imetelstat also has been shown in nonclinical studies to exhibit relatively preferential inhibition of the clonal proliferation of malignant progenitor cells compared to normal progenitors. For these reasons, imetelstat has been studied as a treatment for malignant diseases. 
 5

           Imetelstat is the first telomerase inhibitor to advance to clinical development. The Phase 1 trials that we completed evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of imetelstat. We established doses and dosing schedules that were tolerable and achieved target exposures in patients that were consistent with those required for efficacy in animal models. The dose-limiting toxicities were thrombocytopenia, or reduced platelet count, and neutropenia, or reduced neutrophil count. Following intravenous administration of imetelstat using tolerable dosing regimens, clinically relevant and significant inhibition of telomerase activity was observed in various types of tissue in which telomerase activity is measurable, including normal bone marrow hematopoietic cells, malignant plasma cells, hair follicle cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
   Disease Characteristics of Hematologic Malignancies 
         Hematologic malignancies, or blood cancers, are classified according to the predominant location of the malignancy. A hematologic myeloid malignancy is a cancer that occurs in the precursor cells to red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells such as granulocytes. Examples include acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, MDS and the myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as ET, polycythemia vera and MF. These are different from lymphocytic malignancies which typically occur in the lymphoid lineage that includes white blood cells, such as T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. Examples of lymphoid malignancies include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas and multiple myeloma. 
         Many hematologic myeloid malignancies, such as ET, MF, and MDS, have been shown to arise from malignant progenitor cells in the bone marrow that express higher telomerase activity and have shorter telomeres when compared to normal healthy cells. 
   Unmet Medical Need in Myelofibrosis 
         MF, a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, is a chronic blood cancer in which abnormal or malignant precursor cells in the bone marrow proliferate rapidly, causing scar tissue, or fibrosis, to form. As a result, normal blood production in the bone marrow is impaired and may shift to other organs such as the spleen and liver, which can cause them to enlarge substantially. People with MF may have abnormally low or high numbers of circulating red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets, and abnormally high numbers of immature cells in the blood or bone marrow. MF patients can also suffer from debilitating constitutional symptoms, such as drenching night sweats, fatigue, severe itching, or pruritus, abdominal pain, fever and bone pain. The estimated prevalence of MF in the United States, or U.S., is approximately 13,000 patients, with an annual incidence of approximately 3,000 patients. Up to 20% of patients with MF develop acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. 
         Approximately 70% of MF patients are classified as having intermediate-2 or high risk disease, as defined by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System Plus, or DIPSS Plus, described in a 2011 Journal of Clinical Oncology article. There is currently only one targeted drug therapy, ruxolitinib, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other health authorities for treating these MF patients. Currently, no drug therapy is approved for those patients who fail or no longer respond to that treatment, and median survival for such MF patients is only approximately seven months, representing a significant unmet medical need. 
 Inadequacy of Conventional Treatments in Myelodysplastic Syndromes 
         MDS are a group of blood disorders in which the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones in the bone marrow results in disordered and ineffective production of the myeloid lineage, which includes red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. In MDS, bone marrow and peripheral blood cells may have abnormal, or dysplastic, cell morphology. MDS is frequently characterized clinically by severe anemia, or low red cell counts and low hemoglobin. In addition, other peripheral cytopenias, or 
 6

   low numbers of white blood cells and platelets, may cause life-threatening infections and bleeding. Transformation to AML occurs in up to 30% of MDS cases and results in poorer overall survival. 
         MDS is the most common of the myeloid malignancies. There are approximately 60,000 people in the United States living with the disease and approximately 12,000 reported new cases of MDS in the United States every year. MDS is primarily a disease of the elderly, with median age at diagnosis around 70 years. The majority of patients, approximately 70%, fall into what are considered to be the lower risk groups at diagnosis, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, or IPSS, that takes into account the presence of a number of disease factors, such as cytopenias and cytogenetics, to assign relative risk of progression to AML and overall survival. 
         Chronic anemia is the predominant clinical problem in patients who have lower risk MDS. Many of these patients become dependent on red blood cell transfusions, which can lead to elevated levels of iron, which the body has no normal way to eliminate, in the blood and other tissues. Iron overload is a potentially dangerous condition. Studies in patients with MDS have shown that iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions is associated with a poorer overall survival and a higher risk of developing AML. 
   Developing Imetelstat to Treat Hematologic Myeloid Malignancies 
   Proof-of-Concept of Imetelstat's Disease-Modifying Potential 
         Early clinical data, including molecular responses observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial of imetelstat in patients with ET, or the ET Trial, and partial or complete remissions, that included reversal of bone marrow fibrosis in patients with MF, observed in a pilot study of imetelstat conducted at Mayo Clinic, or the Pilot Study, suggest imetelstat may exhibit disease-modifying activity by inhibiting the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones. These data were published in two separate articles in the September 3, 2015 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. In addition, the Pilot Study included a cohort of patients who had a sub-type of MDS referred to as refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, or RARS. A small number of these patients achieved a period of red blood cell transfusion independence longer than eight weeks when treated with imetelstat. These data were published in the March 2016 online issue of Blood Cancer Journal. 
         Reported adverse events, or AEs, and laboratory investigations associated with imetelstat in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study included cytopenias, gastrointestinal symptoms, constitutional symptoms, and hepatic biochemistry abnormalities. Dose-limiting toxicities, such as profound and prolonged thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and other safety issues, including death, were observed in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study. In those trials, such myelosuppression was managed by dose holds and modification rules. 
         In March 2014, the FDA issued a full clinical hold on our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for imetelstat, citing a lack of evidence of reversibility of hepatotoxicity, concern regarding a risk of chronic liver injury, and a lack of adequate follow-up in patients who had hepatotoxic effects. Follow-up safety data showed that liver function test, or LFT, abnormalities resolved to normal or baseline during or after withdrawal of imetelstat treatment in most patients. We submitted a complete response to the FDA, and the FDA lifted the clinical hold in October 2014. Also in March 2014, we were informed by Mayo Clinic that the investigator's IND for the Pilot Study was placed on partial clinical hold by the FDA due to a safety signal of hepatotoxicity and that it was unknown if this hepatotoxicity was reversible. The investigator submitted a complete response to the FDA, and the partial hold was removed by the FDA in June 2014.

  IMbark 
         IMbark was initiated to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two dose levels of single-agent imetelstat in patients with MF. The trial was originally designed to enroll approximately 200 patients, including approximately 100 patients per dosing arm, with DIPSS intermediate-2 or high risk MF who have relapsed after or are refractory to JAK inhibitor treatment. At the time of enrollment, patients must have measurable splenomegaly and symptoms of MF. Patients were assigned randomly on a blinded basis in a 1:1 ratio to one of two dosing armsÂ9.4 mg/kg every three weeks or 4.7 mg/kg every three weeks. Dose reductions for adverse events are allowed and follow protocol-specified algorithms. 
 8

          
        The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the trial are spleen response rate and symptom response rate. Spleen response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve Â³35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline at the Week 24 visit, as measured by imaging scans and assessed at a central imaging facility and by an Independent Review Committee. Symptom response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have Â³50% reduction in Total Symptom Scores from baseline at the Week 24 visit, based on patient-reported outcomes on a modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form version 2.0 electronic diary. Secondary efficacy endpoints include the number of patients achieving complete remission, or CR, or partial remission, or PR, clinical improvement, or CI, and anemia, spleen and symptom responses as assessed using the modified 2013 International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment, or IWG-MRT criteria, described in a 2013 Blood article. These secondary endpoints will be assessed at the time of the primary efficacy analysis. Exploratory endpoints include cytogenetic and molecular responses, as well as leukemia-free survival. 
         Safety outcomes are monitored throughout the trial and include enhanced data collection and reporting for adverse events of interest, including hepatobiliary-associated laboratory findings and hepatic adverse events. 
         IMbark is being conducted at multiple medical centers across North America, Europe and Asia. Study design information for IMbark, including patient eligibility criteria, and clinical sites is posted on clinicaltrials.gov. 
   Outcomes of First Internal Data Review of IMbark
        To inform an assessment of the appropriate dose and schedule of imetelstat for relapsed or refractory MF patients in IMbark, in September 2016, Janssen completed a planned internal review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data from 20 patients from each dosing arm who had been followed on the trial for at least 12 weeks. Based on this first internal review at the 12-week time point, the following were determined by Janssen:


Â The safety profile was consistent with the previous adverse events observed in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study. No new safety signals were
identified. 
Â Activity in the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm did not warrant further investigation of that dose, and this arm has been closed to new patient
enrollment. 
Â The 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm warranted further investigation because encouraging trends in the efficacy data were observed. However, new patient
enrollment to this arm was suspended because an insufficient number of patients met the protocol defined interim efficacy criteria at 12 weeks to confirm dosing. 

   Current Status of IMbark
        Patients remaining in the treatment phase who were originally enrolled in the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm may continue to receive imetelstat at that dose or, at the investigator's discretion may receive imetelstat at an increased dose of 9.4 mg/kg. Dosing continues for those patients remaining in the treatment phase who were enrolled in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm to obtain additional and more mature data. 
         We expect Janssen to conduct a second internal data review to assess potential future development, if any, of imetelstat in MF, as well as to assess whether 9.4 mg/kg is the appropriate starting dose and is sufficiently efficacious and safe for the IMbark patient population. In the first quarter of 2017, Janssen initiated the process for the second internal data review for IMbark, which will include comprehensive analyses encompassing safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, as well as other exploratory assessments, such as cytogenetic and molecular data, from patients 
 9

   enrolled in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm who have been followed for at least 24 weeks, consistent with the co-primary efficacy endpoints. Following the second internal review, we expect Janssen could decide to resume enrollment in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm, modify the trial, close the trial, discontinue development of imetelstat in MF, or terminate the Collaboration Agreement. We expect the outcomes from the second internal data reviews for both IMbark and IMerge, regulatory considerations and the totality of other program information, including the evolving treatment landscapes in MF and MDS, to inform Janssen's decisions regarding future development plans for imetelstat. We expect Janssen's decision-making regarding IMbark, the imetelstat program and the Collaboration Agreement to occur in the second quarter of 2017. Janssen's decisions regarding future development plans for imetelstat, if any, may be subject to subsequent regulatory feedback. 
         The protocol-specified primary analysis of the co-primary efficacy endpoints in IMbark is planned to occur after all patients (i.e., planned to be approximately 100 enrolled and treated patients on the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm) have been followed for at least 24 weeks. Due to the current suspension of new patient enrollment in IMbark, the timing of the protocol-specified primary analysis for the trial is uncertain and may be substantially delayed due to numerous factors, including whether Janssen resumes patient enrollment in the trial, or may not occur at all if IMbark is terminated early based on preliminary data, safety concerns or for any other reason. 
   IMerge 
         IMerge was initiated to evaluate imetelstat in transfusion dependent patients with IPSS low or intermediate-1 risk MDS who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with an ESA. 
         IMerge was designed as a two-part clinical trial and a total of approximately 200 patients are expected to be enrolled. Part 1 of the trial is designed as a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm design to assess the efficacy and safety of imetelstat. Part 1 of IMerge is fully enrolled with approximately 30 patients, who will all receive imetelstat and be followed for safety, hematologic improvement and reduction in transfusion requirement. Before proceeding to Part 2, the data from Part 1 must support a positive assessment of the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in these patients. Part 2 of the trial is planned as a Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design to compare the efficacy of imetelstat against placebo. Under the original design of IMerge, if the trial proceeds to Part 2, approximately 170 patients are expected to be enrolled in Part 2, and such patients will be assigned randomly, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either imetelstat or placebo. 
         The inclusion criteria for both parts of the trial require that at the time of enrollment each patient must be red blood cell transfusion-dependent. Imetelstat in Parts 1 and 2, or placebo in Part 2, will be administered as an intravenous infusion. The planned starting dose of imetelstat will be 7.5 mg/kg every four weeks and may be escalated according to certain protocol-specified conditions. Dose reductions for adverse events may follow protocol-specified algorithms. All patients may receive supportive care, including transfusions or myeloid growth factors, as needed per investigator discretion and according to local standard practices. 
         The primary efficacy endpoint of IMerge is designed to be the percentage of patients, defined by the trial protocol, who achieve red blood cell transfusion-independence lasting at least eight consecutive weeks at any time after entry to the trial. A primary efficacy analysis is planned to occur 12 months after the last patient is enrolled. 
         Secondary efficacy endpoints include the proportion of patients achieving red blood cell transfusion-independence lasting at least 24 weeks, the time to and duration of red blood cell transfusion-independence, the proportion of patients achieving hematologic improvement, the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR according to the 2006 International Working Group, or IWG, criteria for MDS, the proportion of patients requiring red blood cell transfusions and the amount, the proportion of patients requiring the use of myeloid growth factors and the dose, as well as 
 10

   assessments of the change in the patients' quality of life using several different validated instruments. Patients will be followed by Janssen for an assessment of overall survival and time to progression to AML. These secondary endpoints are expected to be assessed at the time of the primary efficacy analysis. 
         Safety outcomes are monitored throughout the trial and include enhanced data collection and reporting for adverse events of interest, including hepatobiliary-associated laboratory findings and hepatic adverse events. 
         IMerge is being conducted at multiple medical centers across North and South America, Europe and Asia. Study design information for IMerge, including patient eligibility criteria, is posted on clinicaltrials.gov. 
   Outcomes of First Internal Data Review in IMerge
        In September 2016, Janssen completed an initial internal review of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic data in a subset of patients in Part 1 of IMerge and determined that emerging safety and efficacy in IMerge were consistent with data reported from the Pilot Study conducted in MDS-RARS patients. Janssen also determined to continue IMerge unmodified. 
   Current Status of IMerge
        Part 1 of IMerge has been fully enrolled and patients remaining in the treatment phase continue to be dosed with imetelstat. As originally designed, further patient enrollment is suspended until a decision has been made to move forward with Part 2 of the trial. We expect clinical data from Part 1 of IMerge to be presented at a medical conference to be determined in the future. 
         We expect Janssen to conduct a second internal data review for IMerge to evaluate potential future development, if any, of imetelstat in MDS, as well as to determine whether to move forward to Part 2 of IMerge. In the first quarter of 2017, Janssen initiated the process for the second internal data review for IMerge, which will include comprehensive analyses encompassing safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, as well as other exploratory assessments, such as cytogenetic and molecular data, from all patients in Part 1. Following the second internal review, we expect Janssen could decide to move forward with Part 2 of IMerge, modify the trial, close the trial, discontinue development of imetelstat in MDS, or terminate the Collaboration Agreement. We expect the outcomes from the second internal data reviews for both IMbark and IMerge, regulatory considerations and the totality of other program information, including the evolving treatment landscapes in MF and MDS, to inform Janssen's decisions regarding future development plans for imetelstat. We expect Janssen's decision-making regarding IMerge, the imetelstat program and the Collaboration Agreement to occur in the second quarter of 2017. Janssen's decisions regarding future development plans for imetelstat, if any, may be subject to subsequent regulatory feedback. 
   Intellectual Property 
         Intellectual property, including patent protection, is very important to our business. We file patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect aspects of our business. An enforceable patent with appropriate claim coverage can provide an advantage over competitors who may seek to employ similar approaches to develop therapeutics, and so the future commercial success of imetelstat in collaboration with Janssen, and therefore our future success, will be in part dependent on our intellectual property strategy. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled "Risks Related to Protecting Our Intellectual Property" under Item 1A, "Risk Factors".

           The development of biotechnology products, including imetelstat, typically includes the early development of a technology, followed by rounds of increasingly focused innovation around a product opportunity, including identification and definition of a specific product candidate and uses thereof, manufacturing processes, product formulation and administration methods. The result of this process is that biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are filed at different times during product development and cover different aspects of the product. Consequently, earlier filed, broad technology patents will usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments such as product formulations, so that patent expirations on a product may span several years. Patent coverage may also vary from country to country based on the scope of available patent protection. There are also opportunities to obtain an extension of patent coverage for a product in certain countries, which adds further complexity to the determination of patent life. 
         We endeavor to monitor worldwide patent filings by third parties that are relevant to our business. Based on this monitoring, we may determine that an action is appropriate to protect our business interests. Such actions may include negotiating patent licenses where appropriate, filing oppositions against a patent, filing a request for post grant review against a patent or filing a request for the declaration of an interference with a patent application or issued patent. 
   Imetelstat 
         We own issued patents in the United States, Europe and other countries related to imetelstat. Composition of matter patents generally provide the most material coverage, and therefore may convey competitive advantages. Because imetelstat is still under development, subsequent innovation and associated patent filings may provide additional patent coverage with later expiration dates. Examination of overseas patent applications typically lags behind U.S. examination particularly where cases are filed first in the United States. It may be possible to obtain patent term extensions of some patents in some countries for claims covering imetelstat which could further extend the patent term. 

Product Candidate | U.S. Patent Status / Expiration Date | Europe Patent Status / Expiration Date | Japan Patent Status / Expiration Date
Imetelstat (composition of matter) | Issued / 2025 | Issued / 2020* | Issued / 2024 


  *
An additional composition of matter patent application for imetelstat has been filed that, if issued, would provide European patent protection until 2024. In addition, we have received patent coverage in Europe until 2029 for the use of imetelstat for the treatment of cancer utilizing certain dosing regimens. 


        Our patent rights relating to imetelstat include those covering composition claims to the drug molecule and related nucleic acid telomerase inhibiting molecules, as well as reagents useful in manufacturing processes for the drug, and method of treatment and kit claims, certain of which are co-owned with other entities. Our patent rights for imetelstat and related products whose mechanism of action is telomerase inhibition have been exclusively licensed (even as to us) to Janssen for all human disorders or medical conditions. In addition, certain of our patent rights for measuring the length of telomeres in cells have been non-exclusively licensed to Janssen. 
         Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, we remain responsible for prosecuting, at Janssen's direction, the patents exclusively licensed to Janssen, with costs shared between us and Janssen on a 50/50 basis. For intellectual property developed under the Collaboration Agreement, the party having sole ownership interest in such intellectual property will be responsible for prosecuting any such patents, with Janssen bearing all of the patent costs for such intellectual property solely owned by Janssen and for intellectual property either jointly owned or solely owned by us such patent costs to be shared between the parties on a 50/50 basis.

     Telomerase 
         Our patent rights relating to telomerase that cover technologies such as polynucleotides that encode a catalytic protein component (hTERT) of human telomerase, antibodies or antigen binding fragments that specifically bind to hTERT, and methods of drug screening using cells expressing hTERT are co-owned with and in-licensed exclusively from the University of Colorado. A patent for identifying inhibitors of telomerase activity is co-owned and in-licensed from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the University of California. We expect the last of these patent rights relating to telomerase to expire during 2019. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for additional information regarding our patent rights relating to telomerase. 
 Licensing 
   Collaboration and License Agreement with Janssen 
         On November 13, 2014, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Janssen the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology, including hematologic myeloid malignancies, and all other human therapeutic uses. The Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 15, 2014, and we received $35 million from Janssen as an upfront payment. Additional consideration under the Collaboration Agreement includes potential payments of up to an aggregate maximum total of $900 million for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on worldwide net sales. 
         Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is wholly responsible for developing, manufacturing, seeking regulatory approval for, and commercialization of, imetelstat worldwide. To that end, Janssen is currently conducting two clinical trials, IMbark and IMerge. We are contributing 50% of the development costs for these clinical trials, which Janssen is solely conducting. 
         Following the protocol-specified primary analysis of IMbark or a certain time period after the initiation of the first Phase 3 MF study, if any, Janssen must notify us of their decision, or a Continuation Decision, as to whether they elect to maintain the license rights granted to them under the Collaboration Agreement and continue to advance the development of imetelstat in any indication. In the event that IMbark is terminated early, or placed on clinical hold or suspended by a regulatory authority for an extended period of time, then Janssen must instead notify us of their Continuation Decision by the date that is approximately 24 months after the initiation of IMerge. 
         In the event that Janssen notifies us of an affirmative Continuation Decision, we then would have an option, or the U.S. Opt-In Rights, to share further U.S. development and promotion costs, including our share of development costs incurred to date by Janssen beyond IMbark or IMerge, in exchange for higher tiered royalty rates and higher future development and regulatory milestone payments if imetelstat is successfully developed and approved. If we exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights, then we and Janssen would share U.S. development and promotion costs beyond IMbark and IMerge on a 20/80 basis (Geron 20%, Janssen 80%), we would receive a $65 million milestone payment, or the Continuation Fee, at the time of an affirmative Continuation Decision, and would be eligible to receive additional potential payments of up to $470 million for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, up to $350 million for the achievement of certain sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from a mid-teens up to a low twenties percentage rate on worldwide net sales of imetelstat in any countries where regulatory exclusivity exists or there are valid claims under the patent rights exclusively licensed to Janssen. In addition, if we exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights, we then would also have a separate co-promotion option, or the U.S. Co-Promotion Option, to provide 20% of the U.S. selling effort with our sales force personnel, in lieu of funding 20% of U.S. promotion costs, upon regulatory approval and commercial launch of imetelstat in the United States. Such co-promotion would be conducted under a Janssen prepared promotion plan, and in accordance with a co-promotion 
 13

   agreement to be agreed by us and Janssen at the time of our exercise of the U.S. Co-Promotion Option. We would be responsible for all costs associated with establishing and maintaining our sales force in any conduct of such co-promotion. All product sales would be booked by Janssen. If we do not exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights, then all further development and promotion costs beyond IMbark or IMerge would be borne by Janssen, we would receive the $65 million Continuation Fee at the time of an affirmative Continuation Decision plus a $70 million payment for Janssen's retention of full U.S. rights to imetelstat, and would be eligible to receive additional potential payments of up to $415 million for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, up to $350 million for the achievement of certain sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from a double-digit up to a mid-teens percentage rate on worldwide net sales of imetelstat in any countries where regulatory exclusivity exists or there are valid claims under the patent rights exclusively licensed to Janssen. 
         Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Janssen have created a joint governance structure, including joint development and steering committees and working groups, to oversee and manage worldwide regulatory, development and manufacturing work under the joint clinical development plan and promotional activities (assuming we exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights) for imetelstat, with Janssen responsible for the operational execution of those activities. In addition, both we and Janssen may propose to the joint development committee imetelstat development for any new indications not then provided for in the joint clinical development plan and if we and Janssen agree such development should be conducted outside of the joint clinical development plan, both we and Janssen would be entitled to independently undertake such development at the developing party's own cost, subject to the other party's obligation to provide reimbursement for its specified portion of the development costs plus a premium following marketing approval of imetelstat in such newly proposed indication as a result of such independent development. In the event that we do not exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights following Janssen's affirmative Continuation Decision, the joint governance structure under the Collaboration Agreement would be dissolved, a joint oversight committee would monitor the progress of the collaboration, and we would have no further rights to conduct any independent imetelstat development. 
         After an affirmative Continuation Decision by Janssen, the Collaboration Agreement would remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent or the royalty obligations on sales of imetelstat cease, unless terminated earlier. If Janssen does not effect an affirmative Continuation Decision, then the Collaboration Agreement would terminate and all rights to the imetelstat program would revert to us. Janssen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time for convenience or due to a safety-related concern. If a notice of termination from Janssen occurs, we would be entitled to certain continued operational support from Janssen and cost-sharing under various circumstances and all rights to the imetelstat program would revert to us. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled "Risks Related to Our Business" under Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 
   License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals 
         On September 15, 2016, we entered into a license agreement, or the License Agreement, with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen Pharmaceuticals, an affiliate of Janssen, whereby we granted to Janssen Pharmaceuticals an exclusive worldwide license under our proprietary patents for the research, development and commercialization of products based on specialized oligonucleotide backbone chemistry and novel amidates for ribonucleic acid interference, or RNAi, for the prevention, treatment and/or diagnosis of any and all human disorders, excluding cancers originating from the blood or bone marrow. In connection with the License Agreement, we also granted to Janssen Pharmaceuticals a non-exclusive worldwide license under our patent rights covering the synthesis of monomers, which are the building blocks of oligonucleotides, necessary for the research, development and commercialization of the oligonucleotides. These non-exclusively licensed patent rights are licensed 
 14

   exclusively to Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement for the imetelstat program. The License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals expressly excludes products whose predominant or primary mechanism of action is telomerase inhibition and is subject to the rights and licenses granted to Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. Under the License Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $5 million from Janssen Pharmaceuticals. We are also eligible to receive additional potential development and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate maximum total of $75 million and tiered royalties in the low single digit percentage range on worldwide net sales of each licensed product commercialized under the License Agreement. Earned royalties would be subject to royalty stacking in the event that Janssen Pharmaceuticals is obligated to make royalty payments to any third party having patent claims covering a licensed product as a composition of matter. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we remain responsible for prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights under the License Agreement, with reasonable input provided by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. The costs of prosecution and maintenance of patent rights under the License Agreement will be shared 50/50 by the parties. The License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent, unless terminated earlier. The License Agreement may be terminated by either us or Janssen Pharmaceuticals in the event of uncured material breach or insolvency proceeding by the other party. Janssen Pharmaceuticals also may terminate the License Agreement at will upon prior written notice to us. In the event of early termination, all licenses granted to Janssen Pharmaceuticals would terminate. 
   Other License Agreements 
         In addition to the above agreements, we have also granted licenses to a number of other organizations in the ordinary course of our business to utilize aspects of our technologies to develop and commercialize products outside of the imetelstat program. These include:


Â licenses to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use or commercialize telomerase immortalized cells in drug discovery
research; 
Â licenses to several companies to sell antibodies specific to telomerase for research purposes; 
Â licenses to several companies to develop and commercialize reagent kits, or to provide services, for the measurement of telomere length or
telomerase activity for research purposes; 
Â a license to a company to develop and commercialize a particular telomerase-based technology for cancer detection; and 
Â a license to a company for the development of cancer immunotherapies for veterinary applications. 

         See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsÂRevenues" for a further discussion of revenues from our license agreements. We expect revenues under our license agreements related to our telomerase technology to decline significantly in the coming years, and to be eliminated by the end of 2019, due to upcoming patent expirations on such technology. 
   Concentration of Revenues 
         In 2016, we recognized revenue from the $5 million upfront payment we received from Janssen Pharmaceuticals upon our delivery of the license rights and transfer of certain know-how under the license we granted to Janssen Pharmaceuticals in September 2016. The upfront payment from Janssen Pharmaceuticals represented 81% of our 2016 revenues. In 2015, we recognized revenue from the $35 million upfront payment we received from Janssen in December 2014 upon delivery of the imetelstat license rights and completion of our performance of the technology transfer-related activities to Janssen as outlined under the Collaboration Agreement. The upfront payment from Janssen 
 15

   represented 96% of our 2015 revenues. In 2014, the majority of our revenues were from license fees and royalties under licenses granted to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use telomerase immortalized cells in drug discovery research and for drug discovery applications. Two customers accounted for approximately 31% of our 2014 revenues. We operate in one operating segment and have operations solely in the United States. All of our long-lived assets are maintained in the United States. Information regarding total revenues, net loss and total assets is set forth in our financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
   Research and Development 
         Our research and development costs were $18.0 million, $17.8 million and $20.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsÂResearch and Development Expenses" for additional detail regarding our research and development activities. 
 Manufacturing 
         A typical sequence of steps in the manufacture of imetelstat drug product includes the following key components:
 

Â starting materials, which are well-defined raw materials that are used to make bulk drug substance; 
Â bulk drug substance, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a drug product that provides pharmacological activity or other direct
effect in the treatment of disease; and 
Â final drug product, which is the finished dosage form that contains the drug substance that is shipped to the clinic for patient treatment. 

         In accordance with the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is now responsible for the manufacture and management of the supply of imetelstat on a global basis for clinical trials and, after any regulatory approval, all commercial activities. Consequently, we are, and expect to remain, dependent on Janssen to appropriately supply imetelstat and other clinical trial materials. Currently, third-party contractors perform certain process development and other technical and scientific work with respect to imetelstat, as well as supply starting materials and manufacturing drug substance and drug product. Janssen does not have direct control over third-party personnel or operations. These third-party contractors, and/or any other contractors that Janssen may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, typically complete their services on a proposal by proposal basis under master supply agreements and may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production. These third-party contractors, and/or any other contractors that Janssen may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, may not be able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at a commercially reasonable cost. Neither we nor Janssen have any long-term commitments or commercial supply agreements with any of the third-party contractors for imetelstat. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled "Risks Related to Our Business" under Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 
   Consultants 
         We have consulting agreements with drug development professionals, clinicians and regulatory experts with experience in numerous fields, including oncology and drug regulations. We retain each consultant according to the terms of a consulting agreement. Under such agreements, we pay them a consulting fee and reimburse them for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us. In addition, some consultants hold options to purchase our common stock, subject to the vesting requirements contained in the consulting agreements. Our consultants may be employed by other entities and therefore may have commitments to their employer, or may have other consulting or advisory agreements that may limit their availability to us.

  Competition 
         The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, including the study of telomeres, telomerase, our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry, and the research and development of therapies for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies. In addition, other products and therapies that could directly compete with imetelstat currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. 
         Many companies are developing alternative therapies to treat hematologic myeloid malignancies. For example, if approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against Incyte Corporation's ruxolitinib, or JakafiÂ®, which is orally administered. In clinical trials, JakafiÂ® reduced spleen size, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, bone pain, night sweats and itching in MF patients. Recently, there have also been reports of overall survival benefit as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis from JakafiÂ® treatment. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co-existing cytopenias, or low blood cell counts; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF-associated anemia include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide. There are other investigational treatments for MF further along in development than imetelstat, such as pacritinib by CTI Biopharma Corporation, or CTI Biopharma, and momelotinib by Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, which have reported results from Phase 3 clinical trials, and other inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway, such as NS-018 by NS Pharma, Inc., as well as several investigational treatments in early phase testing such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, interleukin-3 receptor targeted agents, inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, hypomethylating agents, PI3 Kinase and mTOR inhibitors, anti-fibrosis antibodies, hedgehog and SMO inhibitors, PIM kinase inhibitors, IAP inhibitors, anti-LOX2 inhibitors, recombinant pentraxin 2 protein, KIP-1 activators, TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, FLT inhibitors, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
         If approved for commercial sale for the treatment of lower risk MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of treatment options, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents and other hematopoietic growth factors; immunomodulators, such as lenalidomide by Celgene Corporation, or Celgene; hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine by Celgene and decitabine by Janssen; in addition to investigational treatments that may be further along in development than imetelstat, such as oral versions of azacitidine; histone deacetylase inhibitors; TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, such as luspatercept by Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; PI3 Kinase inhibitors; aminopeptidase inhibitors, such as tosedostat by CTI Biopharma; TLR2-specific antibodies; anti-CD33 antibodies; Fas ligand inhibitors; and JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors. 
         Independently, Janssen is developing therapies for hematologic malignancies, including AML, MDS, multiple myeloma and ABC-subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Molecular and cellular pathways of interest include:
 

Â cell surface targets for immune-directed therapy; 
Â immune checkpoint inhibition; 
Â leukemia stem cells; 
Â pathway addiction (genetic alterations, cell-type specific pathways); 
Â conditional sensitivity (stress, protein-producing tumors); 
Â targeting of T-cells and natural killer "NK" cells to tumors; 

 17

   

Â identification of novel tumor-specific antigens; and 
Â progression from early MDS to AML and cancer interception. 

 Success by Janssen in any of these approaches may compete with imetelstat or render imetelstat obsolete or noncompetitive, which could lead to a decision by Janssen to discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would materially and adversely affect our business and business prospects and might cause us to cease operations. 
         Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program. 
         In addition to the above factors, imetelstat will face competition based on:
 

Â product efficacy and safety; 
Â convenience of product administration; 
Â cost of manufacturing; 
Â the timing and scope of regulatory consents; 
Â status of reimbursement coverage; 
Â price; and 
Â patent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others. 

         As a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than us or Janssen. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their products below what Janssen may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third-party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost-effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   Government Regulation 
         Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of imetelstat, which is being developed in collaboration with Janssen. We anticipate that imetelstat will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, potential human therapeutic products, such as imetelstat, are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in European and other countries. Various governmental 
 18

   statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, import, export, distribution and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing. In collaboration with Janssen, the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled "Risks Related to Clinical and Commercialization Activities" under Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 
   United States Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Approval Process 
         Prior to commencement of clinical trials involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of a product candidate. The results of these trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. The FDA can place an IND on clinical hold at any time, which prevents the conduct of clinical trials under the IND until safety concerns are addressed by the IND sponsor to the FDA's satisfaction. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase trial process. In Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients afflicted with a specific disease to assess safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. The Phase 2 trials can be conducted comparing the investigational treatment to a comparator arm, or not. If used, a comparator usually includes standard of care therapy. Safety and efficacy data from Phase 2 clinical trials, even if favorable, may not provide sufficient rationale for proceeding to a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Phase 3, large scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to provide sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the trials. Human clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice regulations and applicable laws, with the oversight of Institutional Review Boards for the protection of human subjects. The manufacture of drug product candidates is subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices and applicable laws. 
         The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of drugs and complete manufacturing information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for review and for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. Submission of an NDA requires the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, which may be waived in certain cases. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may approve the drug for commercialization, impose limitations on its indications for use and labeling, including in the form of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or may issue a complete response letter. Even if an NDA is approved, its sponsor is subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory compliance requirements. 
   European and Other Regulatory Approval Process 
         Prior to initiating clinical trials in a region outside of the United States, a clinical trial application must be submitted and reviewed by the appropriate regulatory authority regulating the country in which the trial will be conducted. Whether or not FDA clearance or approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been cleared or approved by the FDA or 
 19

   another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union, or EU, and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Medicine Agency, or EMA, and the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, or CPMP, provide a mechanism for EU member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established the EMA for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized procedure with which the marketing authorization is recognized in all EU member states and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries. 
   Orphan Drug Designation 
         For a drug to qualify for orphan drug designation by the FDA, both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act, or ODA, and FDA's implementing regulations. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA's Office of Orphan Drug Products in order to support development of medicines for underserved or rare diseases and patient populations that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the ODA, including, if regulatory approval is received, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity with certain limited exceptions and certain tax credits for qualified clinical testing. A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for a disease or condition other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was granted orphan drug designation. The granting of orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. The safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. 
         On June 11, 2015 and December 23, 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, respectively. 
         Orphan drug designation by the European Commission provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, and where no satisfactory treatment is available. In the EU, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, as well as protocol assistance from the EMA during the product development phase, and direct access to the centralized authorization procedure. In addition, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug product approval, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in the EU. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable to not justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
         On November 15, 2015, the EMA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF.

     Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations 
         We may also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These additional healthcare regulations could affect our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician payment sunshine laws. 
         The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act or ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation. 
         Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. 
         The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
         HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, require certain types of individuals and entities to protect the privacy, security, and electronic exchange of certain patient data. 
         The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. 
         Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services 
 21

   reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Further, we may be subject to state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, administrative or civil penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
   Reimbursement and Health Reform 
         Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for imetelstat. 
         In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Janssen may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of imetelstat, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, imetelstat may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. 
         Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable Janssen to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on Janssen's and our investment in imetelstat. 
         The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted legislative and regulatory proposals to contain healthcare costs, as well as to improve quality and expand access. For example, in March 2010, the ACA, was signed into law that included a number of provisions of importance to the biopharmaceutical industry. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump 
 22

   signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. 
         We expect that other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for imetelstat. 
         In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers.

        RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 
  We have exclusively outlicensed imetelstat, which was our sole product candidate, to Janssen. We are wholly dependent upon our collaborative relationship with Janssen to further develop, manufacture and commercialize imetelstat. If Janssen fails to perform as required by the Collaboration Agreement or abandons the imetelstat program, the potential for us to generate future revenues from milestone payments and royalties from imetelstat would be significantly reduced, the development and/or commercialization of imetelstat could be terminated or substantially delayed, and our business would be severely harmed. 
         Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Janssen have created a joint governance structure, including joint committees and working groups, to oversee and manage worldwide regulatory, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for imetelstat; however, Janssen is solely responsible for the operational execution of those activities. Accordingly, the timely and successful completion by Janssen of those activities will significantly affect the timing and amount of any revenues from milestone payments and royalties we may receive under the Collaboration Agreement, and these activities will be influenced by, among other things, the efforts and allocation of resources by Janssen, none of which we control. If Janssen does not perform in the manner we expect or fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner, including with respect to conducting future additional or further data reviews of IMbark or IMerge, or at all, the clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and/or commercialization of imetelstat could be delayed or terminated, and it could become necessary for us to assume responsibility for the clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and/or commercialization of imetelstat at our own expense. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the development, regulatory or sales milestones under the Collaboration Agreement will be achieved or that we will receive any future milestone or royalty payments under the Collaboration Agreement. 
         In addition, because Janssen is solely responsible for the operational execution of worldwide regulatory, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities related to imetelstat, we are solely dependent on Janssen to provide us with timely and accurate information concerning these activities as well as information about the costs incurred under the Collaboration Agreement. If we do not receive accurate information from Janssen in a timely manner, or at all, regarding these activities, including, for example, plans for, and enrollment of, and efficacy and safety results from, clinical trials of imetelstat, then the timeliness and accuracy of our public disclosures, as well as our governance-related decision-making regarding these activities, may be adversely affected. 
         Our collaboration with Janssen may be unsuccessful due to other factors, including the following:
 

Â Janssen may choose to terminate the Collaboration Agreement for any reason; 
Â Janssen may provide a negative Continuation Decision and halt its development of imetelstat, in which case we would receive no further payments
from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement; 
Â Janssen may believe that any preliminary or final results of IMbark and/or IMerge, including in connection with the second internal data
reviews of these trials, are negative under the criteria set forth in the respective protocols, are inconclusive, or do not otherwise demonstrate adequate efficacy or clinical benefit to warrant
further development or commercialization of imetelstat by Janssen, which would likely result in a termination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen at any time, or a negative Continuation
Decision; 
Â Janssen may observe safety issues in either IMbark and/or IMerge, or any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, which may result in a
termination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen at any time, or a negative Continuation Decision; 

 26

   

Â Janssen may choose not to develop and commercialize imetelstat in certain, or any, markets or for one or more indications, if at all; 
Â Janssen may take considerably more time advancing imetelstat through the clinical and regulatory process than we currently anticipate, which
could materially delay the achievement of milestones and, consequently the receipt of milestone payments from Janssen, and ultimately, any royalties we might receive on worldwide net sales of
imetelstat; 
Â in the event of a dispute between us and Janssen regarding Janssen's performance under the Collaboration Agreement, it may be difficult or
impossible for us to prove that Janssen breached its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, including the obligation to use "commercially reasonable efforts" with regard to the development,
regulatory approval, manufacture and commercialization of imetelstat under the Collaboration Agreement; 
Â Janssen may not dedicate the resources necessary to carry imetelstat through clinical development or may not obtain the necessary regulatory
approvals for imetelstat, and this would delay or preclude the achievement of development, regulatory or sales milestones under the Collaboration Agreement; 
Â Janssen may be unable to obtain regulatory clearance to develop or commercialize imetelstat for sale in the United States and other countries,
in a timely manner, or at all, or such regulatory clearance may be revoked or put on hold by governmental or regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction; 
Â Janssen's ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize imetelstat may be delayed or substantially impacted if we are unable to provide to
Janssen in a timely manner, or at all, data or results from studies of imetelstat conducted by us and others prior to the Collaboration Agreement, or other information, related to imetelstat that may
be requested by Janssen; 
Â subject to our election of the U.S. Co-Promotion Option, Janssen will be responsible for all aspects of the commercialization of imetelstat
worldwide, including pricing decisions which would affect the royalties on worldwide net sales we could receive; 
Â Janssen may change the focus of its commercialization efforts or prioritize other programs more highly and, accordingly, reduce the efforts and
resources allocated to imetelstat, which might delay or halt the commercialization of imetelstat, and would have the direct effect of reducing our royalties or share of potential co-promotion
activities since the extent of our U.S. Co-Promotion Option is limited to a percentage of overall promotion activities under the Collaboration Agreement; 
Â Janssen may fail to manufacture or supply sufficient quantities of imetelstat or other clinical trial materials for use in current and/or
planned clinical trials, which could delay, suspend or stop any imetelstat clinical activities; 
Â Janssen may fail to develop a commercially viable formulation or manufacturing process for imetelstat, and may fail to manufacture or supply
sufficient quantities of imetelstat for commercial use, if approved, which would result in lost sales revenue and reduced royalties for us; 
Â Janssen may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements or may fail to report safety data from clinical trials of imetelstat in
accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could delay, suspend or stop clinical activities of imetelstat being performed by Janssen or by us; and 

 27

   

Â if Janssen is acquired by a third party during the term of our collaboration with Janssen, the acquirer may have different strategic priorities
that could cause it to terminate the Collaboration Agreement or reduce its commitment to our collaboration. 

 If our collaboration with Janssen is unsuccessful as a result of any of the above factors, or any other factors, then Janssen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement or cease its efforts to develop, manufacture or commercialize imetelstat, and we would not be eligible for any further payments from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, which would adversely impact our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and could cause us to cease operations. 
   Clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes. Current clinical trials of imetelstat being conducted by Janssen, including IMbark, IMerge and the Pilot Study, and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of imetelstat, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization, negatively affect our ability to earn revenues from milestone payments or royalties under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen and could result in termination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen. 
         Before regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of imetelstat can be obtained, clinical testing must be conducted to show that imetelstat is both safe and effective for use in each target indication. Such clinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete, and is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during clinical testing. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as commercial products. 
         The clinical development of imetelstat will be influenced by results from current clinical trials being conducted by Janssen, including IMbark, IMerge and the Pilot Study, and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. The advancement of current clinical trials of imetelstat and commencement of potential future clinical trials of imetelstat could be delayed or abandoned for a variety of reasons, including as a result of failures or delays by Janssen in:
 

Â obtaining or maintaining regulatory clearance to continue to conduct current clinical trials being conducted by Janssen, including IMbark,
IMerge and the Pilot Study, or obtaining or maintaining regulatory clearance to commence, conduct or continue to conduct potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, in a timely manner, or at all,
in the United States or other countries; 
Â maintaining the INDs for imetelstat without such INDs being placed on full or partial clinical hold by the FDA; 
Â properly designing, enrolling, conducting or completing IMbark, IMerge and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and promptly or
adequately reporting data from such trials; 
Â demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy of imetelstat in IMbark, IMerge and potential future clinical trials without safety issues, side
effects or dose-limiting toxicities, including any additional or more severe safety issues in addition to those that have been observed to date in previous or ongoing clinical trials related to
imetelstat, whether or not in the same indications or therapeutic areas; 
Â properly conducting and/or completing the Pilot Study and promptly or adequately reporting data from such trial; 
Â obtaining or accessing necessary clinical data in accordance with appropriate clinical or quality practices to ensure complete data sets; 
Â responding to safety or futility findings by the data review committees of current clinical trials, including IMbark, IMerge and the Pilot
Study, and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, based on emerging data occurring during such clinical trials, such as significant systemic or organ 

 28

   

toxicities,
including hepatotoxicity, fatal bleeding, or other safety issues, including patient injury or death, resulting in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile; 


Â manufacturing sufficient quantities of imetelstat or other clinical trial materials in a manner that meets the quality standards of the FDA and
other regulatory authorities, and responding to any disruptions to drug supply, clinical trial materials or quality issues that may arise; 
Â ensuring the ability to manufacture imetelstat at acceptable costs for potential Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization; 
Â obtaining sufficient quantities of any study-related treatments, materials (including comparator products, placebo or combination therapies) or
ancillary supplies; 
Â obtaining acceptance by regulatory authorities of manufacturing changes, as well as subsequently implementing such manufacturing changes
successfully; 
Â complying with current and future regulatory requirements, policies or guidelines, including domestic and international laws and regulations
pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency, and the privacy and security of health information; 
Â reaching agreement on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, if at all, with collaborators and vendors located in the United States or foreign
jurisdictions, including contract research organizations, laboratory service providers and clinical trial sites, on all aspects of clinical development; 
Â obtaining timely review and approval by regulatory authorities of protocol amendments which may be sought for IMbark, IMerge and potential
future clinical trials of imetelstat; and 
Â obtaining institutional review board or ethics committee approval of clinical trial protocols or protocol amendments, including the recent
protocol amendment for IMbark, to conduct clinical trials at existing or prospective clinical trial sites. 

 Failures or delays with respect to any of these events could adversely affect Janssen's ability to maintain or successfully complete any current clinical trials of imetelstat or to initiate potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, which could increase development costs, delay the timing of the Continuation Decision from Janssen, impair our ability to earn revenues from milestone payments or royalties under the Collaboration Agreement or cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, any of which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
         For example, to inform an assessment of the appropriate dose and schedule of imetelstat for relapsed or refractory MF patients in IMbark, in the third quarter of 2016, Janssen conducted a planned internal interim review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data from 20 patients from each dosing arm who had been followed on the trial for at least 12 weeks. Based on this first internal review at the 12-week time point, Janssen determined to close the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm to new patient enrollment and to suspend enrollment in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm because an insufficient number of patients met the protocol defined interim efficacy criteria at 12 weeks. 
         In the first quarter of 2017, Janssen initiated the process to conduct a second internal data review of IMbark that is expected to include patients enrolled in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm as a starting dose who have been followed for at least 24 weeks. It is possible that, as a result of the second internal review, Janssen could decide to terminate the trial and/or the Collaboration Agreement altogether. Even if Janssen decides to continue the trial, either by resuming enrollment in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm, with or without changes to the dosing regimen, or adding a new dosing arm or otherwise, the development of imetelstat could be substantially delayed. 
 29

           Due to the current suspension of enrollment in IMbark, the timing of the protocol-specified primary analysis for the trial is now uncertain and may be substantially delayed due to numerous factors, including whether patient enrollment resumes in the trial, or the protocol-specified primary analysis may not occur at all if IMbark is terminated early based on preliminary data, safety concerns or for any other reason, any of which could increase our development costs, delay the timing of the Continuation Decision from Janssen, impair our ability to earn revenues from milestone payments or royalties under the Collaboration Agreement or cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   If Janssen encounters difficulties enrolling or retaining patients in current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, clinical development and commercialization activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected, which could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, and our business would be severely harmed. 
         The timely completion of a clinical trial in accordance with its protocol depends, among other things, on the ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. Janssen may experience difficulties in patient enrollment or retention in IMbark and IMerge, or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat for a variety of reasons. The enrollment and retention of patients depends on many factors, including:
 

Â the patient eligibility criteria in the protocol; 
Â the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial's primary endpoint; 
Â the proximity of patients to study sites; 
Â the design of the trial; 
Â Janssen's ability to recruit and retain clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience; 
Â clinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the potential advantages of imetelstat in relation to other available therapies, including any new
drugs that may be approved for the indications being investigated; 
Â the ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and 
Â the risk that patients enrolled in the clinical trial will drop out of the trial before completion due to lack of efficacy, side effects,
enrollment suspension, investigator decision, or personal issues. 

         In addition, IMbark and IMerge compete, and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat will compete, with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas with imetelstat, and this competition will reduce the number and type of patients available to enroll in the imetelstat clinical trials. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, IMbark and IMerge are being conducted, and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat are expected to be conducted, at the same clinical trial sites that competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for the imetelstat clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Moreover, because imetelstat represents a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, rather than enroll patients into the imetelstat clinical trials. 
         Delays in patient enrollment or the inability to retain or treat patients could result in increased costs, lead to incomplete data sets or adversely affect the timing or outcome of IMbark and IMerge, or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect the clinical development and commercialization of imetelstat, either of which would delay the 
 30

   timing of the Continuation Decision from Janssen or could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement. Such occurrences would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   Imetelstat may cause, or have attributed to it, undesirable or unintended side effects or other characteristics that delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of clinical trials for imetelstat, delay or prevent its regulatory approval, or limit its commercial potential, which in each case could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement and which in turn would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
         Imetelstat may cause, or have attributed to it, undesirable or unintended side effects or other characteristics adversely affecting its safety or efficacy that could delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of current or potential future clinical trials for imetelstat. In our Phase 1 clinical trials of imetelstat, we observed dose-limiting toxicities, including thrombocytopenia, when imetelstat was used as a single agent, and neutropenia when imetelstat was used in combination with paclitaxel, as well as a low incidence of severe infusion reactions. In our Phase 2 clinical trials of imetelstat in ET, multiple myeloma, and solid tumors, we observed hematologic toxicities as well as gastrointestinal events, infections, muscular and joint pain, fatigue and infusion reactions. In addition, in our Phase 2 clinical trials of imetelstat, we observed liver function test, or LFT, abnormalities, the clinical significance and long-term consequences of which are currently undetermined. In the ET Trial, one patient died of bleeding esophageal varices, a complication of chronic liver disease, for which imetelstat initially could not be excluded as a causative agent but which was later determined by the investigator to be unrelated to imetelstat. In the Pilot Study, cytopenias have been the primary dose-limiting toxicity reported to date, consistent with our observations in previous Geron-sponsored imetelstat studies. However, during the Pilot Study, more persistent and profound cytopenias, particularly thrombocytopenia, were observed with imetelstat administered on a weekly basis. This included one case of febrile neutropenia after prolonged myelosuppression with intracranial hemorrhage resulting in patient death, which was assessed as possibly related to imetelstat by the investigator. In addition, adverse events previously observed in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study, such as LFT abnormalities, profound and prolonged thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, bleeding events, and other safety issues, including death, have also been observed by Janssen in IMbark and IMerge. If patients in current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat experience similar or more severe adverse events, including LFT abnormalities, or severe hepatic, hemorrhagic, or new or unusual adverse events, the INDs for imetelstat may again be placed on clinical hold, as it was in March 2014, and Janssen may be delayed or precluded from further developing imetelstat. 
         Serious adverse events observed in clinical trials could delay or prevent any regulatory approvals of imetelstat or could hinder or prevent market acceptance of imetelstat, which could cause Janssen to delay the timing of the Continuation Decision, terminate the Collaboration Agreement or cause Janssen to limit its commercialization of imetelstat to certain indications. Such occurrences would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   If Janssen does not elect to continue the development of imetelstat in a timely manner, or at all, our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, and we might cease operations. 
         Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is not obligated to make any additional payments to us until it makes an affirmative Continuation Decision following the protocol-specified primary analysis of IMbark, or, if IMbark is terminated early, or placed on clinical hold or suspended by a regulatory authority for an extended period of time, within approximately 24 months after the initiation of IMerge. The timing of Janssen's Continuation Decision also affects the timing and our opportunity to make our decision regarding our U.S. Opt-In Rights, as well as our election, if we 
 31

   exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights, of our U.S. Co-Promotion Option. If IMbark is terminated early, placed on clinical hold or suspended by a regulatory authority for an extended period of time, or is otherwise unsuccessful, Janssen may delay the timing of the Continuation Decision or provide a negative Continuation Decision, in which case, the Collaboration Agreement would terminate, we would not be eligible for any further payments from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement and our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, would be severely and adversely affected, which might cause us to cease operations. 
         In addition, Janssen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time for convenience. If Janssen terminates the Collaboration Agreement, then, depending on the timing of such event:
 

Â we would no longer have the right to receive any milestone payments or royalties under the Collaboration Agreement; 
Â the development of imetelstat would be significantly delayed or terminated; 
Â we would bear all of the risks and costs related to any further clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and commercialization
of imetelstat; 
Â we would need to raise additional capital if we were to choose to pursue imetelstat development on our own, or we would need to establish
alternative collaborations with third parties, which might not be possible in a timely manner, or at all, or might not be possible on terms acceptable to us, in which case it would likely be necessary
for us to limit the size or scope of the imetelstat development program or to seek additional funding by other means to accommodate the increased expenditures; and 
Â we would need to hire additional qualified employees to support the development and commercialization of imetelstat, which may take significant
amounts of time, may not be feasible, and which would increase our need for additional funding. 

 Any termination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen at any time would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   Failure by Janssen to manufacture or provide adequate clinical and commercial quantities of imetelstat on a timely basis, or at all, would result in a delay of clinical trials or regulatory approvals, or lost sales, and our business and business prospects could be severely harmed. 
         In accordance with the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is responsible for the manufacture and management of the supply of imetelstat on a global basis for all clinical trials and commercial activities. Consequently, we are, and expect to remain, dependent on Janssen to appropriately supply imetelstat and other clinical trial materials. The process of manufacturing imetelstat is complex and subject to several risks, including:
 

Â the ability to scale-up and attain sufficient production yields with appropriate quality control and quality assurance; 
Â reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers; 
Â supply chain issues, including the timely availability and shelf life requirements of raw materials and other supplies; 
Â shortage of qualified personnel; and 
Â compliance with regulatory requirements, which are less well-defined for oligonucleotide products than for small molecule drugs and vary in
each country where imetelstat might be sold or used. 

 32



As a result of these risks, Janssen may not perform as agreed or may default in its obligations to supply imetelstat or other clinical trial materials for clinical trials and/or commercial activities. Janssen also may fail to deliver the required quantities of imetelstat or other clinical trial materials on a timely basis, or at required or applicable quality standards. Any such failure by Janssen could delay current and/or potential future clinical trials and any applications for regulatory approval and therefore delay the payment of potential milestone payments to us, or, if approved for commercial sale, could impair Janssen's ability to meet the market demand for imetelstat and therefore result in decreased sales and reduced royalties for us which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   If Janssen makes an affirmative Continuation Decision under the Collaboration Agreement, our decision to exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights must thereafter be made within a short timeframe and, as a result, we may be required to invest substantial capital based on limited clinical data and information. 
         If Janssen makes an affirmative Continuation Decision under the Collaboration Agreement, we must decide whether to elect to exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights within a short timeframe following such a decision, and although we expect to receive information from Janssen regarding data from IMbark and IMerge, proposed future clinical development plans and costs for imetelstat, estimates in timing for commercializing imetelstat and related promotional activities, and a calculation of our share of development costs incurred to date by Janssen that we will be required to reimburse if we exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights, we will be required to rapidly decide whether to make a substantial capital investment in imetelstat prior to the conclusion of any Phase 3 registration-enabling clinical trial. Accordingly, if we exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights and imetelstat were to become unsuccessful in any Phase 3 registration-enabling clinical trial or were to fail to receive regulatory approval, we would not receive any financial return on this substantial capital investment. Such an occurrence would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire and/or in-license other oncology products, product candidates, programs or companies to grow and diversify our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any such products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these licenses or acquisitions. 
         We have exclusively outlicensed imetelstat, which was our sole product candidate, to Janssen. Accordingly, we are relying exclusively upon our collaborative relationship with Janssen to further develop, manufacture and commercialize imetelstat. To grow and diversify our business, we plan to continue our business development efforts to identify and seek to acquire and/or in-license other oncology products, product candidates, programs or companies. Such efforts have not yet resulted in any transaction, and may never result in a transaction. Future growth through acquisition or in-licensing will depend upon the availability of suitable products, product candidates, programs or companies for acquisition or in-licensing on acceptable prices, terms and conditions. Even if appropriate opportunities are available, we may not be able to acquire rights to them on acceptable terms, or at all. The competition to acquire or in-license rights to promising products, product candidates, programs and companies is fierce, and many of our competitors are large, multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with considerably more financial, development and commercialization resources, personnel, and experience than we have. In order to compete successfully in the current business climate, we may have to pay higher prices for assets than may have been paid historically, which may make it more difficult for us to realize an adequate return on any acquisition. In addition, even if we succeed in identifying promising products, product candidates, programs or companies, we may not have the ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize such opportunities, or the financial resources necessary to pursue them. 
 33

           Even if we are able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license new products, product candidates, programs or companies, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or the risks arising from anticipated and unanticipated problems in connection with an acquisition or in-licensing. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of potential acquisitions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties effectively would have a material adverse effect on our business. In any event, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or in-licensing for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that a product candidate fails to advance to clinical development, proves not to be safe or effective in clinical trials, a product fails to reach its forecasted commercial potential or the integration of a product, product candidate, program or company gives rise to unforeseen difficulties and expenditures. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
         In addition, acquisitions create other uncertainties and risks, particularly when the acquisition takes the form of a merger or other business consolidation. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with transition activities and integration efforts, which include:
 

Â high acquisition costs; 
Â the need to incur substantial debt or engage in dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions; 
Â the potential disruption of our historical business and our activities under the Collaboration Agreement; 
Â the strain on, and need to expand, our existing operational, technical, financial and administrative infrastructure; 
Â our lack of experience in late-stage product development and commercialization; 
Â the difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures; 
Â the difficulties in hiring qualified personnel and establishing necessary development and/or commercialization capabilities; 
Â the failure to retain key management and other personnel; 
Â the challenges in controlling additional costs and expenses in connection with and as a result of the acquisition; 
Â the need to write down assets or recognize impairment charges; 
Â the diversion of our management's attention to integration of operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures; and 
Â any unanticipated liabilities for activities of or related to the acquired business or its operations, products or product candidates. 

         If we fail to integrate or otherwise manage an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, resulting operating inefficiencies could increase our costs more than we planned, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and could otherwise distract us from execution of our strategy. Failure to maintain effective financial controls and reporting systems and procedures could also impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements. 
         In addition, the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen prohibits us from commercializing, under the intellectual property we have licensed exclusively to Janssen, any substance whose identified or 
 34

   known mechanism of action is telomerase inhibition. Further, if we exercise our U.S. Co-Promotion Option under the Collaboration Agreement, we will be required to certify to Janssen at the time of exercising our U.S. Co-Promotion Option that we are not marketing or promoting, and have no right to market or promote, any such products for any oncology indication. Our right to co-promote in the United States may be terminated by Janssen if we develop or commercialize a product for treating an oncology indication that acts through the same mechanism of action as imetelstat or that is substitutable for imetelstat. Accordingly, our Collaboration Agreement with Janssen could adversely affect our ability to acquire or in-license, or to research, develop or market, promising products, product candidates or programs. 
   We may be unable to successfully retain key personnel to support our collaboration with Janssen or to manage any future growth. 
         Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Janssen have created a joint governance structure, including joint committees and working groups, to manage worldwide regulatory, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for imetelstat, and we have ongoing responsibilities to oversee and participate in the collaboration with Janssen. In addition, we remain responsible for prosecuting, at Janssen's direction, the patents we exclusively licensed to Janssen, and have sole responsibility for those patents that were non-exclusively licensed to Janssen. If we are unable to successfully retain, motivate and incentivize our personnel, our ability to support the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen could be impaired, and our business and the price of our common stock would be adversely impacted. 
         In addition, our future growth and success depend to a significant extent on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our staff. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and other research institutions. The previous restructurings we implemented, as well as the fact that we exclusively outlicensed imetelstat, which was our sole product candidate, to Janssen, and the uncertainties regarding our ability to diversify our business could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel or we may incur unanticipated inefficiencies caused by our reduced personnel resources. We may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract or assimilate other highly qualified management and development personnel in the future on acceptable terms. The loss of any or all of these individuals could harm our business and could impair our ability to support our collaboration with Janssen or to support future growth. 
   We are involved in securities-related legal actions that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
         Securities-related class action lawsuits and/or derivative lawsuits have often been brought against companies which experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their product development programs. 
         We and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in two purported class action securities lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, or the California District Court, as well as a third securities lawsuit, not styled as a class action, which was originally filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, but subsequently transferred to the California District Court. These three cases, or the Class Action Lawsuits, which are based on the same factual background, have been consolidated for all purposes, and are currently stayed to enable the parties to seek to resolve them. On November 23, 2016, the parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding that set forth material deal points of resolving the Class Action Lawsuits. On December 13, 2016, the parties filed a notice of settlement, which the California District Court signed on December 16, 2016, staying the Class Action Lawsuits pending final 
 35

   approval of a settlement. Final settlement of the Class Action Lawsuits is contingent upon, among other things, approval by the California District Court. Such approval, if any, is not expected until the end of 2017. 
         Certain of our officers and directors were also named as defendants in four purported stockholder derivative lawsuits, two of which were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo, or the San Mateo County Court, and two of which were filed in the California District Court. These cases were all based on the same factual background and were consolidated in their respective courts. On July 22, 2016, the parties entered into a stipulation to settle all claims in each of the foregoing derivative lawsuits in exchange for our agreement to (i) implement certain corporate governance refinements, and (ii) instruct our insurer to pay in full the plaintiffs' attorneys a total of $950,000. On August 19, 2016, the San Mateo County Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement. On November 18, 2016, the San Mateo County Court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement and dismissing with prejudice the two derivative lawsuits filed in the San Mateo County Court. On December 6, 2016, the California District Court issued an order dismissing with prejudice the two derivative lawsuits filed in the California District Court. Accordingly, as of December 6, 2016, all of the derivative lawsuits have been fully and finally settled and dismissed. 
         For a more complete discussion of the Class Action Lawsuits and the derivative lawsuits, see the section entitled "Legal Proceedings" under Item 3. 
         It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from stockholders naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants with respect to these same or other matters, including, for example, allegations related to the duration and nature of follow-up conducted by Janssen or us of patients enrolled in current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, the nature and timing of our disclosures related to efficacy or safety data observed in current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, or serious adverse events encountered in current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the implementation of the corporate governance refinements required by the terms of the settlement for the derivative lawsuits, or in the settlement or defense of the Class Action Lawsuits or any additional lawsuits, and we may not prevail in such lawsuits. We have not established any reserve for any potential liability relating to any additional lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests in any such lawsuit, or in similar or related litigation, could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. 
   We may be subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome. 
         Our business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors, or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships, or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us. 
         For example, as a result of possible disagreements with Janssen, we may become involved in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. Possible disagreements with Janssen could include disagreements regarding the development and/or commercialization of imetelstat, interpretation of the Collaboration Agreement and ownership of proprietary rights. In addition, in certain circumstances we may believe that a particular milestone under the Collaboration Agreement has been achieved, and Janssen may disagree with our belief. In that case, receipt of that milestone payment may be delayed or may never be received, which would adversely affect our financial condition and may require us to adjust our operating plans. While the Collaboration Agreement provides for a joint governance structure to oversee and manage worldwide regulatory, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for imetelstat, Janssen generally will, subject to limited exceptions, 
 36

   have the deciding vote in the event of any disagreement. In any event, the joint governance structure contemplated by the Collaboration Agreement will be dissolved in the event that Janssen makes a Continuation Decision, but we do not exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights, which would preclude our ability to participate in any further decision-making for imetelstat. Reliance on a joint governance structure also subjects us to the risk that changes in key Janssen management personnel that are members of the various joint committees may materially and adversely affect the functioning of these committees, which could significantly delay or preclude imetelstat development and/or commercialization. 
         Monitoring, initiating and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management, likely to be expensive and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. In addition, despite the availability of insurance, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with litigation. Lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and defense and disposition costs depend upon many unknown factors. Lawsuits could result in judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities, or otherwise negatively affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, the inherent uncertainty of such litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price and a decrease in the value of our stockholders' investment in our common stock. 
   We may also be subject to litigation arising from completed strategic transactions or if the results of our business and collaboration activities are not successful. 
         On November 13, 2014, we announced that we had entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide. We may face litigation arising from or related to the Collaboration Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, including if we are unable to generate substantial value under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen or such collaboration is otherwise unsuccessful. 
         The Collaboration Agreement could result in litigation arising out of any claims that our stockholders suffered financial losses due to the transaction, the approval of our stockholders was required under applicable law or otherwise should have been obtained prior to the completion of the transaction, or that our officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the approval and completion of the transaction. Although we believe that stockholder approval was not required under applicable law in order to complete our transaction with Janssen, and therefore we neither sought nor intend to seek such stockholder approval, it is possible that persons who were stockholders at the time of the applicable transaction may claim that their approval was required, in which case litigation could follow, which could result in substantial damages to us and/or could negatively affect our rights and obligations, or result in the termination of, the Collaboration Agreement. 
         Likewise, our stockholders may believe that the financial and other terms of the Collaboration Agreement are not favorable to either us or our stockholders, including any belief that the potential payments we may receive under the Collaboration Agreement are inadequate. Litigation brought by our stockholders challenging the validity of, or financial losses resulting from, these transactions could also result in claims against us by Janssen, and the Collaboration Agreement provides for indemnification by us of Janssen against all losses and expenses relating to breaches of our representations, warranties and covenants in the Collaboration Agreement, which could expose us to further financial obligations and damages. The occurrence of any one or more of the above could have a significant adverse impact on our business and financial condition. 
         In addition, if the results of our business and collaboration activities are not successful, including without limitation, if our Collaboration Agreement with Janssen is terminated or is otherwise unsuccessful, then our stock price would decline significantly, and future litigation may result. A 
 37

   decision adverse to our interests in any such lawsuits could result in the payment of substantial damages by us, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition or could otherwise severely harm our business. 
      RISKS RELATED TO CLINICAL AND COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES 
  The research and development of imetelstat is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. 
         The science and technology of telomere biology, telomerase and our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry are relatively new. There is no precedent for the successful commercialization of a therapeutic product candidate based on these technologies. Significant research and development activities will be necessary to further develop imetelstat, which was our sole product candidate that we have exclusively outlicensed to Janssen, which may take years to accomplish, if at all. 
         Because of the significant scientific, regulatory and commercial challenges that must be overcome to successfully research, develop and commercialize imetelstat, the development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including MF and MDS, or any other indications, may be delayed or abandoned, even after significant resources have been expended on it. Examples of such decisions include the discontinuation of our Phase 2 clinical trial of imetelstat in metastatic breast cancer in September 2012, the discontinuation our development of imetelstat in solid tumors with short telomeres in April 2013, and Janssen's determinations in the third quarter of 2016 to close the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark to new patient enrollment and to suspend enrollment in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark because an insufficient number of patients in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm met the protocol defined interim efficacy criteria at 12 weeks. Any further delay, suspension or abandonment of the development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies would have a material adverse effect on our collaboration with Janssen, which could result in the termination of the Collaboration Agreement. Any of these events would have severe adverse effects on the future of imetelstat and our business prospects and likely result in the failure of our business. 
   Success in early clinical trials may not be predictive or indicative of results in current ongoing clinical trials or potential future clinical trials. Likewise, preliminary data from clinical trials should be considered carefully and with caution since the final data may be materially different from the preliminary data, particularly as more patient data become available. 
         A number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in preclinical studies and initial clinical trials, but subsequently fail to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals to initiate commercial sale of a drug. There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired benefit-risk profile despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. 
         Data from our preclinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Pilot Study, as well as the results of the initial internal interim data reviews conducted by Janssen in the third quarter of 2016 for IMbark and IMerge, should not be relied upon as predictive or indicative of future clinical results, including any final results in the Pilot Study, IMbark or IMerge or the results in potential subsequent or larger-scale clinical trials of imetelstat. The results we obtained from the ET Trial and the Pilot Study and the results obtained by Janssen in the initial internal interim data reviews conducted by Janssen for IMbark and IMerge, as well as any future results that may be obtained by Janssen from IMbark and IMerge, may not predict the future therapeutic benefit of imetelstat, if any, in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including MF and MDS. In addition, the known LFT abnormalities and dose-limiting toxicities associated with imetelstat, such as profound and 
 38

   prolonged thrombocytopenia and neutropenia and other safety issues, including death, that have been observed in both previous Geron-sponsored clinical trials and investigator-sponsored clinical trials, including in the Pilot Study, have also been observed in the internal interim data reviews conducted by Janssen of IMbark and IMerge. Since remaining patients previously enrolled in the Pilot Study, as well as patients currently enrolled in IMbark and IMerge, continue to receive imetelstat, safety data continue to be generated, and additional and updated data may materially change the overall conclusions from the preliminary data reported for the Pilot Study, as well as determinations made by Janssen based on its initial internal reviews of data for IMbark and IMerge. If additional, new or more severe adverse events occur in current imetelstat clinical trials, including the Pilot Study, IMbark and IMerge, such trials could be discontinued by Janssen or the IND for imetelstat may again be placed on clinical hold, as it was in March 2014. Also, the criteria used to assess efficacy in the Pilot Study have not been validated for clinical use and may not be considered by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to be accurate predictors of efficacy for different endpoints that may be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for Phase 3 clinical trials. 
         In addition, from time-to-time, preliminary or interim data from current clinical trials, such as the ongoing Pilot Study, IMbark and IMerge, or potential future clinical trials may be reported or announced by Janssen, its investigators, or us. For example, preliminary results of the Pilot Study were presented by the investigator at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting in December 2013, and updated by the investigator at ASH in December 2014, and preliminary data were reported by the investigator from a cohort of MDS patients in the Pilot Study in December 2015. Since such data are preliminary, the final data from any protocol-specified primary analysis which may be conducted, or any future analyses of the Pilot Study, IMbark or IMerge, or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, may be materially different. Material adverse differences in the final data, compared to preliminary or interim data, from the Pilot Study, IMbark or IMerge, or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, could result in a decision by Janssen to discontinue the imetelstat program, delay its Continuation Decision, or terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. Even if final safety and/or efficacy data from the Pilot Study, IMbark or IMerge or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, are positive, significant additional clinical testing will be necessary to advance the future development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including MF or MDS. Preliminary or interim results from the Pilot Study, IMbark or IMerge reported by us, Janssen or by the investigator in the Pilot Study may not be reproduced in any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and thus should not be relied upon as indicative of future clinical results of imetelstat in MF, MDS or in any other hematologic myeloid malignancy. Preliminary or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution. 
   Clinical trials of imetelstat may not uncover all possible adverse effects that patients may experience from imetelstat treatment. 
         Clinical trials by their nature examine the effect of a potential therapy in a sample of the potential future patient population. As such, clinical trials conducted with imetelstat, to date and in the future, may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients treated with imetelstat may experience. Because previously enrolled patients who remain on study continue to receive imetelstat in the Pilot Study, additional or more severe toxicities or safety issues, including additional serious adverse events and clinically significant LFT abnormalities, may be observed in the Pilot Study as patient treatment continues and more data become available. Likewise, additional or more severe toxicities or safety issues, including additional serious adverse events and clinically significant LFT abnormalities, may be observed in IMbark and IMerge, particularly given the larger target patient enrollment in those studies. Since IMbark, IMerge and the Pilot Study are ongoing studies in which additional data are being generated, the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat will continue to be assessed, including the risk of hepatotoxicity, severe cytopenias, fatal bleeding and any other severe adverse effects that may be 
 39

   associated with life-threatening clinical outcomes. If such toxicities or other safety issues in any clinical trial of imetelstat result in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile, then:
 

Â the commencement, continuation and/or completion of any current ongoing clinical trials, including IMbark, IMerge and the Pilot Study, or
potential future clinical trials would likely be delayed, for example by being placed on a clinical hold, halted or prohibited; or 
Â additional, unexpected clinical trials or preclinical studies may be required to be conducted. 

 The occurrence of any of these events could cause Janssen to delay its Continuation Decision, or abandon the development of imetelstat entirely and terminate the Collaboration Agreement. Any termination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of which might cause us to cease operations. 
   Obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to develop and market imetelstat in the United States and other countries is a costly and lengthy process, and we cannot predict whether or when regulatory authorities will permit additional imetelstat development or approve imetelstat for commercial sale. 
         Federal, state and local governments in the United States and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern drug research and development and may prevent us, in collaboration with Janssen, from successfully conducting development efforts or from commercializing imetelstat. Imetelstat must receive all relevant regulatory approvals before it may be marketed in the United States or other countries. Obtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. For example in June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of exiting the European Union. Although the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will not be known for some time, this could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty in relation to the regulatory process in Europe, which could result in a delay in the review of regulatory submissions made in Europe by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and could also lead to less efficient, more expensive, and potentially lengthier regulatory review processes for companies, including us and Janssen, who may seek to obtain regulatory approval for drug products in the European Union or the United Kingdom. Likewise, the new Trump Administration has and will appoint and employ many new secretaries, directors and the like into positions of authority in the U.S. federal government dealing with the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries that may potentially have a negative impact on the prices and the regulatory pathways for pharmaceuticals. Such changes could adversely affect and/or delay the ability of Janssen to obtain approval of, and market and sell, imetelstat in the United States. In addition, because imetelstat involves the application of new technologies and a new therapeutic approach, it may be subject to substantial additional review by various government regulatory authorities, and, as a result, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for imetelstat may proceed more slowly than for product candidates based upon more conventional technologies, and any approval that may be received could limit the use of imetelstat. We do not expect imetelstat to be approved for commercial sale for many years, if at all. 
         Prior to initiating potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, clinical trial protocols must be submitted to the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. Questions or comments regarding protocols for potential future clinical trials of imetelstat from these agencies that must be addressed would likely delay further clinical development of imetelstat which could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. Similarly, questions or comments from regulatory authorities on any protocol amendments of IMbark or IMerge, could potentially delay the timing of any Continuation Decision by Janssen. 
         Before Janssen can seek to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of imetelstat, multiple clinical trials, including larger-scale Phase 3 clinical trials, will need to be conducted to 
 40

   demonstrate that imetelstat is safe and effective for use in a diverse population. If imetelstat cannot be developed in potential future clinical trials, including Phase 3 clinical trials, our Collaboration Agreement with Janssen will be negatively impacted and likely be terminated altogether, which would have severe adverse effects on our business and business prospects, and might result in the failure of our business. 
         If the interpretation by us or Janssen of safety and efficacy data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies varies from interpretations by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries, this would likely delay, limit or prevent further development and approval of imetelstat which may cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement. For example, the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries may require more or different data than what has been generated from our preclinical studies and previous or ongoing clinical trials, such as IMbark, IMerge or the Pilot Study. In addition, delays or rejections of regulatory approvals, or limitations in marketing authorizations, may be encountered as a result of changes in the regulatory environment or regulatory policy during the period of product development and/or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval for imetelstat. 
         The benefit-risk profile of imetelstat will also affect the assessment by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries of the drug's cost-effectiveness and/or marketability, which assessment could prevent or limit its approval for marketing and successful commercial use. If regulatory submissions requesting approval to market imetelstat are submitted, the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries may conclude that the overall benefit-risk profile of imetelstat treatment does not merit approval of imetelstat for marketing or further development for any indication. Any of these events could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely harm our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. 
         Delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals or limitations in the scope of such clearances or approvals could:
 

Â significantly harm the commercial potential of imetelstat; 
Â impose costly procedures upon future development activities; 
Â diminish any competitive advantages that may have been available; or 
Â adversely limit the amount of, or affect our ability to receive, any milestone payments or royalties under the Collaboration Agreement with
Janssen. 

         Even if the necessary time and resources are committed by Janssen, the required regulatory clearances and approvals may not be obtained for imetelstat. Further, if regulatory clearances and approvals are obtained to commence commercial sales of imetelstat, they may impose significant limitations on the indicated uses or other aspects of the product label for which imetelstat can be marketed. An approval might also be contingent on the performance of costly additional post-marketing clinical trials. The occurrence of any of these events could limit the potential commercial use of imetelstat, and therefore delay the payment of potential milestone payments to us, or, if approved for commercial sale, could reduce the market demand for imetelstat and therefore result in decreased sales and reduced royalties for us under the Collaboration Agreement. Occurrence of any of these events could negatively impact our collaboration with Janssen or cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.

  Although orphan drug designation has been granted to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, these designations may not be maintained, which would eliminate the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity, which would likely result in potential sales revenue for imetelstat, if any, to be reduced, and would likely harm our business and business prospects. 
         Although the FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat in June 2015 for the treatment of MF and for the treatment of MDS in December 2015, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted it in November 2015 for the treatment of MF, Janssen may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of a product candidate for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States or the European Union, if granted, may be limited if Janssen seeks approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or such marketing exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA later determines that the request for orphan drug designation was materially defective, or if Janssen is unable to ensure and provide sufficient quantities of imetelstat to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if Janssen obtains orphan drug exclusivity for imetelstat, that exclusivity may not effectively protect imetelstat from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug product is approved, the FDA or EMA can subsequently approve a different drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA or EMA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Occurrence of any of these events could result in decreased sales and reduced royalties for us, and may harm our business and business prospects. In addition, orphan drug designation will neither shorten the development time nor regulatory review time for imetelstat, and does not give imetelstat any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. 
   Failure to achieve continued compliance with government regulation could delay or halt commercialization of imetelstat, which we have exclusively outlicensed to Janssen. 
         Approved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including import restrictions, seizure and withdrawal of the product from the market. If approved for commercial sale, future sales of imetelstat will be subject to government regulation related to numerous matters, including the processes of:
 

Â manufacturing; 
Â advertising and promoting; 
Â selling and marketing; 
Â labeling; and 
Â distribution. 

 If, and to the extent that, we are or Janssen is unable to comply with these regulations, our ability to earn potential milestone payments and royalties from worldwide net sales of imetelstat would be materially and adversely impacted. 
         Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties, including but not limited to:
 

Â recall or seizure of products; 
Â injunctions against the import, manufacture, distribution, sales and/or marketing of products; and 
Â criminal prosecution. 

 42

   The imposition of any of these penalties or other commercial limitations could negatively impact our collaboration with Janssen or cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, either of which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   Any development activities conducted by Janssen under a Janssen Independent Development Plan, or IDP, may create significant reimbursement obligations for us, which could result in reduced cash inflow from future milestone payments and royalties until we have fully paid our reimbursement obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. 
         Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen may conduct certain development activities for imetelstat under a Janssen IDP, if we and Janssen agree that such activities should be performed outside of the mutually agreed global clinical development plan. Although Janssen would bear all of the costs for such Janssen IDP, if we exercised our U.S. Opt-In Rights and if any data from a Janssen IDP supports approval by a regulatory authority in the United States or other countries, then we would be required to reimburse Janssen for our share of the costs of that Janssen IDP plus a premium pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. This cost reimbursement is payable as a lump sum up to a certain threshold upon receipt of regulatory approval for the Janssen IDP. Any remaining amounts in excess of the threshold are payable in installments by offsetting milestone payments or royalties received by us over a certain period of time, at which time any remaining reimbursement amount would be payable in a lump sum. This payment mechanism could result in reduced cash inflow from future milestone payments and royalties, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
   Under the Collaboration Agreement, if we develop imetelstat independently under our own IDP, the success of that IDP depends on our ability to provide adequate financial and technical resources. 
         Under the Collaboration Agreement, we may conduct certain development activities for imetelstat under a Geron IDP if we and Janssen agree that such activities should be performed outside of the mutually agreed global clinical development plan. In the event we conduct any clinical activities under a Geron IDP, we will be responsible for paying all of the development costs for the Geron IDP. Because the outcome of any clinical activities and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate whether any Geron IDP activities we may undertake will succeed. Since we are only eligible for reimbursement from Janssen for their share of the Geron IDP costs plus a premium if any data from a Geron IDP supports approval by a regulatory authority in the United States or other countries, we may not recoup our investment in any Geron IDP, which could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, we may need additional capital to support any Geron IDP activities and we cannot assure you that our existing capital resources, future interest income, potential milestone payments and royalties under the Collaboration Agreement and potential future sales of our common stock will be sufficient to fund these future activities. If sufficient capital is not available, we may be unable to pursue activities under a Geron IDP, which could adversely affect our business. 
         To execute activities under a Geron IDP, we likely would be required to collaborate with contract research organizations, investigators, academic institutions, vendors, clinical trial sites, scientific consultants and others. We would be dependent upon the ability of these parties to perform their responsibilities reliably. In addition, we would have limited control over the activities of these organizations, investigators, scientific consultants and vendors. Except as otherwise required by our agreements with them, we could expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities. If any of these third parties were unable or refused to contribute to projects on which we needed their help, our ability to conduct activities under a Geron IDP could be significantly harmed. Also, if the performance of these services is not of the highest quality, does not achieve necessary regulatory compliance standards, or if such organization or vendor stops or delays its performance for 
 43

   any reason, it would impair and delay our ability to report data from clinical activities under a Geron IDP which would, in turn, hinder our ability to make the necessary representations or provide the necessary information to regulatory authorities, if at all. As a result, we may not obtain regulatory approval and receive any reimbursement from Janssen for their share of the costs for the Geron IDP, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
   If third parties that manufacture imetelstat fail to perform as needed, then the clinical and commercial supply of imetelstat will be limited. 
         Currently, third-party contractors perform certain process development or other technical and scientific work with respect to imetelstat, as well as supply starting materials and manufacture drug substance and drug product. Janssen, which is responsible for the manufacture and management of the supply of imetelstat on a global basis for clinical trials and, after any regulatory approval, all commercial activities, currently relies on these third-party contractors to produce and deliver sufficient quantities of imetelstat and other clinical trial materials to support clinical trials on a timely basis and to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Janssen does not have direct control over these third-party personnel or operations. Reliance on these third-party manufacturers is subject to several risks, including:
 

Â being unable to identify suitable third-party manufacturers, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and regulatory
authorities may require significant activities to validate and qualify any replacement manufacturer, which could involve new testing and compliance inspections; 
Â being unable to contract with third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all; 
Â the inability of third-party manufacturers to timely formulate and manufacture imetelstat or to produce imetelstat in the quantities or of the
quality required to meet clinical and commercial needs; 
Â decisions by third-party manufacturers to exit the contract manufacturing business during the time required to supply clinical trials or to
successfully produce, store and distribute products; 
Â compliance by third-party manufacturers with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, standards mandated by the FDA and state agencies and
other government regulations corresponding to foreign regulatory authorities; 
Â breach or termination of manufacturing contracts; 
Â capacity limitation and scheduling imetelstat as a priority in contracted facilities; and 
Â natural disasters that affect contracted facilities. 

 Each of these risks could lead to delays or shortages in drug supply, or the inability to manufacture drug supply necessary for preclinical and clinical activities, and commercialization. In addition, any decision by Janssen to self-manufacture imetelstat, change third-party contractor manufacturers or make changes to manufacturing processes, product vial size or packaging, or formulations for imetelstat, could result in manufacturing delays. Manufacturing delays could adversely impact the completion of current clinical trials, such as IMbark and IMerge, or the initiation of potential future clinical trials, which may cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement or delay the timing of any Continuation Decision that Janssen could provide to us, either of which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
         In addition, current third-party contractors and/or any other contractors utilized by Janssen may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to 
 44

   implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production of imetelstat. These third-party contractors may not be able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at commercially reasonable costs. Janssen currently does not have any long-term commitments or commercial supply agreements with any of the third-party contractors for imetelstat, and changing manufacturers may be prolonged and difficult due to inherent technical complexities and because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for Janssen to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms, or at all. 
   It may not be possible to manufacture imetelstat at costs or scales necessary to conduct clinical trials or potential future commercialization activities. 
         Oligonucleotides are relatively large molecules produced using complex chemistry, and the cost of manufacturing an oligonucleotide like imetelstat is greater than the cost of making typical small-molecule drugs. Therefore, imetelstat for clinical use is more expensive to manufacture than most other treatments currently available today or that may be available in the future. Similarly, the cost of manufacturing imetelstat for commercial use will need to be significantly lower than current costs in order for imetelstat to become a commercially successful product. Janssen may not be able to achieve sufficient scale increases or cost reductions necessary for successful commercial production of imetelstat. Failure to achieve necessary cost reductions could result in decreased sales and reduced royalties for us, could negatively impact our collaboration with Janssen or could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, any of which would materially and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   We have not yet negotiated our agreement with Janssen specifying all of the terms for our co-promotion of imetelstat should we exercise our U.S. Co-Promotion Option. In addition, we do not have a sales force and may not develop an effective one, if at all. 
         Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, we have a U.S. Co-Promotion Option if we exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights. Assuming we exercise the U.S. Co-Promotion Option, we can elect to provide 20% of the U.S. imetelstat selling effort with Geron sales force personnel, in lieu of funding 20% of U.S. promotion costs upon regulatory approval and commercial launch of imetelstat in the United States. While the Collaboration Agreement includes the material terms of our U.S. Co-Promotion Option, we and Janssen mutually agreed to negotiate a separate agreement specifying detailed activities and responsibilities with respect to the marketing and co-promotion of imetelstat following our election to exercise our U.S. Co-Promotion Option. We will need to negotiate this separate agreement with Janssen and, as a result, Janssen may impose restrictions or additional obligations on us, including financial obligations. Any restrictions or additional obligations may restrict our co-promotion activities or involve more significant financial or other obligations than we currently anticipate. In addition, we have no sales experience as a company, and there are risks involved with establishing our own sales force capabilities, including:
 

Â incurring substantial expenditures to develop a sales force and function; 
Â exposure to unforeseen costs and expenses; and 
Â being unable to effectively recruit, train or retain sales personnel. 

 Accordingly, we may be unable to establish our own sales force, which would delay or preclude us from participating in co-promoting imetelstat in the United States. In addition, because of our current lack of expertise in sales operations, any sales force we establish may not be effective, or may be less effective than any sales force that Janssen utilizes to promote imetelstat. In such event, the commercialization of imetelstat may be adversely affected, since we would be wholly reliant on 
 45

   Janssen's sales efforts, and this could materially and adversely affect any sales milestone or royalties we may receive under the Collaboration Agreement. 
   The Collaboration Agreement limits our ability to transfer our U.S. Co-Promotion Option to a potential acquirer. 
         Although the Collaboration Agreement permits us to be acquired by any company, our right to transfer our U.S. Co-Promotion Option in the case of an acquisition, merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, sale of a majority of assets or similar transaction is limited, and subject to Janssen's sole discretion under certain circumstances. If we are acquired outside of such limited circumstances, then we may not be able to transfer the U.S. Co-Promotion Option to such acquirer as part of the acquisition. This limiting provision may discourage potential acquisition bids for us or lower our value, thus preventing holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of an acquisition, including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from this type of transaction. 
   We may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims. 
         Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products. We may become subject to product liability claims if the use of imetelstat is alleged to have injured patients, including any injuries alleged to arise from any hepatotoxicity or hemorrhagic event associated with the use of imetelstat. We currently have limited clinical trial liability insurance, and we may not be able to maintain this type of insurance for any clinical trials, including clinical trials that we may conduct under a Geron IDP or in collaboration with Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. Being unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
      RISKS RELATED TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
  We remain responsible for prosecuting, at Janssen's direction, the patents we have exclusively licensed to Janssen. The success of our collaboration with Janssen will depend on our ability to protect our technologies and imetelstat through patents and other intellectual property rights. 
         Protection of our proprietary technology is critically important to our business, especially with respect to our collaboration with Janssen. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain, enforce and extend our patents and maintain trade secrets, both in the United States and in other countries. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and our patent rights may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us or Janssen. In the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights, the value of our technologies and imetelstat will be adversely affected, and we or Janssen may not be able or willing to further develop or commercialize imetelstat. Loss or impairment of our intellectual property related to imetelstat might delay or halt ongoing or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat and any applications for regulatory approval, and therefore delay or halt the payment of potential milestone payments to us under the Collaboration Agreement. Further, if imetelstat is approved for commercial sale, such events could impair Janssen's ability to sell imetelstat and therefore result in decreased sales and reduced royalties for us. Occurrence of any of these events could negatively impact our collaboration with Janssen or cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would materially and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations. 
 46

           The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions. In particular, legal principles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents in the United States and in other countries are evolving, and the extent to which we will be able to obtain patent coverage to protect our technologies and imetelstat, or enforce or defend issued patents, is uncertain. 
         A number of significant changes to U.S. patent law occurred when the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, was signed into law on September 16, 2011. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may affect patent litigation. Many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. For example, under the AIA, patent rights are awarded to the first inventor to file a patent application with respect to a particular invention. Since the publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years, the persons or entities that we name as inventors in our patents and patent applications may not have been the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents, or the first to file patent applications for these inventions. As a result, we may not be able to obtain patents for discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be extremely significant to the future success of imetelstat. Thus, our ability to protect our patentable intellectual property depends, in part, on our ability to be the first to file patent applications with respect to our inventions or any joint inventions that we may develop with Janssen. Delay in the filing of a patent application for any purpose, including further development or refinement of an invention, may result in the risk of loss of patent rights. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. 
         Among some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and changes providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the Patent Office. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to invalidate a patent claim in Patent Office proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a Patent Office proceeding sufficient for the Patent Office to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party could attempt to use the Patent Office procedures to invalidate patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Significant impairment of our imetelstat patent rights would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which might cause us to cease operations. 
         U.S. court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, on June 13, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court, or the Court, issued a decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. holding that claims to isolated genomic DNA were not patentable subject matter, but claims to complementary DNA, or cDNA, molecules were patentable subject matter. On March 20, 2012, in  Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court held that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. In addition, court rulings in cases such as  BRCA1- & BRCA2-Based Hereditary Cancer Test Patent Litig. and Promega Corp. v. Life Technologies Corp. have also narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events may have created uncertainty with respect to the value of certain patents we have previously obtained or in-licensed. 
 47

           Depending on decisions by the U.S. federal courts and the Patent Office, the interpretation of laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents. Occurrence of these events could significantly impair our imetelstat patent rights which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which might cause us to cease operations. 
   Challenges to our patent rights would result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that could prevent or limit development of imetelstat. 
         Our patents may be challenged through administrative or judicial proceedings, which could result in the loss of important patent rights. For example, where more than one party seeks U.S. patent protection for the same technology, the Patent Office may declare an interference proceeding in order to ascertain the party to which the patent should be issued. Patent interferences are typically complex, highly contested legal proceedings, subject to appeal. They are usually expensive and prolonged, and can cause significant delay in the issuance of patents. Our pending patent applications, or our issued patents, may be drawn into interference proceedings or be challenged through post-grant review procedures or litigation, any of which could delay or prevent the issuance of patents, or result in the loss of issued patent rights. 
         Under the AIA, interference proceedings between patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013 have been replaced with other types of proceedings, including derivation proceedings. The AIA also includes post-grant review procedures subjecting U.S. patents to post-grant review procedures similar to European oppositions, such as inter partes review, or IPR, covered business method post-grant reviews and other post-grant reviews. U.S. patents owned or licensed by us may therefore be subject to post-grant review procedures, as well as other forms of review and re-examination. In addition, the IPR process under the AIA permits any person, whether they are accused of infringing the patent at issue or not, to challenge the validity of certain patents. As a result, entities associated with hedge funds have challenged valuable pharmaceutical patents through the IPR process. 
         Certain jurisdictions, such as Europe, New Zealand and Australia, permit oppositions to be filed against granted patents or patents proposed to be granted. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen could commercialize imetelstat internationally if approved by regulatory authorities for commercial sale. Therefore, securing both proprietary protection and freedom to operate outside of the United States is important to the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen and our business. Opposition proceedings require significant time and costs, and if we are unable to commit these types of resources to protect our imetelstat patent rights, we and/or Janssen could be prevented or limited in the development and commercialization of imetelstat. 
         As more groups become engaged in scientific research and product development in the areas of telomerase biology, the risk of our patents, or patents that we have in-licensed, being challenged through patent interferences, derivation proceedings, IPRs, post-grant proceedings, oppositions, re-examinations, litigation or other means will likely increase. Challenges to our patents through these procedures would be extremely expensive and time-consuming, even if the outcome was favorable to us. An adverse outcome in a patent dispute could severely harm our collaboration with Janssen or cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, and might cause us to cease operations, by:
 

Â causing us to lose patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction(s); 
Â subjecting us to litigation, or otherwise preventing Janssen or us from commercializing imetelstat in the relevant jurisdiction(s); 
Â requiring Janssen or us to obtain licenses to the disputed patents; 

 48

   

Â forcing Janssen or us to cease using the disputed technology; or 
Â requiring Janssen or us to develop or obtain alternative technologies. 

   We or Janssen may be subject to infringement claims that are costly to defend, and as to which we may be obligated to indemnify Janssen or obtain unblocking licenses, and such claims may limit our or Janssen's ability to use disputed technologies and prevent us or Janssen from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat. 
         The commercial success of imetelstat will depend upon our and Janssen's ability to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell imetelstat without infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and many pharmaceutical companies, including potential competitors, have substantial patent portfolios. In the event our technologies infringe the rights of others or require the use of discoveries and technologies controlled by third parties, we or Janssen may be prevented from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or other proprietary rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies. For example, we are aware that certain third parties have or may be prosecuting patents and patent estates that may relate to imetelstat, and while we believe these patents will expire before imetelstat is commercialized and/or that these patents are invalid and/or would not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of imetelstat, it is possible that the owner(s) of these patents will assert claims against us and/or Janssen in the future. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are obligated under certain circumstances to indemnify Janssen from any claim of infringement of the patent rights of third parties in Janssen's development, manufacture or commercialization of imetelstat, or to obtain unblocking licenses from such third parties, at our cost. 
         Since we cannot be aware of all intellectual property rights potentially relating to imetelstat and its uses, we do not know with certainty that imetelstat, or the intended commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party's intellectual property. Any infringement claims against us or Janssen would likely be expensive to resolve, and the cost of any indemnification of Janssen or unblocking license that we could be required to obtain under the Collaboration Agreement is unpredictable and could be significant. If we or Janssen are unable to resolve an infringement claim successfully, we or Janssen could be subject to an injunction which would prevent us or Janssen from commercializing imetelstat, and could also require us or Janssen to pay substantial damages. In addition to infringement claims, in the future we or Janssen may also be subject to other claims relating to intellectual property, such as claims that we or Janssen have misappropriated the trade secrets of third parties. Provided that Janssen continues to progress the development of imetelstat, we expect to see more efforts by others to obtain patents that are positioned to cover imetelstat. Our success therefore depends significantly on our and Janssen's ability to operate without infringing patents and the proprietary rights of others. 
         We or Janssen may become aware of discoveries and technologies controlled by third parties that are advantageous to developing or manufacturing imetelstat. Under such circumstances, we or Janssen may initiate negotiations for licenses to other technologies as the need or opportunity arises. We or Janssen may not be able to obtain a license to a technology required for the research, development, manufacture or commercialization of imetelstat on commercially favorable terms, or at all, or such licenses may be terminated on certain grounds, including as a result of our or Janssen's failure to comply with the obligations under such licenses. If we or Janssen do not obtain a necessary license or if such a license is terminated, we or Janssen may need to redesign such technologies or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which may not be possible, and even if possible, could cause delays in the development efforts for imetelstat and could increase the development and/or production costs of imetelstat. In cases where we or Janssen are unable to license necessary technologies, we and/or Janssen could be subject to litigation and prevented from researching, developing, manufacturing or 
 49

   commercializing imetelstat, and in certain circumstances we may be required to indemnify Janssen for infringement claims arising from Janssen's research, development, manufacture or commercialization of imetelstat, which could materially and adversely impact our business. Failure by us or Janssen to obtain rights to alternative technologies or a license to any technology that may be required to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize imetelstat would delay potential future clinical trials of imetelstat and any applications for regulatory approval and therefore delay the payment of potential milestone payments to us, or, if imetelstat is approved for commercial sale, could impair Janssen's ability to sell imetelstat and therefore result in decreased sales and reduced royalties for us. Occurrence of any of these events could negatively impact our collaboration with Janssen or cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would materially and adversely affect our business, and might cause us to cease operations. 
   We may become involved in disputes with Janssen or any past or future collaborator(s) over intellectual property inventorship or ownership, and publications by us or Janssen, or by investigators, scientific consultants, research collaborators or others could impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which, in either case, could have a significant impact on our business. 
         Inventions discovered under research, material transfer or other such collaborative agreements, including our Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, may become jointly owned by us and the other party to such agreements in some cases and the exclusive property of either party in other cases. Under some circumstances, it may be difficult to determine who invents and owns a particular invention, or whether it is jointly owned, and disputes can arise regarding inventorship and ownership of those inventions. These disputes could be costly and time-consuming and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse effect on our business if we were not able to protect or license rights to these inventions. In addition, clinical trial investigators, scientific consultants and research collaborators generally have contractual rights to publish data and other proprietary information, subject to review by us and/or Janssen. Publications by us or Janssen, or by investigators, scientific consultants, previous employees, research collaborators or others, either with permission or in contravention of the terms of their agreements or otherwise, may impair the ability to obtain patent protection or protect proprietary information which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which might cause us to cease operations. 
   Much of the information and know-how that is critical to our business is not patentable, and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information and establishing competitive enterprises. 
         We sometimes rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology, especially in circumstances in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or available. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and contractors. We cannot provide assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, any of which would harm our business significantly. 
         In May 2016, the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, or the DTSA, was enacted, providing a federal cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets. Under the DTSA, an employer may not collect enhanced damages or attorney fees from an employee or contractor in a trade secret dispute brought under the DTSA, unless certain advanced provisions are observed. We cannot provide assurance that our existing agreements with employees and contractors contain notice provisions that would enable us to seek enhanced damages or attorneys' fees in the event of any dispute for misappropriation of trade secrets brought under the DTSA.

  Significant disruptions of information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business. 
         Our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our computer systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses that may result in the impairment of key business processes. Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         In addition, our data security and information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breachesÂwhether by employees or othersÂthat may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public disclosure of sensitive clinical or commercial data, and the exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, collaborators, clinical trial patients and others. A data security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could result in increased costs or loss of revenue as a result of:
 

Â harm to our reputation; 
Â additional compliance obligations under federal and/or state breach notification laws; 
Â requirements for mandatory corrective action to be taken by us; and 
Â requirements to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect
personal data. 

 If we are unable to prevent such data security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive patient data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. 
      RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING 
  Although we reported a small profit for the year ending December 31, 2015, we have a history of losses and anticipate continued future losses, and our continued losses could impair our ability to sustain operations. 
         Until 2015, we had never been profitable and we had incurred operating losses every year since our operations began in 1990. While we were profitable in 2015 due to the recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, we expect to incur additional operating losses and, as clinical development activities for imetelstat continue under our Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, our operating losses may increase in size. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was approximately $957.9 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. 
         Substantially all of our revenues to date have been payments under collaborative agreements and milestones, royalties and other revenues from our licensing arrangements. Any revenues generated from our licensing arrangements or ongoing collaborative agreements, including the Collaboration 
 51

   Agreement with Janssen, may not be sufficient alone to sustain our operations. For example, we expect revenues under our license agreements related to our telomerase technology to decline significantly in the coming years, and to be eliminated by the end of 2019, due to upcoming patent expirations on such technology. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will receive any milestone payments or royalties from Janssen in the future. We may be unsuccessful in entering into any new corporate collaboration, partnership or license agreements that result in revenues, or existing collaborative agreements or license arrangements, such as the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, may be terminated or expire. 
         We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures. This will result in decreases in our working capital, total assets and stockholders' equity, which may not be offset by milestone payments or royalties from Janssen or by future financings. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve consistent future profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen through milestone payments or royalties, and we may never achieve consistent future profitability. Even if we do become profitable in the future, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to achieve consistent future profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and our ability to sustain operations. 
   We may require additional capital to support development and commercialization of imetelstat in collaboration with Janssen and to otherwise grow our business, and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain. 
         We may need additional capital resources in order to support development and commercialization of imetelstat, especially if we elect to exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights and U.S. Co-Promotion Option under the Collaboration Agreement and potentially independently pursue imetelstat development under our own IDP, and to otherwise support the future growth of our business through the potential acquisition and/or in-licensing of other oncology products, product candidates, programs or companies. We cannot assure you that our existing capital resources, future interest income, potential milestone payments and royalties under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen and potential future sales of our common stock, including pursuant to our At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or 2015 Sales Agreement, with MLV & Co. LLC, or MLV, will be sufficient to fund future planned activities. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
 

Â the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs; 
Â in the event that Janssen provides an affirmative Continuation Decision to us, whether we then elect our U.S. Opt-In Rights to share further
U.S. development and promotion costs for imetelstat beyond IMbark or IMerge under the Collaboration Agreement, including our share of development costs incurred to date by Janssen that we will be
required to reimburse if we exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights; 
Â to the extent permitted under the Collaboration Agreement, whether we independently pursue imetelstat development under our own IDP; 
Â our potential reimbursement obligations to Janssen if any data from a Janssen IDP support approval by regulatory authorities in the United
States or other countries; 
Â the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones resulting in the payment to us from Janssen under the Collaboration
Agreement and the timing of receipt of such payments, if any; 
Â changes or delays in Janssen's development plans for imetelstat, including changes which may result from interim data reviews or any future
clinical holds on any INDs for imetelstat; 
Â Janssen's ability to meaningfully reduce manufacturing costs of imetelstat; 

 52

   

Â the progress, timing, magnitude, scope and costs of clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of imetelstat, including the
number of indications being pursued, subject to clearances and approvals by the FDA and other regulatory authorities; 
Â the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals in the United States and in other countries; 
Â Janssen's ability to successfully market and sell imetelstat, upon regulatory approval or clearance, in the United States and other countries; 
Â if we exercise our U.S. Opt-In Rights, our decision to also exercise our U.S. Co-Promotion Option, including the costs and timing of building a
U.S. sales force; 
Â the sales price and availability of adequate third-party reimbursement for imetelstat; 
Â the timing, receipt and amount of royalties under the Collaboration Agreement on worldwide net sales of imetelstat, upon regulatory approval or
clearance, if any; 
Â the cost of acquiring and/or in-licensing other oncology products, product candidates, programs or companies, if any; 
Â the timing, receipt and amount of any milestone payments or royalties on sales of any products licensed under the License Agreement by Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, upon regulatory approval or clearance, if any; 
Â expenses associated with the pending class action securities lawsuits, as well as any other litigation; and 
Â the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims. 

         In addition, changes in our business may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner than we expect. If our existing capital resources, future interest income, and potential milestone payments and royalties under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen are insufficient to meet future capital requirements, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. 
         Further, if the Collaboration Agreement is terminated, including as a result of Janssen's failure to provide an affirmative Continuation Decision to us, or for any other reason, we would not receive any milestone payments or royalties under the Collaboration Agreement, and then, depending on the timing of such event, we would be required to fund all clinical development, manufacturing and commercial activities for imetelstat should we elect to continue the development of imetelstat ourselves, which would require us to raise additional capital or establish alternative collaborations with third-party collaboration partners, which may not be possible. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated and we are unable to raise additional capital or establish alternative collaborations with third-party collaboration partners for imetelstat, the development of imetelstat would be discontinued, which might cause us to cease operations. Additional financing through public or private equity financings, including pursuant to our 2015 Sales Agreement with MLV, capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may raise equity capital at a stock price or on other terms that could result in substantial dilution of ownership for our stockholders. The receptivity of the public and private equity markets to proposed financings is substantially affected by the general economic, market and political climate and by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control. In this regard, continued volatility and instability in the global financial markets and political climate could adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds through financings and the terms upon which we may raise those funds. 
 53

           Our ability to raise additional funds will be severely impaired in the event of:
 

Â changes or delays in Janssen's development plans for imetelstat, including as a result of any future clinical holds on any IND for imetelstat
or interim data reviews; 
Â a failure to show adequate safety or efficacy of imetelstat in current or potential future clinical trials, which may result in a decision by
Janssen to delay or discontinue further development of imetelstat; or 
Â a termination of the Collaboration Agreement or if our collaboration with Janssen is otherwise unsuccessful. 

         If sufficient capital is not available, we may be unable to fulfill our funding obligations under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, resulting in our breach of the Collaboration Agreement, which could lead to Janssen paying lower milestone payments and lower royalties to us under a reduced royalty tier. This would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
         Moreover, in order to grow and diversify our business, we plan to continue our business development efforts to identify and seek to acquire and/or in-license other oncology products, product candidates, programs or companies. Acquisition or in-licensing opportunities that we may pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. In addition, there can be no assurance that sufficient additional capital would be available to us in order to pursue any of these opportunities. 
   Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 
         Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change," generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, may have resulted or could in the future result in an ownership change. If a limitation were to apply, utilization of a portion of our domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods. In addition, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities which could adversely impact our financial position. 
      RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  Historically, our stock price has been extremely volatile. 
         Historically, our stock price has been extremely volatile. Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2016, our stock has traded as high as $9.85 per share and as low as $0.91 per share. Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016, the price has ranged between a high of $5.92 per share and a low of $1.39 per share. The significant market price fluctuations of our common stock have been due to and may in the future be influenced by a variety of factors, including:


Â not receiving timely regulatory clearances or approvals in any jurisdiction, whether within or outside of the United States, including, if we,
Janssen or future investigators do not obtain regulatory clearance to commence, conduct or continue clinical trials of imetelstat in MF, MDS or any additional hematologic myeloid malignancies in a
timely manner or at all, or to amend any clinical trial protocol with respect to the conduct of a current clinical trial; 
Â developments in our collaboration with Janssen, including the termination, modification or amendment of the Collaboration Agreement, or
disputes regarding the collaboration; 

 54

   

Â announcements regarding the research and development of imetelstat, including results of, delays in, discontinuation of, or modifications to
any clinical trials of imetelstat, and investor perceptions thereof; 
Â announcements regarding the safety of imetelstat, including announcements similar to our March 2014 announcements that the FDA had placed a
full clinical hold on our IND for imetelstat and a partial clinical hold on the investigator's IND for the Pilot Study due to safety concerns; 
Â announcements regarding plans to discontinue any imetelstat clinical trials, including IMbark or IMerge; 
Â announcements regarding regulatory developments concerning imetelstat; 
Â the experimental nature of imetelstat; 
Â perception by our stockholders about the adequacy of potential payments we may receive under the Collaboration Agreement; 
Â the demand in the market for our common stock; 
Â announcements of technological innovations, new commercial products, or clinical progress or lack thereof by us, our collaborators, licensees,
partners or our competitors; 
Â fluctuations in our operating results; 
Â our declining cash balance as a result of operating losses; 
Â general market conditions or market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries; 
Â announcements concerning imetelstat proprietary rights; 
Â comments by securities analysts; 
Â large stockholders exiting their position in our common stock; 
Â announcements of or developments concerning pending and/or potential future litigation; 
Â the issuance of common stock to partners, vendors or investors to raise additional capital or to acquire other oncology products, product
candidates, programs or companies; and 
Â the occurrence of any other risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading "Risk Factors." 

         Stock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons, including factors which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations, such as media coverage, statements made on message boards and social media forums, legislative and regulatory measures and the activities of various interest groups or organizations. In addition to the risk factors described in this section, overall market volatility, as well as general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment. 
   If we fail to continue to meet the listing standards of NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock. 
         Our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on NASDAQ. In particular, NASDAQ rules require us to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock. If the closing bid price of our common stock were to fall below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days or we do not meet other listing requirements, we would fail to be in compliance with NASDAQ's listing standards. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet 
 55

   the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC may initiate the delisting process with a notification letter. If we were to receive such a notification, we would be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of our common stock would need to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable NASDAQ listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders' equity or market values of our common stock, in which case our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease. 
   The sale of a substantial number of shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
         The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could significantly and negatively affect the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016, we had 300,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance and 159,158,636 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, we had reserved 30,148,830 shares of our common stock for future issuance pursuant to our option and equity incentive plans and outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2016. Issuing additional shares could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment. 
         Future sales of our common stock, including pursuant to our 2015 Sales Agreement with MLV, or the issuance of common stock to satisfy our current or future cash payment obligations or to acquire technology, property, or other businesses, could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, under the universal shelf registration statement filed by us in August 2015 and declared effective by the SEC in September 2015, we may sell any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings, up to a cumulative value of $250 million. The sale or issuance of our securities, as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans and outstanding warrants, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment. 
   Our undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids; this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting rights of holders of our common stock. 
         Our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to 3,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imported upon these shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. 
         In addition, if in the future, we issue preferred stock that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 
 56

     Provisions in our charter, bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us, which may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they believe may be the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers. 
         Provisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management, including provisions that:
 

Â prevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent; 
Â divide the board of directors into separate classes with terms of office that are structured to prevent all of the directors from being elected
in any one year; and 
Â set forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders' meetings. 

         Provisions of Delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations. In addition, we have severance agreements with several employees and a company-wide severance plan, either of which could require a potential acquirer to pay a higher price. Either collectively or individually, these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers, including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions. 
   We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 
         We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. 
   Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. 
         Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Our annual reports on Form 10-K must contain an annual assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must provide an opinion annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
         The requirements of Section 404 are ongoing and also apply to future years. We expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops. Although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Therefore, we cannot be certain that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered in the future. If material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies occur, such weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 57



     RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS 
  Competitors may develop technologies that are superior to or more cost-effective than ours, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat, which could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement and damage our ability to sustain operations. 
         The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, the study of telomeres, telomerase, or our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry, and the research and development of therapies for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies. In addition, other products and therapies that could directly compete with imetelstat currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. 
         Many companies are developing alternative therapies to treat hematologic myeloid malignancies. For example, if approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against Incyte Corporation's ruxolitinib, or JakafiÂ®, which is orally administered. In clinical trials, JakafiÂ® reduced spleen size, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, bone pain, night sweats and itching in MF patients. Recently, there have also been reports of overall survival benefit as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis from JakafiÂ® treatment. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co-existing cytopenias, or low blood cell counts; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF-associated anemia include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide. There are other investigational treatments for MF further along in development than imetelstat, such as pacritinib by CTI Biopharma Corporation, or CTI Biopharma, and momelotinib by Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, which have reported results from Phase 3 clinical trials, and other inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway, such as NS-018 by NS Pharma, Inc., as well as several investigational treatments in early phase testing such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, interleukin-3 receptor targeted agents, inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, hypomethylating agents, PI3 Kinase and mTOR inhibitors, anti-fibrosis antibodies, hedgehog and SMO inhibitors, PIM kinase inhibitors, IAP inhibitors, anti-LOX2 inhibitors, recombinant pentraxin 2 protein, KIP-1 activators, TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, FLT inhibitors, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
         If approved for commercial sale for the treatment of lower risk MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of treatment options, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents and other hematopoietic growth factors; immunomodulators, such as lenalidomide by Celgene Corporation, or Celgene; hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine by Celgene and decitabine by Janssen; in addition to investigational treatments that may be further along in development than imetelstat, such as oral versions of azacitidine; histone deacetylase inhibitors; TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, such as luspatercept by Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; PI3 Kinase inhibitors; aminopeptidase inhibitor, such as tosedostat by CTI Biopharma; TLR2-specific antibodies; anti-CD33 antibodies; Fas ligand inhibitors; and JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors. 
         Independently, Janssen is developing therapies for hematologic malignancies, including AML, MDS, multiple myeloma and ABC-subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Molecular and cellular pathways of interest include:
 

Â cell surface targets for immune-directed therapy; 
Â immune checkpoint inhibition; 
Â leukemia stem cells; 

 58

   

Â pathway addiction (genetic alterations, cell-type specific pathways); 
Â conditional sensitivity (stress, protein-producing tumors); 
Â targeting of T-cells and natural killer "NK" cells to tumors; 
Â identification of novel tumor-specific antigens; and 
Â progression from early MDS to AML and cancer interception. 

 Success by Janssen in any of these approaches may compete with imetelstat or render imetelstat obsolete or noncompetitive, which could lead to a decision by Janssen to discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would materially and adversely affect our business and business prospects and might cause us to cease operations. 
         Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program. 
         In addition to the above factors, imetelstat will face competition based on:
 

Â product efficacy and safety; 
Â convenience of product administration; 
Â cost of manufacturing; 
Â the timing and scope of regulatory consents; 
Â status of reimbursement coverage; 
Â price; and 
Â patent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others. 

         As a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than us or Janssen. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their products below what Janssen may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third-party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost-effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.

     To be successful, imetelstat must be accepted by the health care community, which can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products. 
         If approved for marketing, imetelstat may not achieve market acceptance since hospitals, physicians, patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize imetelstat. If approved for commercial sale, imetelstat will compete with a number of conventional and widely accepted drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies. The degree of market acceptance of imetelstat will depend on a number of factors, including:
 

Â the clinical indications for which imetelstat is approved; 
Â the establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of imetelstat; 
Â the ability to demonstrate that imetelstat is superior to alternatives on the market at the time; 
Â the ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantage of imetelstat over alternative treatment methods, including with
respect to cost and route of administration; 
Â the label and promotional claims allowed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for imetelstat, if any; 
Â the timing of market introduction of imetelstat as well as competitive products; 
Â the effectiveness of sales, marketing and distribution support for imetelstat; 
Â the availability of adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing by government and third-party payors; and 
Â the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage by third-party payors, including governmental authorities. 

         The established use of conventional products competitive with imetelstat may limit or preclude the potential for imetelstat to receive market acceptance upon any commercialization. Janssen may be unable to demonstrate any pharmacoeconomic advantage for imetelstat compared to established or standard-of-care therapies, or newly developed therapies, for hematologic myeloid malignancies. Third-party payors may decide that any potential improvement that imetelstat may provide to clinical outcomes in hematologic myeloid malignancies is not adequate to justify the costs of treatment with imetelstat. If third-party payors do not view imetelstat as offering a better balance between clinical benefit and treatment cost compared to standard-of-care therapies or other treatment modalities currently in development, imetelstat may not be commercially viable. If the health care community does not accept imetelstat for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, our ability to earn potential milestone payments and royalties under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen would be negatively impacted and our business and business prospects would be severely and adversely affected. 
   If we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, transparency, and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. 
         Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we 
 60

   research, market, sell and distribute any product of ours for which marketing approval is obtained. Such laws include:
 

Â the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering,
receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or
recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
Â the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act and its qui
tam or whistleblower provisions, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be
presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
Â the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other
things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
Â HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which
imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually
identifiable health information; 
Â the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which
payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS,
information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to
CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members; and 
Â analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing
arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply
with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report
information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the
privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

         Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could 
 61

   adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. 
   If acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for imetelstat is not obtained, the use of imetelstat could be severely limited. 
         The ability to successfully commercialize imetelstat will depend significantly on obtaining acceptable prices and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to the patient from third-party payors. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Assuming Janssen obtains coverage for imetelstat by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. If approved for commercial sale, patients are unlikely to use imetelstat unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of imetelstat. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. 
         Government authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require Janssen to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of imetelstat to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
         We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, Janssen may not successfully commercialize imetelstat, even if marketing approval is obtained. 
         There may also be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. 
         In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, became law and substantially changed the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions that may have a significant impact on our business. 
         While the Court upheld the constitutionality of most elements of the ACA in June 2012 and upheld the ACA against challenges to nationwide tax subsidies in July 2015, other judicial and Congressional challenges against the ACA are likely to be brought in the future. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with 
 62

   authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. We cannot assure that the ACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, or any legislation that may replace the ACA, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. 
         In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law in January 2013, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
         In the future, we anticipate additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices, or the amounts of reimbursement available for imetelstat. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business and financial results. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on the potential royalties under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen on worldwide net sales of imetelstat, if approved. 
         Cost control initiatives also could decrease the price that Janssen may receive for imetelstat in the future. If imetelstat is not considered cost-effective or adequate third-party reimbursement for the users of imetelstat cannot be obtained, then Janssen may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on the investment in imetelstat, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to earn potential milestone payments and royalties under the Collaboration Agreement, or could cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement. Any of these events would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.
