Item 1. Business
Overview
Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a loyal community of over 5.9 million Members as of June 30, 2021. We pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient, while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the best versions of themselves. We define a Member as any individual who has a Peloton account through a paid Connected Fitness Subscription, or a paid Peloton Digital subscription.
We are an innovation company at the nexus of fitness, technology, and media. We have disrupted the fitness industry by developing a first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines the best equipment, proprietary networked software, and world-class streaming digital fitness and wellness content, creating a product that our Members love. 
Driven by our Members-first mindset, we built a vertically integrated platform that ensures a best-in-class, end-to-end experience. We have a direct-to-consumer multi-channel sales platform. We had 123 showrooms as of June 30, 2021, with knowledgeable sales specialists, a high-touch delivery service, and helpful Member support teams. 
Our world-class instructors teach classes across a variety of fitness and wellness disciplines, including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor running and walking, Bike and Tread bootcamps, yoga, Pilates, Barre, strength training, stretching, meditation, and floor cardio. We produce hundreds of original programs per month and maintain a vast and constantly updated library of thousands of original fitness and wellness programs. We make it easy for Members to find a class that fits their interests based on class type, instructor, music genre, length, available equipment, area of physical focus, and level of difficulty.
Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected Fitness Products and associated recurring Subscription revenue. We have historically experienced significant growth in sales of our Connected Fitness Products, which, when combined with our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn led to significant growth in Connected Fitness Subscriptions. Our Connected Fitness Subscription base grew by 114% in fiscal 2021.
Our compelling financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong retention, recurring revenue, and efficient subscription acquisition. When we acquire new Connected Fitness Subscriptions, we are often able to offset our subscription acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our Connected Fitness Products. This allows for rapid payback of our sales and marketing investments and results in a robust unit economic model.
We are a fast-growing and scaled fitness platform. For fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019:
•We generated total revenue of $4,021.8 million, $1,825.9 million, and $915.0 million, respectively, representing 120% and 100% year-over-year growth;
•We recognized net losses of $(189.0) million, $(71.6) million, and $(195.6) million, respectively; and
•Our Adjusted EBITDA was $253.7 million, $117.7 million, and $(71.3) million, respectively.
See Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.
For fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, key operational metrics of our business included:
•Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2,330,700; 1,091,100; and 511,200 respectively; and
•Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.61%; 0.62%; and 0.65%, respectively.
For a definition of Connected Fitness Subscriptions and Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operational and Business Metrics.”
Our Products
Connected Fitness Products
Bike
Our current Bike features a carbon steel frame, a nearly silent belt drive, durable magnetic resistance, and a 22” high-definition touchscreen with built-in stereo speakers to stream live and on-demand classes, all in a compact, 4’ by 2’ footprint. Our Bike is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. 
Bike+ 
Our new Bike+ provides an immersive cardio experience and seamless transition to floor-based exercises with its 24”, 360 degree rotating display. Members can easily pivot and tilt the screen to add strength, yoga, and stretching to their routine or take our all new 
Bike Bootcamp class series. Resistance on Bike+ is controlled digitally allowing Members to “Auto Follow” their instructors’ class programs and control resistance from the touchscreen. A powerful built-in soundbar and subwoofer system offers an improved audio experience while the integrated Apple GymKit simplifies Apple Watch pairing. Bike+ is currently available for purchase in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia.
Tread
The newest addition to our Tread line has all the essential elements of the Tread+ experience but in a more affordable and compact form factor – maintaining ample running surface area and runner comfort. The Tread features a sleek belt drive, 24” touchscreen with integrated soundbar and subwoofer, and ergonomic pace and incline control knobs and jump buttons. With an immersive audio and video experience and heart rate monitor integration, Peloton Tread is designed for both on-Tread as well as floor-based bootcamp content. Tread is currently available for purchase in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and will be available for purchase in Germany in Fall 2021.
Tread+
Tread+ features a shock-absorbing rubber-slat belt and ball bearing system, ideal for low-impact training. Pace and incline ergonomic control knobs allow for seamless adjustments, and the 32” high-definition touchscreen features a 20-watt sound bar. Tread+ had only been available for sale in the United States, however, on May 5, 2021, we decided to issue a voluntary product recall on Tread+, which we are conducting in collaboration with the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"). At this time, we are not able to forecast a date for sales to resume in the United States. See Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Laws, Regulation, and Legal Proceedings." 
Subscriptions
Connected Fitness Subscriptions
Our Connected Fitness Subscriptions are on a month-to-month basis, allow for multiple household users, and provide unlimited access to all live and on-demand classes. Our Connected Fitness Subscription allows Members to access classes through our Connected Fitness Products, compete on our motivating leaderboard, track performance metrics, and connect and interact with the broader Peloton community. Our Connected Fitness Subscription also includes access to our content through Peloton Digital, our digital app, which is available through iOS and Android mobile devices and most tablets and computers. On average, we had 2.2 Members per Connected Fitness Subscription as of June 30, 2021.
Peloton Digital
Peloton Digital began as a companion app for Connected Fitness Subscriptions to provide access to our classes while our Members were away from their Connected Fitness Products. A Peloton Digital Subscriber is an individual who has a paid Peloton Digital subscription with a successful credit card billing. 
Peloton Digital is included with all Connected Fitness Subscriptions. As of June 30, 2021, 69% of our Members on Connected Fitness Subscriptions used Peloton Digital to supplement their workout regimen. Peloton Digital also helps us attract new Connected Fitness Subscriptions by serving as an acquisition tool for new Members.
Peloton Digital workouts include indoor/outdoor running and walking, Bike and Tread bootcamps, yoga, Pilates, Barre, strength training, stretching, meditation, and floor cardio. Our Members have shown strong interest in these new verticals; in fiscal 2021, 42% of workouts completed were across non-cycling fitness verticals. 
Our Vertically Integrated Fitness Platform
Technology
Our content delivery and interactive software platform are critical to our Member experience. We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platform, develop new products and features, and improve the speed, scalability, and security of our platform infrastructure. Our research and development organization consists of world-class engineering, product, and design teams. Our engineering, product, and design teams work together to bring our products to life, from conception and validation to implementation. We constantly improve our existing Connected Fitness Products through frequent software updates, rapid iteration of feature enhancements, and new innovations. 
Our video streaming pipeline utilizes cloud providers for stream generation, storage, and distribution. The integration with these providers is customized and developed by our engineering team and is designed to integrate with our product and systems. This enables a high-quality Member experience and high availability of services across diverse consumer platforms and geographies.
Content and Music
We create engaging, original fitness and wellness content in an authentic live environment that is immersive and motivating while encouraging a sense of community. We combine high production value content with a broad catalog of music to create a truly unique fitness experience our Members love.
Content Development
We use performance data to understand our Members’ workout habits in order to evolve and optimize our programming around class type, length, music, and other considerations. We have developed a diverse content library with thousands of classes across an extensive range of class lengths, difficulty levels, and fitness preferences ranging from fun and flexible to structured and highly technical, all of which our Members easily access through filtering and search capabilities. As of June 30, 2021, we produce original programs from our production studios in New York City and London, with 40 instructors, and across 11 fitness and wellness disciplines including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor running and walking, Bike and Tread bootcamps, yoga, strength training, stretching, meditation, and floor cardio. 
As we further expand internationally, we will develop localized content, as we have done in the United Kingdom and Germany where we produce content featuring five British and three German instructors from our London studio. Most recently, we onboarded our first Australian instructor, coinciding with the launch of our Australian operations. As we expand into other non-English-speaking countries, we will produce classes in local languages from our existing studios and use subtitling for our English-speaking programming. We currently produce our content in three languages: English, German, and Spanish.
Instructors
In front of the camera, our instructors play a critical role in bringing the Peloton experience to life for our Members. Our instructors are not only authorities in their respective areas of fitness, but also relatable, magnetic personalities who inspire passionate followings. We offer a diverse cast of instructors that allows us to appeal to a broad audience of Members. Our instructors inspire our Members off-camera by attending showroom openings and other Member-focused events, like Homecoming, where they meet and interact with our Members. Our Members feel connected to our instructors and many Members travel long distances to take a live class at our Peloton studios.
Production Team
Behind the camera, our studio production teams are dedicated to creative excellence. We have top production talent representing decades of experience at major broadcast and cable networks, some of whom have won Emmy Awards for production excellence. Our teams provide dedicated creative support to our instructors before, during, and after live productions with the help of content performance data. All classes are shot in broadcast quality environments with a fraction of the staff and budget typical of a major network show. This allows us to deliver a constant stream of live-produced, authentic fitness and wellness programming with cinematic quality that provides clarity of instruction and entertainment value.
Music and Music Technology
We have developed a proprietary music platform that fuels the workout experience with thoughtfully curated playlists that align with our Members’ musical preferences. As of June 30, 2021, we had over 2.6 million songs under license, representing one of the largest audiovisual connected fitness music catalogs in the world. Our curated music is as diverse and dynamic as the Members we serve, delivering a custom-fit-and-finish musical experience created by instructors and music supervisors on our production team.
We control the intersection of fitness and music in a deeply engaging way, motivating Members to achieve their fitness goals while discovering great music in the process. Peloton is a discovery resource for new artists and songs while also providing the opportunity for our Members to re-discover music they love. Members consistently rank the music we feature as one of their favorite aspects of the Peloton experience. We believe we have taken a leading position in the fitness and wellness category by defining new standards for musical content partnerships which include the development of our signature Artist Series to spotlight the legacy and catalog of some of the biggest names in the industry, premiering new music exclusives available only on Peloton, and working with artists to co-curate classes based on their own music or influences.
We have applied, and will continue to apply, technological solutions and an artist-centric partnership strategy to enhance our music platform including:
•data-driven playlist recommendations for our instructors and music supervisors to use in developing class plans;
•instructor-facing song search and filtering functions, including the ability to search by song length and beats per minute;
•real-time music and content management and reporting;
•for Members, a display of every song played in a class, including artist name and associated artwork;
•ability for Members to “like” songs they discover anywhere on our platform and save it to their profile;
•integrations with Spotify and Apple Music, enabling Members to sync songs they hear on Peloton to their streaming service; and
•strengthening and leveraging artist partnerships on and off-platform for deeper membership engagement and heightened brand profile.
Music Rights Strategy
We have built a world class music rights content management and reporting system to meet the needs of our music rights holders in order to support our highly-engaged, growing global community. Peloton is increasingly seen by our partners as an impactful music discovery platform, which has created opportunities to progressively and meaningfully enhance our classes with custom music experiences. We expect this to continue as we invest in music-first technology to improve the quality of our Members’ experience, strengthen our competitive advantage over other fitness platforms, and add value to our Members.
Sales and Marketing
Our goal is to increase brand awareness and purchase intent for our Connected Fitness Products and Subscriptions. We use a unique combination of brand and product-specific performance marketing to build brand awareness and generate predictable sales of our Connected Fitness Products. 
Video has been the strongest medium to communicate the features of the Peloton platform. We primarily market through advertisements on broadcast and cable television, social media, and over-the-top providers such as Hulu and YouTube to reach our target audience, focusing on incremental return on investment.
Direct to Consumer, Multi-Channel Sales Model
We sell our products directly to customers through a multi-channel sales platform that includes e-commerce, inside sales, showrooms, and in a small number of cases, a "store within store" concept. Our sales associates use robust customer relationship management tools to deliver an elevated, personalized, and educational purchase experience, regardless of channel of capture and conversion.
•E-Commerce and Inside Sales: Our desktop and mobile websites, www.onepeloton.com, www.onepeloton.co.uk, www.onepeloton.de, www.onepeloton.ca, and www.onepeloton.com.au provide an elevated brand experience where visitors can learn about our products and services and access product reviews. Our inside sales team engages with customers by phone, email, and online chat on our websites, and offers one-on-one sales consultations seven days a week.
•Showrooms: Our showrooms allow customers to experience and try our products. We provide interactive product demonstrations and many of our showrooms have private areas where customers can do a “test ride” or “test run.” We frequently host Peloton community events in our showrooms, which help deepen brand engagement and loyalty. 
•Commercial: The commercial and hospitality markets represent a small percentage of sales but are important to driving trial and brand awareness. Our Bikes in hospitality locations help keep our Members riding when they travel, creating further Member engagement, loyalty, and convenience. Across our markets as of June 30, 2021, there were approximately 14,000 Peloton Bikes in over 7,000 commercial locations.
•Corporate Wellness: Our Corporate Wellness program provides employers, insurers, and other partners with the opportunity to offer their employees and Members subsidized access to Peloton Digital subscriptions, All Access Memberships, and/or Connected Fitness products and delivers on our oft-stated goal to make Peloton even more accessible.
Showroom Site Strategy
As of June 30, 2021, we operated 123 retail locations across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Our retail locations are located primarily in upscale malls, lifestyle centers, and premium street locations. When evaluating potential new markets, we carefully examine historical sales data, key demographics, traffic patterns, geographic locations, and co-tenancy of other complementary lifestyle-oriented retailers. In the United States, we attempt to cluster stores around major urban markets and suburbs while also operating in super regional and regional centers that draw from a greater trade area. In Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, we will continue to focus on major urban markets.
We operate three retail formats including our large showrooms which range from 1,500 to 3,000 square feet and “microstores” which are typically around 300 square feet. Large showrooms comprise 73% of our retail locations and provide space for Connected Fitness Products and Peloton-branded apparel, as well as private areas for “test rides” and “test runs.” Microstores represent 15% of our retail locations and are typically placed in highly visible “center court” areas. Concession stores represent 12% of our retail locations and consist of a presence within a partner's retail space in the U.K. and Germany. Our large showroom leases are typically five to ten years in lease duration while microstores are typically open for up to 1.5 years. Microstores allow us to test markets and specific shopping areas, and provide a temporary location while searching for the ideal large showroom space.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to close our global showrooms in accordance with local state and municipal guidelines. Though all of our stores have reopened, we will continue to adhere strictly to applicable government protocols regarding open-status, capacity limits and masking requirements. Should we face pandemic-related showroom closures in the future, our e-commerce and inside sales channels would allow us to remain open to continue to sell our Connected Fitness Products. 
Membership & Member Support Services
The Membership team is focused on driving engagement to help us maintain our high Connected Fitness Subscription retention rates. The team develops new ways to promote engagement with our products and community or help Members reengage with our platform when activity has lapsed. The Membership team helps curate goal-based challenges, awards digital badges for Member accomplishments, and sends Peloton-branded “Century Club” shirts after a Member’s 100th class. The team also communicates with Members with no recent activity through email campaigns that help encourage these Members to get back to their workout routine. The Membership team also collects and responds to feedback about our platform that is on our primary Facebook group of over 425,000 Members as of June 30, 2021.
In order to bring our community together, we organize several in-person events throughout the year including welcoming Members for workouts, milestone celebrations, and instructor meet-and-greets at our production studios in New York City and London. We also host Members at our showrooms, and celebrate our Members with our flagship Member event, Peloton Homecoming, held in New York City 
and remotely each May. All in-person events were cancelled due to the pandemic and will resume when safe to do so in accordance with our global safety standards and in compliance with all applicable municipal ordinances. 
The Member Support team was created to serve all the needs of our customers and Members including sales support, scheduling, delivery, installation, account and billing inquiries, product trouble-shooting and repair, product education, returns and exchanges, and anything else our Members need. This team primarily operates in Plano, Texas with additional presence in New York, New York, Tempe, Arizona, and London, England. We also utilize third-party support services in Europe and North America to help us efficiently scale our team.
Manufacturing and Logistics
We manufacture and assemble as well as outsource the manufacturing of our Peloton products to multiple contract manufacturers in Asia. We have recently started to execute our plans to expand our manufacturing and assembly capabilities in North America with facilities in Washington and North Carolina through the acquisition of Precor and our recently announced plans to build a manufacturing facility in Ohio called Peloton Output Park. The components used in our products are sourced either directly by us or on our behalf by our contract manufacturers from a variety of component suppliers. To continue to provide our Members with leading fitness technology, our supply chain team coordinates the relationships between our contract manufacturers and component suppliers. We regularly review our existing contract manufacturers and component suppliers, and evaluate new partners and suppliers, to ensure that we can scale our manufacturing base as we grow.
We purchase from our primary contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis. Under our governing agreements, our contract manufacturers must follow our established product design specifications, quality assurance programs, and manufacturing standards. We have developed relationships with our partners to maintain access to the resources needed to scale seasonally and ensure our partners have the requisite experience to produce our Connected Fitness Products and accessories. We pay for and own certain tooling and equipment specifically required to manufacture our products to have control of supply and component pipelines. 
In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and manufacturers when possible, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions, such as maintaining inventory of single source components or utilizing alternative freight lanes that can have cost implications. However, given the current global supply and freight constraints driven by the pandemic, as well as natural disasters, we face challenges with various manufacturing related component shortages.
Logistics and Fulfillment
To control every touchpoint of our product and service offering, we have built networks of last mile field operations centers, which have further expanded from the United States into Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia. With locations in major markets of North America and Europe as of June 30, 2021, our field operations team supports in-home delivery of our Connected Fitness Products with professional high-touch set up service and ongoing in-home service and care. As highly trained experts on our products and services, our field specialists offer product education, assistance with account set up, and tips and recommendations for product care and content selection. As we grow our logistics network, we are able to efficiently service, deploy, and install replacement parts to our Members over time.
With our commitment to our Members-first approach, we will continue to invest to strengthen our field operations’ coverage in locations we identify as cost-effective delivery markets throughout North America and in new international regions. To further scale our distribution system and maintain flexibility, we also work with third-party fulfillment partners that deliver our products from multiple locations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. Third-party fulfillment partnerships allow us to reduce order fulfillment time, reduce shipping costs, and expand our geographical reach. 
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.
As of June 30, 2021, we held 116 U.S. issued patents and had 83 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 101 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions and 139 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. issued patents expire between November 20, 2021 and January 29, 2039. As of June 30, 2021, we held 42 registered trademarks in the United States, including the Peloton mark and our “P” logo and also held 362 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Competition
We believe that our first-mover advantage, leading market position, brand recognition, and vertically integrated platform set us apart in the rapidly growing market for connected, technology-enabled fitness. We provide a superior value proposition and benefit from the clear endorsement of our Connected Fitness Subscriptions, giving us a competitive advantage versus traditional fitness and wellness products and services, and future potential entrants.
While we believe we are changing the consumption patterns for fitness and growing the market, our main sources of competition include in-studio fitness classes, fitness clubs, at-home fitness equipment and content, and health and wellness apps.
The areas in which we compete include:
•Consumers and Engagement. We compete for consumers to join our platform through Connected Fitness Subscriptions or Peloton Digital subscriptions, and we seek to engage and retain them through an integrated experience that combines content, software, service, and community.
•Product Offering. We compete with producers of fitness products and work to ensure that our Connected Fitness Products maintain the most innovative technology and user-friendly features.
•Talent. We compete for talent in every vertical across our company including technology, media, fitness, design, supply chain, logistics, music, marketing, finance, strategy, legal, and retail. As our platform is highly dependent on technology, hardware, and software, we require a significant base of engineers to continue innovating.
The principal competitive factors that companies in our industry need to consider include, but are not limited to: total cost, supply chain efficiency across sourcing and procurement, manufacturing, and logistics, enhanced products and services, original content, product quality and safety, competitive pricing policies, vision for the market and product innovation, strength of sales and marketing strategies, technological advances, and brand awareness and reputation. We believe we compete favorably across all of these factors and we have developed a business model that is difficult to replicate.
Government Regulation
We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and throughout the world, including those related to privacy, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor, product quality and safety, accessibility, competition, customs and international trade, and taxation. These laws often require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information, such as personal data, “special categories of personal data” or health data. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year compared to other quarters, due in large part to seasonal holiday demand, New Year’s resolutions, and cold weather. For example, in fiscal 2018 and 2019, our second and third quarters combined each represented 63% of our total revenue. We also typically incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods. In fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and the recalls of our Tread products in the fourth quarter impacted our traditional seasonal patterns, with the second and third fiscal quarters accounting for 58% of fiscal 2021 sales (excluding Precor sales which were consolidated beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter only of 2021). As the pandemic receded in recent months, we experienced a return to pre-pandemic seasonal trends. However, the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen or its effects could be prolonged, including due to the impact of variants, which may affect seasonal trends. 
Human Capital 
Our Culture 
Our dynamic culture expresses our expansive vision and passion for community and collaboration, and is shaped by the following fundamental values:
•Put Members First: We obsess over every touchpoint of our Member experience. We have a Member-centered mindset that prioritizes a positive product and brand experience. We are proud to be pioneers and innovators of a global, product-oriented, fitness-centered community.
•Operate With a Bias for Action: We value innovation, continuous improvement, and challenging the status quo, all of which are keys to success in a competitive environment.

•Empower Teams of Smart Creatives: We hire individuals who are great at what they do, and encourage all of our team members to think openly and creatively to solve tough, exciting problems. We empower our team members to think and act like owners.
•Together We Go Far: As our company name suggests, we know the value of a well-functioning team. We believe that inclusivity is essential to success, and are proud when diverse individuals work together to advance our business and generate positive impact for our Members, our workforce, and the communities where we operate. 
We live these values through our approach to human capital management, summarized below. 
Employees
As of June 30, 2021, we employed 6,743 individuals in the United States across our New York City headquarters, Plano campus, Atlanta office, showrooms, and field operations warehouses. Internationally, we had 828 employees in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia across corporate, showroom, and warehouse functions, 135 employees in Canada largely in showroom and warehouse roles, and 160 individuals in Taiwan across manufacturing, quality engineering and operations functions. In April 2021, we completed our acquisition of Precor and added Precor's 796 employees located across 14 countries to our team, with most based primarily in manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Washington state. We also hire additional seasonal employees in our field operations, Member support, and showrooms during the holiday season. 
Certain of our instructors are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA. However, we are not signatories to any agreements with SAG-AFTRA. With the exception of SAG-AFTRA, none of our domestic employees are currently represented by a labor organization or a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
One of our core tenets is to become an anti-racist organization, and in 2020, we committed ourselves to the Peloton Pledge, our $100 million dollar investment to combat systemic racism. Through the Peloton Pledge we are investing across three areas: 
•$60 million to substantially increase wages for our hourly employees;
•$20 million for learning and development programs to support upward mobility for our hourly employees; and
•$20 million to support third party organizations empowering individuals experiencing systemic inequalities through physical fitness and mental wellness.
For our employees, the Pledge has meant an increased emphasis on delivery of value-added, team-wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs, including the appointment of a Senior Vice President and Global Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. In addition, we are participating in the Management Leadership for Tomorrow Black Equity at Work Certification, and offer our employees an online resource, the Antiracism Activation Center, to bolster their journey toward becoming an antiracist ally. 
We have also introduced specific learning programs for managers, such as Prototyping Inclusion and Activating Allyship, to help our leaders support our diversity, inclusion, and belonging goals. We similarly host a “Brave Conversations'' speaker series on race and equity that provides regular opportunities to gather and learn from world-renowned leaders about what it means to be antiracist. 
When it comes to supporting our employees, we are proud to have eight active and engaged Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. These groups foster belonging and engagement by bringing team members together to create support, development opportunities, and programming for all of our team members. Our ERGs include: 
•ACE@Peloton (Asian)
•Black@Peloton
•LHIT@Peloton (Latino/Hispanic)
•Peloton Pride + Allies
•The Parenthood Journey
•The Women’s Alliance
•Veterans@Peloton
•Thrive (mental health, neurodiversity, and disability needs)
To hold ourselves accountable on pay equity, we conduct an annual third-party audit of team members’ pay to confirm that our pay-for-performance philosophy transcends race and gender. If an audit reveals any pay differences between team members who hold similar jobs, but are of different races or genders, we work to analyze and adjust the affected team members’ compensation as applicable. 
Employee Safety
We work to prioritize the health and welfare of our Team, our Members, and our environment. The core elements of our employee health and safety strategy are risk analysis, incident management, documented processes, environmental programs, training, and occupational health. Our Global Safety & Security Operations team looks to optimize safe operations, also providing employees with access to our Risk Operations Center and our Whistleblower Hotline to report risks to health and safety. We continually strive to improve processes across field safety training, incident training, professional investigations, and standardization of physical security resources, among other areas.
With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we sought to ensure that the top priority continued to be the safety and security of our Team and Members by training all field and corporate teams on COVID-19 safety and by requiring utilization of masks, personal protection equipment, social distancing, and additional safety measures as appropriate.
Training, Development, and Engagement
At Peloton, we have a dedicated global learning and development team that develops and delivers company-wide learning and development experiences across all functions. These include: 
•Connected Leadership for managers, which focuses on Peloton’s approach to leadership, coaching and team member connectivity
•TEMPO internal hiring and mobility program, which supports professional growth 
•Specialized training programs for field operations, inside sales, retail, and Member support teams
•Peloton Academy, which houses training resources for all teams roles across the company
•Weekly skills workshops with additional learning opportunities for all employees
We are committed to making Peloton the best place to work by engaging with, and listening to, our employees. We maintain ongoing connection with our team members through our company intranet, Pelonet; monthly all-hands meetings, and multiple team member engagement surveys during the year. Recent surveys have led to enhancements across safety and security, employee connection, and learning and professional development initiatives. 
Our Patent Incentive Program provides rewards to and recognition to qualifying team members whose inventions are included in a patent application submitted by Peloton, and the Peloton High Five Fund, a team member and Peloton-funded grant, enables team members to provide financial relief to help other team members who are facing hardship resulting from a natural disaster or unforeseen personal challenge. 
Competitive Compensation and Work/Life Harmony
Our compensation program is structured around our overarching philosophy of rewarding demonstrable performance and aligning employees with our goals and strategy.
