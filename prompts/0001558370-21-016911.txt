Item 1. Business
General
Prudential Bancorp is a Pennsylvania corporation that was incorporated in June 2013. It is the successor corporation to Prudential Bancorp, Inc. of Pennsylvania (“Old Prudential Bancorp”), the former stock holding company for Prudential Bank (the “Bank” and formally known as “Prudential Savings Bank”), a Pennsylvania-chartered, FDIC-insured savings bank, after the completion in October 2013 of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Prudential Mutual Holding Company (the “MHC”), the former mutual holding company for the Bank.
The mutual-to-stock conversion was completed on October 9, 2013. In connection with the conversion, Prudential Bancorp sold 7,141,602 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share in a public offering. In addition, 2,403,207 shares were issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of common stock of Old Prudential Bancorp held by shareholders other than the MHC. Each share of Old Prudential Bancorp’s common stock owned by the public was exchanged for 0.9442 shares of Prudential Bancorp common stock. Gross proceeds from the conversion and offering were approximately $71.4 million. Upon completion of the offering and the exchange, 9,544,809 shares of common stock of Prudential Bancorp were issued and outstanding.
As of January 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Polonia Bancorp, Inc. (“Polonia Bancorp”) and Polonia Bank, Polonia’s wholly owned subsidiary. Polonia Bancorp and Polonia Bank were merged with and into the Company and the Bank, respectively. As a result of Polonia shareholder stock and cash elections and the related proration provisions of the merger agreement, Prudential Bancorp issued approximately 1,274,197 shares of its common stock and approximately $18.9 million in the merger.
Prudential Bancorp’s business activity primarily consists of the ownership of the Bank’s common stock. Prudential Bancorp does not own or lease any property. Instead, it uses the premises, equipment and other property of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related financial data, relates primarily to the Bank. As a bank holding company, Prudential Bancorp is subject to the regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”).
The Company’s results of operations are primarily dependent on the results of the Bank. As of September 30, 2021, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of approximately $1.1 billion, total deposits of approximately $711.5 million, and total stockholders’ equity of approximately $130.5 million.
The Bank is a community-oriented savings bank headquartered in South Philadelphia which was originally organized in 1886 as a Pennsylvania-chartered building and loan association known as “The South Philadelphia Building and Loan Association No. 2.” The Bank grew through a number of mergers with other institutions with the last merger being with Polonia Bank completed in January 2017. The Bank converted to a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank in August 2004. The banking office network currently consists of the headquarters and main office and nine additional full-service branch offices. Seven of the banking offices are located in Philadelphia (Philadelphia County), one is in Drexel Hill, Delaware County and one is in Huntingdon Valley, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The Bank maintains ATMs at all of the banking offices. The Bank also provides on-line and mobile banking services.
We are primarily engaged in attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to invest in loans and securities. The Company’s principal sources of funds are deposits, repayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities and calls of investment securities and interest-bearing deposits, funds provided from operations and funds borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank (”FHLB”) of Pittsburgh. These funds are primarily used for the origination of various loan types including single-family residential mortgage loans, construction and land development loans, non-residential or commercial real estate mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial business loans and consumer loans. Traditionally, the Bank focused on originating long-term, single-family residential mortgage loans for portfolio. However, in recent years the focus has shifted to emphasizing commercial real estate and construction and land development lending. Construction and land development loans increased from $145.5 million or 22.3% of the 

4



total loan portfolio at September 30, 2017 to $205.4 million or 29.0% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. The Company also increased its commercial real estate loans from $127.6 million or 19.6% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2017 to $166.0 million or 23.5% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021 and our commercial business loans increased from $488,000 or 0.1% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2017 to $57.2 million or 8.1% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. See “-Lending Activities” and “-Asset Quality”
The investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolio decreased by $117.2 million to $326.0 million at September 30, 2021 from $443.2 million at September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to sales and paydowns of investment and mortgage-backed securities. The Company recorded approximately $1.6 million in gains on sale of investment and mortgage-backed securities during fiscal 2021. At September 30, 2021, the investment and mortgage-backed securities available for sale had an aggregate net unrealized gain of $7.7 million compared with an aggregate net unrealized gain of $13.4 million as of September 30, 2020.

At September 30, 2021, the Company’s non-performing assets totaled $12.5 million or 1.1% of total assets as compared to $13.0 million or 1.2% of total assets at September 30, 2020. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2021 included three construction loans aggregating $4.1 million, 18 one-to-four family residential mortgage loans aggregating $3.0 million, two commercial real estate loans aggregating $1.3 million and two construction loans aggregating $4.1 million that were foreclosed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and are held as other real estate owned. At September 30, 2021, the Company had two loans totaling $1.1 million that were classified as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). One TDR is on non-accrual and consists of a $391,000 loan secured by a single-family residential property which is performing in accordance with the restructured terms. The remaining TDR is a $705,000 commercial real estate loan classified as non-accrual and is part of a lending relationship totaling $6.0 million (after taking into account the previously disclosed $1.9 million write-down recognized during the quarter ending March 31, 2017 related to this borrowing relationship as well as the two construction loans noted above that became other real estate owned during the quarter ended June 30, 2021). The primary project of the borrower (the development of a 169-unit townhouse project in Bristol Borough, Pennsylvania) is the subject of litigation between the Bank and the borrower. As previously disclosed, subsequent to the commencement of the litigation, the borrower filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 (Reorganization) of the federal bankruptcy code in June 2017. The Bank moved the underlying litigation with the borrower noted above from state court to the federal bankruptcy court in which the bankruptcy proceeding is being heard. The state litigation is stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. As of September 30, 2021, 35 units have been sold in the project resulting in $875,000 applied against the outstanding debt owed the Bank.  As of September 30, 2021, the Company had reviewed $8.4 million of loans for possible impairment of which $8.4 million was classified substandard compared to $13.0 million reviewed for possible impairment and $13.0 million of which was classified substandard as of September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, the allowance for loan losses totaled $8.5 million, or 1.4% of total loans and 101.6% of total non-performing loans (which included loans acquired from Polonia Bank at their fair value) at September 30, 2021. See “-Asset Quality”.

Market Area and Competition
Most of Prudential Bancorp’s business activities are conducted within a few hours’ drive from Philadelphia and include eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and southern New York.
We face substantial competition from other financial institutions in our service area, especially from many local community banks, as well as many local credit unions. Competition among financial institutions is based upon a number 

5



of factors, including the quality of services rendered, interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other credit services, service charges, the convenience of banking facilities, locations and hours of operation and, in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers, applicable lending limits. Many of the financial institutions with which we compete have greater financial resources than we do, and offer a wider range of deposit and lending products.
We believe that an attractive niche exists serving small to medium-sized business customers not adequately served by our larger competitors, and we will seek opportunities to build commercial relationships to complement our retail strategy. We believe small to medium-sized businesses will continue to respond in a positive manner to the attentive and highly personalized service we provide.
Lending Activities
General. At September 30, 2021, the net loan portfolio totaled $618.2 million or 56.2% of total assets. The Company has changed its lending philosophy and increased its investment in loans for construction and land development, commercial real estate and commercial business loans which comprised in the aggregate 60.6% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. Management believes it has the expertise to underwrite these types of loans which management believes will enhance the Company’s earnings while reducing interest rate risk due to the generally shorter contractual maturity of such loans. At September 30, 2021, the Company still held $202.3 million of residential real estate loans collateralized by one-to-four family, also known as “single-family”, residential properties located primarily in the Company’s market area.
The types of loans that we may originate are subject to federal and state banking laws and regulations. Interest rates charged by us on loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans and the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by general and economic conditions, the monetary policy of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters.
Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated.

----+------------------------------------------------

The Bank originates construction and development loans and commercial real estate loans with fixed rates and shorter contractual maturities (than is generally the case for residential mortgage loans). To a lesser extent, single-family residential mortgage loans are originated for sale on the secondary market in order to mitigate interest rate risk and to increase non-interest income.
Loan Originations. The Bank’s lending activities are subject to underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. Loan originations are obtained through a variety of sources, including existing customers as well as new customers obtained from referrals and local advertising and promotional efforts. Consumer loan applications are taken at any of our offices while loan applications for all other types of loans, including home equity and home equity lines of credit, are taken only at our main office. All loan applications are processed and underwritten centrally at our executive office in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania.
Single-family residential mortgage loans are generally written on standardized documents used by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC” or “Freddie Mac”) and Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA” or “Fannie Mae”). Property valuations of loans secured by real estate are undertaken by independent third-party appraisers approved by the board of directors and are reviewed internally before acceptance. At both September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company had no residential real estate loans in portfolio that would be considered subprime loans, which we define as mortgage loans advanced to borrowers who do not qualify for loans bearing market interest rates 

7



because of problems with their credit history.  The Bank does not originate and has not in the past originated subprime loans.
We also purchase participation interests in larger balance loans, typically commercial real estate and construction and land development loans, from other financial institutions in our market area. Such participations are reviewed for compliance, are underwritten independently in accordance with our underwriting criteria and are approved before they are purchased by the Management Loan Committee and one of the following: the President’s Committee, the Executive Committee or the full Board, depending upon the dollar amount of the participation interest being purchased. Generally, loan purchases have been without any recourse to the seller, but on occasion we have obtained such provisions. However, we actively monitor the performance of such loans through the receipt of regular updates, including inspection reports, from the lead lender regarding the loan’s performance, discussing the loan with the lead lender on a regular basis and receiving copies of updated financial statements of the borrower from the lead lender. These loans are subjected to regular internal reviews in accordance with our loan policy.
The Bank typically holds a 100% interest in construction and land development loans. The Bank has in the past and currently reserves the option to sell participation interests. We generally have sold participation interests in loans only when a loan would exceed the Bank’s internal and/or legal loans to one borrower limits. With respect to the sale of participation interests in loans, we have typically received commitments to purchase the participation interests offered prior to the time the loan is closed. See “-Lending Activities - Construction and Land Development Lending.”
As part of the Bank’s loan policy, we are permitted, to make loans to one borrower and related entities in an aggregate amount of up to 15% of the capital accounts of the Bank which consist of the aggregate of its capital, surplus, undivided profits, capital securities and allowance for loan losses. At September 30, 2021, the Bank’s internal “guidance” limit is $15.0 million to one borrower or borrowing relationship as a threshold. The Bank is permitted to exceed such limit in certain situations subject to the (i) approval of the Board of Directors and (ii) subject to the overall legal/regulatory lending limit which was calculated to be $19.9 million at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2021, our three largest loans to one borrower and related entities amounted to $16.0 million, $16.0 million and $14.9 million. The largest relationship is with a real estate developer located in northern New Jersey and consists of a multi-family residential housing construction project, two commercial real estate loans and a personal line of credit. The second largest relationship consists of a participation interest in a $16.0 million commercial line of credit secured by commercial real estate in central and northern New Jersey. The third largest relationship consists of a participation interest in a construction loan to construct a 30 story, 102 unit mixed-use luxury apartment building in Manhattan, New York. The three relationships are all performing in accordance with contractual terms. For more information regarding these loans, see “-Lending Activities - Construction and Land Development Lending.”
The following table shows our total loans originated, purchased, sold and repaid during the periods indicated.

One-to-Four Family Residential Mortgage Lending. One of the Bank’s primary lending activities continues to be the origination or purchase of loans secured by first mortgages on one-to-four family residential properties located in the Company’s market area. Our single-family residential mortgage loans are obtained through the lending department and branch personnel. The balance of such loans has decreased from $351.3 million or 53.8% of total loans at September 30, 2017 to $202.3 million, or 28.6% of total loans at September 30, 2021. The percentage of total loans as well as the total amount that such loans have represented of the loan portfolio has decreased as our focus has shifted to the origination of commercial real estate loans, construction and land development loans and commercial business loans.
Single-family residential mortgage loans generally are underwritten on terms and documentation conforming to guidelines issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. We currently offer adjustable-rate mortgage and balloon loans, which are structured as shorter term fixed-rate loans (generally 10 years or less) followed by a final payment of the full amount of the principal due at the maturity date. Due to the interest rate environment, originations of such loans have been limited in recent years. At September 30, 2021, $32.9 million, or 16.3%, of our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio consisted of adjustable-rate loans, including hybrid loans. We also originate fixed-rate, fully amortizing mortgage loans with maturities of 15, 20 or 30 years, for resale in the secondary market on a servicing release basis.
While continuing to operate in the historically low current interest rate environment and to assist in the implementation of our asset/liability management policy, we have placed an emphasis on the origination of single-family mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary markets.
We underwrite one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95%, provided that the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance on loans that exceed 80% of the appraised value or sales price, whichever is less, of the secured property. We also require that title insurance, hazard insurance and, if appropriate, flood insurance be maintained on all properties securing real estate loans. A licensed appraiser appraises all properties securing one-to-four family first mortgage loans. Our mortgage loans generally include due-on-sale clauses which provide us with the contractual right to deem the loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of the property.
Our single-family residential mortgage loans also include home equity loans and lines of credit, which amounted to $2.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively, at September 30, 2021. The unused portion of home equity lines was $6.6 million at such date. Our home equity loans are fully amortizing and have terms to maturity of up to 20 years. While home equity loans also are secured by the borrower’s residence, we generally obtain a second mortgage position on these loans. Our lending policy requires that our home equity loans have loan-to-value ratios, when combined with any first mortgage, of a maximum 80% or less at time of origination, although the preponderance of our home equity loans have combined loan-to-value ratios of 75% or less at time of origination. We also offer home equity revolving lines of credit with interest tied to the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a stipulated margin. Generally, we have a second mortgage on the borrower’s residence as collateral on our home equity lines. In addition, our home equity lines generally have loan-to-value ratios (combined with any loan secured by a first mortgage) of 75% or less at time of origination. Our customers may apply for home equity lines as well as home equity loans at any banking office. 
Construction and Land Development Lending. We have maintained our emphasis on construction and land development loan originations because construction loans have shorter terms to maturity, provide an attractive yield and generally have either higher fixed interest rates or adjustable interest rates. At September 30, 2021, our construction and loan development loans amounted to $205.4 million, or 29.0% of our total loan portfolio. This amount includes $80.6 million of undisbursed loans in process. The average size of our construction and land development loans, excluding loans to our largest lending relationship, was approximately $2.2 million at September 30, 2021. Our construction loan portfolio has increased substantially since September 30, 2017 when construction loans amounted to $145.5 million or 22.3% of our total loan portfolio.

Other than our loan participations, loans to finance the construction of condominium projects or single-family homes and subdivisions are generally offered to experienced builders in our primary market area with whom we have an established relationship. Residential construction and development loans are offered with terms of up to 36 months although typically the terms are 12 to 24 months. The maximum loan-to-value limit applicable to these loans is 75% of the appraised post construction value and the policy does not require amortization of the principal during the term of the loan. We often establish interest reserves and obtain personal and corporate guarantees as additional security on the construction loans. Interest reserves are used to pay the monthly interest payments during the development phase of the loan and are treated as an addition to the loan balance. Interest reserves pose an additional risk to the Company if it does not become aware of deterioration in the borrower’s financial condition before the interest reserve is fully utilized. In order to help monitor the risk, financial statements and tax returns are obtained from borrowers on an annual basis. Additionally, construction loans are reviewed at least annually pursuant to a third-party loan review. Construction loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspection by approved appraisers or loan inspector warrants. Construction loans are negotiated on an individual basis but typically have floating rates of interest based upon the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a stipulated margin. Additional fees may be charged as funds are disbursed. In addition to interest payments during the term of the construction loan, we typically require that payments to reduce the principal outstanding be made as units are completed and released. Generally, such principal payments must be equal to 110% of the amount attributable to the acquisition and development of the lot plus 100% of the amount attributable to construction of the individual home. We typically permit a pre-determined limited number of model homes to be constructed on an unsold or “speculative” basis. All other units must be pre-sold before we will disburse funds for construction. Construction loans also include loans to acquire land and loans to develop the basic infrastructure, such as roads and sewers. The majority of the construction loans are secured by properties located in our primary lending area.
Set forth below is a brief description of the five largest construction loans or loan relationships.
The largest construction loan is in the amount of $10.0 million of which $9.8 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. This loan was originated in March 2017 and is a participation interest in a $26.1 million loan purchased from another financial institution. The proceeds were used to construct 66 residential units and 9,000 square feet of retail space in Jersey City, New Jersey. The project was approximately 100.0% complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
The second largest construction loan is in the amount of $9.5 million of which $9.5 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. This loan was originated in February 2019 and is a participation interest in a $33.0 million loan purchased from another financial institution. The proceeds were used to construct 201 apartments in East Orange, New Jersey. The project was approximately 100.0% complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
The third largest construction loan is in the amount of $9.1 million of which $9.0 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. This loan was originated in November 2018. The proceeds were used to construct 208 apartments in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The project was approximately 100.0% complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
The fourth largest construction loan is also in the amount of $10.0 million of which $9.0 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. The loan was originated in March 2017 and is a participation interest in a $18.8 million loan purchased from another financial institution. The proceeds were used to construct 89 apartment units and seven retail space in Newark, New Jersey. The project was approximately 100.0% complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
The fifth largest construction loan is in the amount of $8.3 million of which $8.3 million had been disbursed as of September 30, 2021. This loan was originated in June 2018 The proceeds were used to construct a 41 unit residential apartment complex in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The project was approximately 93.0% complete as of September 30, 2021. The loan is performing in accordance with its contractual terms.
Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the 

10



initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated costs, including interest, of construction and other assumptions. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio. Additionally, if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project, when completed, having a value less than the loan amount. Furthermore, because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor.
​
Multi-Family Residential and Commercial Real Estate Loans. At September 30, 2021, multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans amounted in the aggregate to $242.1 million or 34.2% of the total loan portfolio.
The commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate loan portfolio consists primarily of loans secured by small office buildings, strip shopping centers, small apartment buildings and other properties used for commercial and multi-family residential purposes located in the Company’s market area. At September 30, 2021, the average commercial and multi-family real estate loan size was approximately $1.2 million. At September 30, 2021, the largest relationship consists of a participation interest in a $14.9 million variable rate loan secured by a 102 unit mixed-use luxury apartment building in Manhattan, New York. The second largest multi-family residential or commercial real estate loan at September 30, 2021 was a $11.5 million fixed-rate loan secured by a 316 unit apartment complex located in East Rutherford, New Jersey with retail space on the first floor. Substantially all of the properties securing the multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans are located in the Company’s primary lending area.
Although terms for commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans vary, our underwriting standards generally allow for terms up to 15 years with loan-to-value ratios of not more than 75%. Most of the loans are structured with balloon payments of 10 years or less and amortization periods of up to 25 years. Interest rates are either fixed or adjustable, based upon designated market indices such as the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a stipulated margin or, with respect to our multi-family residential loans, the Average Contract Interest Rate for previously occupied houses as reported by the Federal Housing Finance Board. In addition, fees are charged to the borrower at the origination of the loan.
Commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate lending involves different risks than single-family residential lending. These risks include larger loans to individual borrowers and loan payments that are dependent upon the successful operation of the project or the borrower’s business. These risks can be affected by supply and demand conditions in the project’s market area for rental housing units, office and retail space and other commercial space. We attempt to minimize these risks by limiting loans to proven businesses, only considering properties with existing operating performance which can be analyzed, using conservative debt coverage ratios in our underwriting, and periodically monitoring the operation of the business or project and the physical condition of the property.
Various aspects of commercial and multi-family loan transactions are evaluated in an effort to mitigate the additional risk in these types of loans. In our underwriting procedures, consideration is given to the stability of the property’s cash flow history, future operating projections, current and projected occupancy levels, location and physical condition. Generally, we impose a debt service ratio (the ratio of net cash flows from operations before the payment of debt service to debt service) of not less than 120%. We also evaluate the credit and financial condition of the borrower, and if applicable, the guarantor. With respect to loan participation interests we purchase, we underwrite the loans as if we were the originating lender. Appraisal reports prepared by independent appraisers are reviewed by us prior to the closing of the loan.
In recent years, the Company has shifted its emphasis to originate for portfolio more multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans, due to their higher yields and shorter duration. 
Commercial Business Loans. At September 30, 2021, commercial business loans amounted to $57.2 million, or 8.1% of our loan portfolio. 
Commercial business loans are made to small to mid-sized businesses in our market area primarily to provide working capital. Small business loans may have adjustable or fixed rates of interest and generally have terms of three years 

11



or less but may be as long as 15 years. Our commercial business loans have historically been underwritten based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and generally require a debt service coverage ratio of at least 120%. In addition, we generally obtain personal guarantees from the principals of the borrower with respect to commercial business loans and frequently obtain real estate as additional collateral.
Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with single-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial real estate lending.  Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral-based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values, and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default.  Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, and/or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things.  Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment.
Consumer Lending Activities. We offer various types of consumer loans such as loans secured by deposit accounts and unsecured personal loans. Consumer loans are originated primarily through existing and walk-in customers and direct advertising. At September 30, 2021, $530,000, or 0.1% of the total loan portfolio consisted of consumer loans.
Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter terms than residential loans. However, consumer loans have additional credit risk due to the type of collateral securing the loan or in some cases the absence of collateral.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our Board of Directors establishes the Bank’s lending policies and procedures. Our various lending policies are reviewed at least annually by our management team and the Board in order to consider modifications as a result of market conditions, regulatory changes and other factors.
The Company maintains separate loan approval committees with tiered levels of approval authority. The Management Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), the Chief Lending Officer (“CLO”), the Chief Credit Officer (“CCO”), the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), the Compliance Risk Officer (“CRO”) and the Controller has lending approval authority of up to $3.0 million. The next tier in the approval process, with an approval range of $3.0 million to $10.0 million, is the President’s Loan committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the COO. All loans in excess of $10.0 million must be presented to the full Board of Directors for approval. All loans submitted to the top two tiers of approval must be recommended for approval by the Management Loan Committee. Single-family residential loans originated for sale into the secondary market are processed through underwriting software and are reviewed for approval by two senior officers in the credit department.
Asset Quality
General. One of our key objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. In addition to maintaining credit standards for new originations which we believe are prudent, we are proactive in our loan monitoring, collection and workout processes in dealing with delinquent or problem loans. We have also retained an independent, third party to undertake reviews of the credit quality of a random sample of new loans as well as all of our major loans on at least an annual basis.
Reports listing all delinquent accounts are generated and reviewed by management on a monthly basis. These reports include information regarding all loans 30 days or more delinquent as to principal and/or interest and all real estate owned properties and are provided to the Board of Directors. The procedures we take with respect to delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan, period and cause of delinquency and whether the borrower is habitually delinquent. When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. We generally send the borrower a written notice of non-payment after the loan is first past due. Our guidelines provide that telephone, written correspondence and/or face-to-face contact will be attempted to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects of repayment. When contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to foreclosure, we will attempt to obtain full payment, work out a repayment schedule with the borrower 

12



to avoid foreclosure or, in some instances, accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In the event payment is not then received or the loan is not otherwise satisfied, additional letters and telephone calls generally are made. If the loan is still not brought current or satisfied and it becomes necessary for us to take legal action, which typically occurs after a loan is 90 days or more delinquent, we will commence foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before foreclosure sale, the property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure and, if purchased by us, becomes real estate owned. Since there has not been a significant increase in recent years in the one-to-four family residential loans that are 90 days past due, the Company was not adversely impacted by any recent government programs related to the foreclosure process.
On loans where the collection of principal or interest payments is doubtful, the accrual of interest income ceases (“non-accrual” loans). On loans 90 days or more past due as to principal and/or interest payments, our policy is to discontinue accruing additional interest and reverse any interest previously accrued. On occasion, this action may be taken earlier if the financial condition of the borrower raises significant concern with regard to his/her ability to service the debt in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Interest income is not accrued on these loans until the borrower’s financial condition and payment record demonstrate an ability to service the debt.
Property acquired by the Bank through foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of cost, which is the carrying value of the loan, or fair value at the date of acquisition, which is fair value of the related assets at the date of foreclosure, less estimated costs to sell. Thereafter, if there is a further deterioration in value, we charge earnings for the diminution in value. The Bank’s policy is to obtain an appraisal on real estate subject to foreclosure proceedings prior to the time of foreclosure if the property is located outside the Company’s market area or consists of other than single-family residential property. We obtain re-appraisals on a periodic basis, generally on at least an annual basis, on foreclosed properties. We also conduct inspections on foreclosed properties.
We account for our impaired loans in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An impaired loan generally is one for which it is more likely than not, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all the amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan. Large groups of smaller balance, homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Loans collectively evaluated for impairment include smaller balance commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans and consumer loans. These loans are evaluated as a group because they have similar characteristics and performance experience. Larger commercial real estate, construction and land development and commercial business loans are individually evaluated for impairment on at least a quarterly basis by management. All loans classified as substandard as part of the loan review process or due to delinquency status are evaluated for potential impairment. There were $8.4 million of loans evaluated for impairment as of September 30, 2021 (of which $6.0 million is related to one relationship), consisting of $4.1 million of construction and land development loans, $3.0 million of one-to-four family residential loans and $1.3 million of commercial real estate loans, all of which were classified as substandard. Although no specific allocations were applied to these loans, there were charge-offs totaling $40,000 incured during fiscal 2021. As of September 30, 2021, there were eighteen loans totaling $8.1 million designated as special mention loans consisting of four non-residential real estate loans aggregating $6.7 million and thirteen single-family residential loans aggregating $1.4 million. As of September 30, 2020, there were twenty-one loans totaling $11.4 million designated as special mention loans, consisting of eight non-residential real estate loans aggregating $10.0 million and thirteen single-family residential loans aggregating $1.4 million.
Federal regulations and our policies require that we utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets. We have incorporated an internal asset classification system, consistent with Federal banking regulations, as a part of our credit monitoring system. We currently classify problem and potential problem assets as “special mention”, “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to 

13



sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated “special mention.”
When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as “substandard” or “doubtful,” it is required that a general valuation allowance for loan losses be established for loan losses in accordance with established methodology. General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allocations, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as “loss,” it is required to charge off such amount.
Our allowance for loan losses includes a portion which is allocated by type of loan, based primarily upon our periodic reviews of the risk elements within the various categories of loans. The specific components relate to certain impaired loans. The general components cover non-classified loans and are based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors in response to changes in risk and market conditions. Our management believes that, based on information currently available, the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which covers all known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at each reporting date. However, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of the allowance for loan losses may become necessary.
We review and classify assets on no less frequently than a quarterly basis and the Board of Directors is provided with reports on our classified and criticized assets. We classify assets in accordance with the management guidelines described above. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had no assets classified as “doubtful” or “loss” and $8.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively, of assets classified as “substandard.” In addition, there were $8.1 million and $11.4 million of loans designated as “special mention” as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In response to the current situation surrounding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has provided and continues to provide assistance to its customers in a variety of ways. The Company participated in the Paycheck Protection Program offered under the CARES Act as a Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender. During the fiscal year 2020, we had originated 63 requests for Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans totaling approximately $5.1 million. These loans were sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 at a net gain of $111,000. During fiscal 2021, we acted as a broker for a third party for our borrowers to utilize the the second PPP loan program. We are working closely with our loan customers to effectively manage our portfolio through the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the duration, impact and government response to the crisis. 
​
The CARES Act provided guidance around the modification of loans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which outlined, among other criteria, that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as defined under the CARES Act prior to any relief, are not TDRs. This includes short-term modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers are considered current under the CARES Act and related regulatory guidance if they are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company made COVID-19 pandemic related modifications on 160 loans aggregating to $149.7 million. All of these borrowers had resumed making payments as of September 30, 2020. Loan modifications in accordance with the CARES Act and related regulatory guidance are still subject to an evaluation in regard to determining whether or not a loan is deemed to be impaired.

Non-Performing Loans and Real Estate Owned. The following table sets forth information regarding non-performing loans and real estate owned. The Company’s general policy is to cease accruing interest on loans which are 90 days or more past due and to reverse all accrued interest. At September 30, 2021, all of the loans listed as 90 or more days past due in the table above were in non-accrual status. At September 30, 2021, the Company had two loans aggregating $1.1 million that were classified as TDRs. As of September 30, 2021, one of such loans in the amount of $705,000 was classified as non-performing and is related to one $6.0 million non-performing lending relationship. The remaining TDR is also on non-accrual and consists of a $391,000 loan secured by a single-family property.
The following table shows the amounts of non-performing assets (defined as non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest and real estate owned) at the dates indicated. There were no loans more than 90 days delinquent as to principal and/or interest and continuing to accrue interest at any of the dates presented in this table.

Interest income on non-accrual loans is recognized on the cash basis until either the loan is paid-in full or the Bank determines after a significant payment history has been achieved to warrant the involved loan being classified as a performing loan and being returned to accruing status. There was $18,000 of such interest recognized during fiscal 2021 while there was $13,000, $123,000, $85,000 and $161,000 of such interest recognized for non-accrual loans for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Approximately $513,000 in additional interest income would have been recognized during the year ended September 30, 2021 if non-accrual loans had been performing during fiscal 2021.
At September 30, 2021, the Company’s non-performing assets totaled $12.5 million or 1.1% of total assets as compared to $13.0 million or 1.2% of total assets at September 30, 2020. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2021 included three construction loans aggregating $4.1 million, 18 single-family residential loans aggregating $3.0 million, and two commercial real estate loans aggregating $1.3 million. At September 30, 2021, the Company had two loans aggregating $1.1 million that were classified as TDRs, both of which are included in non-performing assets. One TDR is on non-accrual and consists of a $390,000 loan secured by a single-family property. The other TDR in the amount of $705,000 is also classified as non-accrual and is part of a non-performing lending relationship totaling $6.0 million (after taking into account the $1.9 million write-down recognized during fiscal 2018 related to this borrowing relationship and two other loans which became other real estate owned during the quarter ended June 30, 2021). The primary project of the borrower (the development of a 169-unit townhouse project in Bristol Borough, Pennsylvania) is the subject of litigation between the Bank and the borrower. Subsequent to the commencement of the litigation, the borrower filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 (Reorganization) of the federal bankruptcy code in September 2018. The Bank has moved the underlying litigation noted above with the borrower and the Bank from state court to the federal bankruptcy court in which the bankruptcy proceeding is being heard. The state litigation is stayed pending the resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. We maintain the allowance at a level believed, to the best of management’s knowledge, to cover all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at each reporting date. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses on no less than a quarterly basis in order to identify those inherent losses and to assess the overall collection probability for the loan portfolio. For each primary type of loan, we establish a loss factor reflecting an estimate of the known and inherent losses in such loan type using both a quantitative analysis as well as consideration of qualitative factors. Management’s evaluation process includes, among other things, an analysis of delinquency trends, non-performing loan trends, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, prior loss experience, total loans outstanding, the volume of loan originations, the type, size and geographic concentration of our loans, the value of collateral securing the loan, the borrower’s ability to repay and repayment performance, the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight, local economic conditions and industry experience.
The carrying value of loans is periodically evaluated and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. The establishment of the allowance for loan losses is significantly affected by management judgment and uncertainties and there is a likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments that differ from those of management. Loans acquired from Polonia Bancorp amounted to $160.8 million for which there is no allowance for loan losses because these loans were recorded at fair value upon completion of the merger as of January 1, 2017. A general credit mark of $2.3 million was recorded in connection with completion of the acquisition and is being amortized over 30 years. As of September 30, 2021, our allowance for loan losses of $8.5 million was 1.4% of total loans receivable and 101.6% of non-performing loans.

16



Charge-offs on loans totaled $40,000 and $144,000 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Management has taken a prudent approach in writing down all substandard loans to the net realizable value of the applicable underlying collateral.
Management will continue to monitor and modify the allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate. However, based on its comprehensive analysis, management believes that the amount maintained in the allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2021 is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio. No assurances can be given that the level of allowance for loan losses will cover all of the inherent losses on our loans or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses.

​
The aggregate allowance for loan losses increased by $214,000 from September 30, 2020 to September 30, 2021 due to a provision of $200,000 combined with net recoveries of $14,000 recorded during the period. The aggregate allowance for loan losses increased by $2.9 million from September 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020, due to a provision of $3.0 million partially offset by a net charge off of $115,000 recorded during the period. The aggregate allowance for loan losses increased by $226,000 from September 30, 2018 to September 30, 2019, due to a provision of $100,000 combined with a net recovery of $126,000 recorded during the period. Fluctuations in the allowance may occur based on management’s consideration of the known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio that are reasonably estimable as well as current qualitative and quantitative risk factors at the time of the analysis.
Investment Activities
General. We invest in securities in accordance with policies approved by our Board of Directors. The investment policy designates the President, COO, CFO and Controller as the Investment Committee, which is authorized by the Board to make the Bank’s investments consistent with the investment policy. The Board of Directors of the Bank reviews all investment activity on a monthly basis.
The investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, to complement the lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity. The current investment policy generally permits investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. agencies, municipal bonds, and corporate debt obligations, as well as investments in preferred and common stock of government agencies and government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (federal agency securities) and, to a lesser extent, other equity securities. Securities in these categories are classified as “investment securities” for financial reporting purposes. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae as well as collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) issued or backed by securities issued by these government sponsored agencies.
Ginnie Mae is a government agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development which is intended to help finance government-assisted housing programs. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The timely payment of principal and interest on Ginnie Mae securities is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. Freddie Mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. Fannie Mae is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Congress with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans. Fannie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on Fannie Mae securities. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.

18



Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve the risk that actual prepayments will be greater than estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Further, privately issued mortgage-backed securities and CMOs also have a higher risk of default due to adverse changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer. Management’s practice is generally to not invest in such securities. See further discussion in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein.
The Company has a portfolio of corporate debt securities with an investment grade rating from at least one national rating agency. In purchasing these types of securities, the Company looks for known publicly trading entities along with utilizing the credit department to underwrite each issuing entity as if it were a direct commercial loan. The mortgage-backed securities consist both of mortgage pass-through and CMOs guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
The Company has portfolio municipal and government subdivisions securities which are graded at least “A” by at least one national rating agency. The securities are exempt from taxation.
At September 30, 2021, the investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolio amounted to $326.0 million or 29.6% of total assets at such date. The largest component of the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2021 consisted of mortgage-backed securities which amounted to $139.6 million or 42.8% of the securities portfolio at September 30, 2021. In addition, we invest in corporate debt, state and political subdivisions, U.S Government and agency obligations and to a significantly lesser degree, other securities.
The securities are classified at the time of acquisition as available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Securities classified as held to maturity must be purchased with the intent and ability to hold that security until its final maturity, and can be sold prior to maturity only under rare circumstances. Held-to-maturity securities are accounted for based upon the amortized cost of the security. Available-for-sale securities can be sold at any time based upon needs or market conditions. Available-for-sale securities are accounted for at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of income tax provisions, reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2021, the Company had $20.1 million of investment and mortgage-backed securities classified as held to maturity, $305.9 million of investment and mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale and no securities classified as trading securities. At September 30, 2021, we had no investments in a single issuer other than securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, which had an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity.
The following table sets forth certain information relating to the investment and mortgage-backed and equity securities portfolios at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits, loan repayments and prepayments, proceeds from sales of loans, cash flows generated from operations and FHLB advances are the primary sources of funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes.
Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Deposits consist of checking, both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing, money market, savings and certificate of deposit accounts. At September 30, 2021, 44.5% of the funds deposited with the Bank were in core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit and funds acquired through a broker.
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. Retail deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas where the branch offices are located. We have historically relied primarily on customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits; however, market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect the Bank’s ability to attract and retain deposits. The interest rates offered on deposits are competitive in the market place.
The Bank uses traditional means of advertising its deposit products, including broadcast and print media and generally does not solicit deposits from outside its market area.

20



At September 30, 2021, jumbo cds (certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more) amounted to $168.4 million, of which $136.4 million are scheduled to mature within twelve months subsequent to such date. At September 30, 2021, the weighted average remaining period until maturity of the certificate of deposit accounts was 7.5 months. During fiscal 2021, jumbo cds from government agencies and other financial institutions and brokered deposits, were utilized to fund growth.

Borrowings. From time to time we utilize advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh as an alternative to retail deposits to fund the operations as part of the operating and liquidity strategy. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. These FHLB advances are collateralized primarily by certain mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and secondarily by an investment in capital stock of the FHLB of Pittsburgh. There are no specific credit covenants associated with these borrowings. FHLB advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The maximum amount that the FHLB of Pittsburgh will advance to member institutions, including the Bank, fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the FHLB of Pittsburgh. At September 30, 2021, the Bank had $232.0 million in outstanding advances with the FHLB, and had the ability to obtain additional advances in the amount of $101.7 million. The Bank utilized the FHLB advances to fund an investment leverage strategy along with funding growth in the loan and investment portfolios.

Subsidiaries
The Company has only one direct subsidiary: Prudential Bank. The Bank’s sole subsidiary as of September 30, 2021 was PSB Delaware, Inc. (“PSB”), a Delaware-chartered corporation established to hold investment securities. As of September 30, 2021, PSB had assets of $275.5 million primarily consisting of mortgage-backed and investment securities. We may consider the establishment of one or more additional subsidiaries in the future.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
At September 30, 2021, we had 88 full-time employees, and two part-time employees. None of such employees are represented by a collective bargaining group, and we believe that the Company’s relationship with its employees is good. We believe our ability to attract and retain employees is a key to the Bank’s success.
​
 Our human capital objectives include attracting, developing, and retaining the best available talent from a diverse pool of candidates for the Bank. To do so, we strive to maintain competitive pay and benefits, regularly updating our compensation structure and periodically reviewing our compensation and benefits programs. Additionally, the Bank identifies opportunities and paths for the development of our staff, and we seek to, whenever possible, fill positions by promotion from within. The Company recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the organization, and promotes training and continuing education as an ongoing function for employees.
​
We recognize the importance of our employee’s financial health and well-being, and offer benefits such as a 401(k) retirement savings plan and make both matching and profit-sharing contributions to that plan, which also includes the Company’s stock as an investment option. Benefit programs available to eligible employees include, besides the 401(k) retirement savings plan, health and life insurance, employee paid holidays and other benefits.
​
We value and promote diversity and inclusion in every aspect of our business and at every level within the company. We recruit, hire, and promote employees based on their individual ability and experience and in accordance with Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity laws and regulations. Our policy is that we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, ancestry, pregnancy, medical condition, age, marital status, national origin, citizenship status, disability, veteran status, gender identity, genetic information, or any other status protected by law. 
​
The Company is committed to the overall well-being of our team members. In the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked to implement state and local directives regarding public health. WE provided for remote working where possible. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and state and Pennsylvania guidance, making adjustments as necessary to support employees.
​
REGULATION
General
The Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank and is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Department”) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

23



(the “FDIC”), and is also subject to certain requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. The federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the payment of dividends, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. There are periodic examinations by the Department and the FDIC to test the Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or the Congress could have a material adverse impact on Prudential Bancorp and the Bank and their respective operations.
Federal law provides the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board, with substantial enforcement powers. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.
Prudential Bancorp is a registered as bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and by the Department. Prudential Bancorp files annually a report of its operations with, and is subject to examination by, the Federal Reserve Board and the Department. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that Prudential Bancorp limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of the Bank.
The common stock of Prudential Bancorp is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Prudential Bancorp is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions, and certain other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Prudential Bancorp’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “PBIP.” The Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements impose additional requirements on us, including, among other things, rules relating to corporate governance and the composition and independence of our Board of Directors and various committees of the Board, such as the audit committee.
Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and Prudential Bancorp are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and Prudential Bancorp and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.
2018 Regulatory Reform
In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “2018 Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). While the 2018 Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks such as the Bank.
The 2018 Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios. The Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” (the “SBHC Policy”) by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. This expansion also excludes such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the 2018 Act includes regulatory relief for 

24



community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
It is difficult at this time to predict how the new standards under the 2018 Act will ultimately affect the Bank or what specific impact the 2018 Act and the recently promulgated implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.
2010 Regulatory Reform
On July 21, 2010, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. The law also established an independent federal consumer protection bureau within the Federal Reserve Board. The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the law that may affect the Bank and Prudential Bancorp.
The following aspects of the financial reform and consumer protection act are related to the operations of the Bank:

● | A new independent consumer financial protection bureau was established, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) within the Federal Reserve Board, empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. Smaller financial institutions, like the Bank, are subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tier 1 capital treatment for “hybrid” capital items like trust preferred securities was eliminated subject to various grandfathering and transition rules.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deposit insurance on most accounts increased to $250,000.
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | The deposit insurance assessment base calculation now equals the depository institution’s total assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base; however, the FDIC is directed to “offset the effect” of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following aspects of the financial reform and consumer protection act are related to the operations of Prudential Bancorp:

● | The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The SEC is authorized to adopt rules requiring public companies to make their proxy materials available to shareholders for nomination of their own candidates for election to the board of directors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Public companies are now required to provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote: (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is now required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25




● | Securities exchanges are now required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain “significant” matters, which include votes on the election of directors and executive compensation matters.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stock exchanges are prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for (i) disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation payable on the basis of financial information reportable under the securities laws, and (ii) the recovery from current or former executive officers, following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements, of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disclosure in annual proxy materials will be required concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC will be amended to require companies (other than smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies) to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer’s annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Smaller reporting companies are exempt from complying with the internal control auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation of Prudential Bank
Pennsylvania Banking Law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 (the “Banking Code”) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, employees and members, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices.
One of the purposes of the Banking Code is to provide savings banks with the opportunity to be competitive with each other and with other financial institutions existing under other Pennsylvania laws and other state, federal and foreign laws. A Pennsylvania savings bank may locate or change the location of its principal place of business and establish an office anywhere in Pennsylvania, with the prior approval of the Department.
The Department generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Department may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of its own examination, the present practice is for the Department to alternate conducting examinations with the FDIC. The Department may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, trustee, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Department has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Department why such person should not be removed.
Insurance of Accounts. The deposits of the Bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. The Dodd-Frank Act increased deposit insurance on most accounts to $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions.
The Dodd Frank Act raises the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% and requires the FDIC to offset the effect of this increase on insured institutions with assets of less than $10 billion (small institutions). In March 2017, the FDIC adopted a rule to accomplish this by imposing a surcharge on larger institutions commencing when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and ending when it reaches 1.35%. The reserve ratio reached 1.15% 

26



effective as of June 30, 2017. This surcharge period became effective July 1, 2017 and ended on September 30, 2019 when the reserve ratio reached 1.36%. Small institutions will receive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The credits will apply to reduce regular assessments by 2.0 basis points for quarters when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. As of June 30, 2019 the reserve ratio reached 1.40% and small bank assessment credits were applied to FDIC insurance invoices. The Bank received a credit of $216,000. In 2020, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced that all credits had been remitted and that the credit program had ended.
Effective July 1, 2016 the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated its risk-based premium system. The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on the assessment base of a depository institution, which is their average total asset reduced by the amount of its average tangible equity. For a small institution (one with assets of less than $10 billion) that has been federally insured for at least five years, effective July 1, 2016, the initial base assessment rate ranges from 3 to 30 basis points, based on the institution’s CAMELS composite and component ratings and certain financial ratios: its leverage ratio; its ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; its ratio of nonperforming loans and leases to gross assets; its ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets; its brokered deposits ratio (excluding reciprocal deposits if the institution is well capitalized and has a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2); its one year asset growth ratio (which penalizes growth adjusted for mergers in excess of 10%); and its loan mix index (which penalizes higher risk loans based on historical industry charge off rates).  The initial base assessment rate is subject to downward adjustment (not below 1.5%) based on the ratio of unsecured debt the institution has issued to its assessment base, and to upward adjustment (which can cause the rate to exceed 30 basis points) based on its holdings of unsecured debt issued by other insured institutions. Institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are assessed using a scorecard method. 
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which could result in termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. Unless a community bank qualifies and elects to comply with the community bank leverage ratio (the “CBLR”) requirement described below, federal regulations require Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1capital to risk-based assets of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0% and a Tier 1 capital to average assets leverage ratio of 4.0%. In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction, an institution must also maintain greater than 2.5% in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer.
Effective January 1, 2020, qualifying community banking organizations may elect to comply with a greater than 9% community bank leverage ratio (the “CBLR”) requirement in lieu of the currently applicable requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios. The CBLR is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets. In order to qualify for the CBLR election, a community bank must (i) have a leverage capital ratio greater than 9 percent, (2) have less than $10 billion in average total consolidated assets, (3) not exceed certain levels of off-balance sheet exposure and trading assets plus trading liabilities and (4) not be an advanced approaches banking organization. A community bank that meets the above qualifications and elects to utilize the CBLR is considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules and is also considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. As of September 30, 2021, the Bank had not elected to be subject to the CBLR requirement.
The common equity Tier 1 capital component generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Under the risk-based capital requirement, “total” capital (a combination of core and 

27



“supplementary” capital). The FDIC also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis.
​
In determining compliance with the risk-based capital requirement, a savings bank is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital, provided that the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings bank’s core capital. Supplementary capital generally consists of general allowances for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, together with certain other items. In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk weight based on the risks inherent in the type of assets. The risk weights range from 0% for cash and securities issued by the U.S. Government or unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government to 100% for loans (other than qualifying residential loans weighted at 80%) and repossessed assets and to 150% for certain acquisition, development and construction loans and more than 90-day past due exposures.
​
Savings banks must value securities available for sale at amortized cost for regulatory capital purposes. This means that in computing regulatory capital, savings banks should add back any unrealized losses and deduct any unrealized gains, net of income taxes, on debt securities reported as a separate component of capital, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
At September 30, 2021, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, with Tier 1, Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 (to risk-weighted assets) and total risk-based capital ratios of 11.30%, 16.37%, 16.37% and 17.55%, respectively.
Any savings bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement action by the FDIC. Such action could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on the institution’s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. The FDIC’s capital regulations provide that such actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions.
Department Capital Requirements. The Bank is also subject to more stringent Department capital guidelines. Although not adopted in regulation form, the Department utilizes capital standards requiring a minimum of 6% leverage capital and 10% risk-based capital. The components of leverage and risk-based capital are substantially the same as those defined by the FDIC. At September 30, 2021, the Bank’s capital ratios exceeded each of its capital requirements.
Prompt Corrective Action. The following table shows the amount of capital associated with the different capital categories set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations (and does not take into account the potential determination to elect to use the CBLR).
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-------------------------------+---+-------------+---+-------------+---+---------------+---+-------------+--
​ | | Total | | Tier 1 | | Tier 1 | | Tier 1 | 
​ | ​ | Risk-Based | ​ | Risk-Based | ​ | Common Equity | ​ | Leverage | 
Capital Category | | Capital | | Capital | | Capital | | Capital | 
Well capitalized | | 10% or more | | 8% or more | | 6.5% or more | | 5% or more | ​
Adequately capitalized | | 8% or more | | 6% or more | | 4.5% or more | | 4% or more | ​
Undercapitalized | | Less than 8 | % | Less than 6 | % | Less than 4.5 | % | Less than 4 | %
Significantly undercapitalized | | Less than 6 | % | Less than 4 | % | Less than 3 | % | Less than 3 | %

​
In addition, an institution is “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Under specified circumstances, a federal banking agency may reclassify a “well capitalized” institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).
An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice 

28



of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the agency. An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. In addition, undercapitalized institutions are subject to various regulatory restrictions, and the appropriate federal banking agency also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions.
At September 30, 2021, the Bank was deemed to be a “well capitalized” institution for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions.

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks and Savings Banks. The activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks and savings banks are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks or a federal savings association. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank or savings bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank or a federal savings association. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things:

● | acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary;
--+------------------------------------------------------------

29




● | investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’, trustees’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDIC has adopted regulations pertaining to the other activity restrictions imposed upon insured state-chartered banks and savings banks and their subsidiaries. Pursuant to such regulations, insured state banks and savings banks engaging in impermissible activities may seek approval from the FDIC to continue such activities. State banks and savings banks not engaging in such activities but that desire to engage in otherwise impermissible activities either directly or through a subsidiary may apply for approval from the FDIC to do so; however, if such bank fails to meet the minimum capital requirements or the activities present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds, such application will not be approved by the FDIC. Pursuant to this authority, the FDIC has determined that investments in certain majority-owned subsidiaries of insured state-chartered banks and savings banks do not represent a significant risk to the deposit insurance funds. Investments permitted under that authority include real estate activities and securities activities.
Restrictions on Capital Distributions. Under federal rules, an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it is already undercapitalized. In addition, federal regulators have the authority to restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends for safety and soundness reasons. The FDIC also prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its capital notes or debentures (if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits) or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the FDIC. The Bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the FDIC. Pennsylvania law also restricts the payment and amount of dividends, including the requirement that dividends be paid only out of accumulated net earnings.
Incentive Compensation. Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the FDIA prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder.
In January 2010, the FDIC announced that it would seek public comment on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged. The comment period ended in February 2010. As of September 30, 2021, a final rule has not been adopted.
In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies (the “Incentive Compensation Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The Incentive Compensation Guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

30



In April 2011, the federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published proposed rulemaking designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking. Those proposed regulations apply only to a financial institution or its holding company with $1 billion or more of assets. In June 2016, the federal banking agencies and the SEC published a new proposed rule to implement these provisions.
The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop. It cannot be determined at this time whether a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will adversely affect the ability of Prudential Bancorp and the Bank to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.
Privacy Requirements. Federal law places limitations on financial institutions like the Bank regarding the sharing of consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, these provisions require all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. The Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes such policy is in compliance with applicable regulations.
Anti-Money Laundering. Federal anti-money laundering rules impose various requirements on financial institutions to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. These provisions include a requirement that financial institutions operating in the United States have anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. The Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the federal anti-money laundering provisions.
UDAP and UDAAP. Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address “unethical” or otherwise “bad” business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”), which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as UDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. “Unjustified consumer injury” is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd- Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,” referred to as UDAAP, which have been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has published its first Supervision and Examination Manual that addresses compliance with and the examination of UDAAP. The potential reach of the CFPB’s broad new rulemaking powers and UDAAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Bank is currently unknown.
Community Reinvestment Act. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in restrictions on its activities. The Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination.
Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Pennsylvania-chartered savings banks are subject to a variety of federal statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including the imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations.
​

31



USA PATRIOT Act. The Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gave federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provided measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
Other Regulations. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The deposit operations of the Bank also are subject to, among others, the:

• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank.
As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh in an amount in accordance with the Federal Home Loan Bank’s capital plan and sufficient to ensure that the Federal Home Loan Bank remains in compliance with its minimum capital requirements. At September 30, 2021, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, which are primarily checking and NOW accounts, and non-personal time deposits. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board may be used to satisfy the liquidity requirements that are imposed by the Department. At September 30, 2021, the 

32



Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements. On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement to 0% effective as of March 26, 2020, which eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.
​
Regulation of Prudential Bancorp
Bank Holding Company Act Activities and Other Limitations. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, Prudential Bancorp must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire control of another bank or bank holding company, merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, Prudential Bancorp would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of such shares.
Federal statutes impose restrictions on the ability of a bank holding company and its nonbank subsidiaries to obtain extensions of credit from its subsidiary bank, on the subsidiary bank’s investments in the stock or securities of the holding company, and on the subsidiary bank’s taking of the holding company’s stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prevented from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services by the subsidiary bank.
A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board regulations, or both. The Dodd-Frank Act included a provision that directs federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. To date, no regulations have been promulgated to implement that provision.
Non-Banking Activities. The business activities of Prudential Bancorp, as a bank holding company, are restricted by the Bank Holding Company Act. Under the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s bank holding company regulations, bank holding companies may only engage in, or acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged in:

● | banking or managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the Bank Holding Company Act; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any Bank Holding Company Act activity the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related that it is incidental to banking or managing or controlling banks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation that certain activities are closely related to banking including operating a mortgage company, finance company, credit card company, factoring company, trust company or savings association; performing certain data processing operations; providing limited securities brokerage services; acting as an investment or financial advisor; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing personal property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; providing tax planning and preparation services; operating a collection agency; and providing certain courier services. Moreover, as discussed below, certain other activities are permissible for a bank holding company that becomes a financial holding company.
Financial Holding Companies. Bank holding companies may also engage in a broad range of activities under a type of financial services company known as a “financial holding company.” A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities 

33



underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The Federal Reserve Board and the Department of the Treasury are also authorized to permit additional activities for financial holding companies if the activities are “financial in nature” or “incidental” to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, well managed, and has at least a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. Prudential Bancorp has not submitted notices to the Federal Reserve Board of its intent to be deemed a financial holding company. However, it is not precluded from submitting a notice in the future should it wish to engage in activities only permitted to financial holding companies.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding company, on a consolidated basis, are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the FDIC. See “-Regulation of Prudential Bank - Capital Requirements.” Moreover, certain of the bank holding company capital requirements promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 became effective as of January 1, 2017. Those requirements establish four minimum capital ratios that Prudential Bancorp had to comply with as of that date as set forth in the table below. However, in May 2016, amendments to the Federal Reserve Board’s SBHC Policy became effective which increased the asset threshold to qualify to utilize the provisions of the SBHC Policy from $500 million to $1.0 billion. Subsequently, as part of the 2018 Act, the threshold was increased to $3.0 billion. Bank holding companies which are subject to the SBHC Policy are not subject to compliance with the regulatory capital requirements set forth in the table below until they exceed $3.0 billion in assets. As a consequence, as of September 30, 2021, Prudential Bancorp was not required to comply with the requirements set forth below until such time that its consolidated total assets exceed $3.0 billion or the Federal Reserve Board determines that Prudential Bancorp is no longer deemed to be a small bank holding company. However, if Prudential Bancorp had been subject to the requirements, it would have been in compliance with such requirements.
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----------------------------+---+--------------------+--
Capital Ratio | | Regulatory Minimum | 
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital | ​ | 4.5 | %
Tier 1 Leverage Capital | | 4.0 | %
Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital | | 6.0 | %
Total Risk-Based Capital | | 8.0 | %

​
The leverage capital requirement is calculated as a percentage of total assets and the other three capital requirements are calculated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. For a more detailed discussion of the 2013 capital rules, see “Recent Regulatory Capital Regulations” under “Regulation of Prudential Bank” above.
Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchases. Prudential Bancorp’s ability to declare and pay dividends may depend in part on dividends received from the Bank. The Banking Code regulates the distribution of dividends by savings banks and states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid out of accumulated net earnings, provided that the bank continues to meet its surplus requirements. In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if the Bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the FDIC.
A Federal Reserve Board policy statement on the payment of cash dividends states that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policy statement also provides that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.” See “-Regulation of Prudential Bank - Prompt Corrective Action” above.
Section 225.4(b)(1) of Regulation Y promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board requires that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, provide prior 

34



notice to the Federal Reserve Board for any repurchase or redemption of its equity securities for cash or other value that would reduce by 10 percent or more the bank holding company’s consolidated net worth aggregated over the preceding 12-month period. The Federal Reserve Bank may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
Federal Securities Laws. Prudential Bancorp’s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Prudential Bancorp is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions, and certain other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a public company, Prudential Bancorp is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
Volcker Rule Regulations. Regulations have been adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institutions holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. Recently promulgated federal regulations exclude from the Volcker Rule restrictions community banks with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of five percent or less of total consolidated assets. Prudential Bancorp qualifies for the exclusion from the Volcker Rule restrictions.
Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between insured financial institutions and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of an insured financial institution is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the insured financial institution. In a bank holding company context, the bank holding company of an insured financial institution (such as Prudential Bancorp) and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the insured financial institution. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the insured financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the insured financial institution, as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by an insured financial institution to an affiliate.
In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% stockholder of an insured financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of either, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the insured financial institution’s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the institution and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal stockholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the insured financial institution. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by an insured financial institution to all insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 

35



22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. At September 30, 2021, the Bank was in compliance with the above restrictions.
TAXATION
Federal Taxation
General. Prudential Bancorp and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions listed below. The following discussion of federal, state and local income taxation is only intended to summarize certain pertinent income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the applicable tax rules. During fiscal 2021, the Internal Revenue Service had concluded an audit of the Company’s tax returns for the year ended September 30, 2016 and no adverse findings were noted. The federal and state income tax returns for taxable years through September 30, 2016 have been closed for purposes of examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.
Prudential Bancorp files a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank and its subsidiary, PSB. Any distributions made by Prudential Bancorp to its shareholders generally will be treated as cash dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Prudential Bancorp and the Bank report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and file their federal income tax return on a fiscal year basis.
Bad Debt Reserves. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings associations, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. Prior to that time, the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income. As a result of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, savings associations must use the specific charge-off method in computing their bad debt deduction beginning with their 1996 federal tax return. In addition, federal legislation required the recapture over a six year period of the excess of tax bad debt reserves at December 31, 1995 over those established as of December 31, 1987.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. New federal legislation eliminated these savings association related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to recapture should the Bank make certain non-dividend distributions or cease to maintain a bank charter.
At September 30, 2021, the total federal pre-1988 reserve was approximately $6.6 million. The reserve reflects the cumulative effects of federal tax deductions by the Bank for which no federal income tax provisions have been made.
Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum tax income is in excess of the regular income tax. Net operating losses, of which the Bank has none, can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. The Bank has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax.
Corporate Dividends Received Deduction. Prudential Bancorp may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is 80% in the case of dividends received from corporations which a corporate recipient owns less than 80%, but at least 20% of the distribution corporation. Corporations which own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70% of dividends received.

State and Local Taxation
Pennsylvania Taxation. Prudential Bancorp is subject to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax and the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax. The Corporation Net Income Tax rate for 2021 is 9.99% and is imposed on unconsolidated taxable income for federal purposes with certain adjustments. In general, the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax is a property tax imposed on a corporation’s capital stock value at a statutorily defined rate, such value being determined in accordance with a fixed formula based upon average net income and net worth.
The Bank is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax Act, as amended to include thrift institutions having capital stock. Pursuant to the Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, the tax rate is 11.50%. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax exempts Prudential Savings from other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for state income tax purposes and from all local taxation imposed by political subdivisions, except taxes on real estate and real estate transfers. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax is a tax upon net earnings, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, in computing income according to generally accepted accounting principles, allows for the deduction of interest earned on state and federal obligations, while disallowing a percentage of a thrift’s interest expense deduction in the proportion of interest income on those securities to the overall interest income of the Bank. Net operating losses, if any, thereafter can be carried forward three years for Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax purposes.
​
In addition, as a savings bank conducting business in Philadelphia, the Bank is also subject to the City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax. The City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax is a tax upon net income or taxable receipts imposed on persons carrying on or exercising for gain or profit certain business activities within Philadelphia. Pursuant to the City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax, the 2021 tax rate was 6.20% on net income and 0.145% on gross receipts. For regulated industry taxpayers, the tax is the lesser of the tax on net income or the tax on gross receipts. The City of Philadelphia Business Privilege Tax allows for the deduction by financial businesses from receipts of (a) the cost of securities and other intangible property and monetary metals sold, exchanged, paid at maturity or redeemed, but only to the extent of the total gross receipts from securities and other intangible property and monetary metals sold, exchanged, paid out at maturity or redeemed; (b) moneys or credits received in repayment of the principal amount of deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations; (c) interest received on account of deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations made to persons resident or having their principal place of business outside Philadelphia;(d) interest received on account of other deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations but only to the extent of interest expenses attributable to such deposits, advances, credits, loans and other obligations; and (e) payments received on account of shares purchased by stockholders. An apportioned net operating loss may be carried forward for three tax years following the tax year for which it was first reported.
