We acquired the rights to the name “Bally’s” in 2020 as part of our strategy to become a leading U.S. full-service sports betting/iGaming company with physical casinos and online gaming solutions united under a single, prominent brand. We have taken other key steps to build our iGaming and sports betting business in the past year, including:
•entering into a strategic partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group (“Sinclair”) to leverage the Bally’s brand and combine our sports betting technology with Sinclair’s expansive natural footprint, which includes 188 local TV stations, 19 regional sports networks, the STIRR streaming service, the Tennis Channel and five stadium digital TV and internet sports networks; and 
•signing definitive agreements to acquire Bet.Works, a sports betting platform provider to operators in Colorado, New Jersey, Indiana and Iowa, and Monkey Knife Fight (“MKF”), the third-largest fantasy sports platform in North America. 
•acquiring SportsCaller, a leading B2B free-to-play (“FTP”) game provider, in early 2021.
We are a Delaware corporation with our global headquarters in Providence, Rhode Island.
Our Operating Structure
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had ten operating segments; Twin River Casino Hotel, Hard Rock Biloxi, Dover Downs, Tiverton Casino Hotel, Black Hawk Casinos, Casino KC, Casino Vicksburg, Bally’s Atlantic City, Shreveport and Mile High USA. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, we changed our reportable segments to better align with our strategic growth initiatives in light of recent and pending acquisitions. For purposes of financial reporting, our operating properties have been aggregated into the following four reportable segments: 
•Rhode Island - includes Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel. 
•Mid-Atlantic - includes Dover Downs and Bally’s Atlantic City 
•Southeast - includes Hard Rock Biloxi, Casino Vicksburg and Shreveport
•West - includes Casino KC and the Black Hawk Casinos. 
The Company reports Mile High USA, an immaterial operating segment, and shared services provided by Twin River Management Group (our management subsidiary), in the “Other” category. 
Prior to the onset of COVID-19, our properties generated strong free cash flow driven by income growth and low maintenance capital expenditures. Our Rhode Island and Delaware casinos do not bear the costs of slot machine acquisitions, replacements or maintenance, as these responsibilities are borne by the state, in each case, and are paid for, in effect, by these states’ gaming taxes on slot machine revenue.
Our casino operations are all within the U.S. Refer to Note 18 “Segment Reporting” to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 for additional information.
Our Strategy
Recent and Pending Acquisitions
We seek to continue to grow our business by actively pursuing the acquisition and development of new gaming opportunities and reinvesting in our existing operations. We believe that interactive gaming, including mobile sports betting and iGaming represents a significant strategic opportunity for future growth of the Company. In addition, we seek to increase revenues at our brick and mortar casinos through enhancing the guest experience by providing popular games, restaurants, hotel accommodations, entertainment and other amenities in attractive surroundings with high-quality guest service.
Our recent and pending business acquisitions include:
•Dover Downs - On March 28, 2019, we completed our merger with Dover Downs, with Dover Downs becoming our indirect wholly owned subsidiary and Dover Downs shareholders receiving common stock of Bally’s representing 7.225% of the equity of the combined company at closing. 
•Black Hawk Casinos - On January 23, 2020 we acquired three casino properties in Black Hawk, Colorado (Golden Gates, Golden Gulch and Mardi Gras) from a subsidiary of Affinity Gaming (“Affinity”) for $53.8 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. On November 5, 2019, Proposition DD was passed by the voters of Colorado, legalizing sports gambling in the state. As a result of this new legislation, we received three sports betting licenses in Colorado through the acquisition of the Black Hawk Casinos. We have entered into separate agreements with DraftKings Inc. and FanDuel Group to provide sportsbook products through these licenses. 
•Casino KC and Casino Vicksburg - On July 1, 2020, we acquired Casino KC in Kansas City, Missouri and Casino Vicksburg in Vicksburg, Mississippi for $229.9 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments from Eldorado Resorts, Inc., (“Eldorado”). (Eldorado subsequently merged with Caesars Entertainment Corporation and formed Caesars Entertainment Inc (“Caesars”)).
•Bally’s Atlantic City - On November 18, 2020, we acquired Bally’s Atlantic City from Caesars and Vici Properties Inc. along with the license to build out a sports book and launch online sports and internet gaming for $24.7 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
•Shreveport - On December 23, 2020, we acquired Eldorado Resort Casino Shreveport in Shreveport, Louisiana for $137.2 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, from Caesars.
•SportCaller - On February 5, 2021, we acquired SportCaller, one of the leading B2B free-to-play (“FTP”) game providers for sports betting and media companies across North America, the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, LATAM and Africa, for $24.0 million in cash and 221,391 shares of our common stock (valued at approximately $12.0 million), subject to adjustment, and up to $12.0 million in value of additional shares if SportCaller meets certain post-closing performance targets (calculated based on an exchange ratio of 0.8334).
•MontBleu - On April 24, 2020, we agreed to acquire MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa operations in Lake Tahoe, Nevada for $15.0 million, subject to post-closing adjustments, from Caesars, subject to required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.
•Jumer’s Casino & Hotel - On September 30, 2020, we agreed with Delaware North Companies Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. to acquire Jumer’s Casino & Hotel in Rock Island, Illinois for $120.0 million in cash, subject to required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.
•Tropicana Evansville - On October 27, 2020, we agreed with Caesars to acquire the Tropicana Evansville Casino in Evansville, Indiana for a purchase price of $140.0 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.
At the same time, an affiliate of Gaming & Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”) agreed to acquire the real estate associated with the Tropicana Evansville Casino for $340.0 million and lease it back to us for $28.0 million per year, subject to escalation. GLPI also agreed to acquire the real estate associated with our Dover Downs casino for $144.0 million and lease it back to us for $12.0 million per year, subject to escalation. Both leases are governed by a master lease agreement with GLPI which has an initial term of 15 years with four five-year renewal options. Refer to Note 5. “Acquisitions” for further information.
•Bet.Works - On November 18, 2020, we agreed to acquire Bet.Works, a sportsbook technology platform, for $62.5 million in cash and 2,528,194 common shares, subject in each case to customary adjustments. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals.
•Monkey Knife Fight - On January 22, 2021, we agreed to acquire MKF for (1) immediately exercisable penny warrants to purchase up to 984,450 Bally’s common shares (subject to adjustment) at closing and (2) contingent penny warrants to purchase up to 787,550 additional common shares half of which are issuable on each of the first and second anniversary of closing. The total value of the warrants at signing was $90.0 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.
We believe these acquisitions have expanded and will, in the case of the pending acquisitions, further expand both our operating and digital/interactive footprints, provide us access to the potentially lucrative interactive mobile sports betting and iGaming markets, and diversify us from a financial standpoint, while continuing to mitigate our susceptibility to regional economic downturns, idiosyncratic regulatory changes and increases in regional competition.
Other Strategic Initiatives 
Bally’s Trade Name 
On October 13, 2020, we acquired the Bally’s brand name and related rights from Caesars and changed our name to Bally’s Corporation. We began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) as “BALY” shortly thereafter. We believe Bally’s is an iconic brand that is commensurate with the premier properties and amenities that define our diversified portfolio. We believe that the “Bally’s” trade name brand has a rich history of gaming and entertainment that will provide immediate and enhanced nationwide brand recognition.
With our Sinclair media partnership and our interactive acquisitions, we have targeted growth in regional gaming, mobile and iGaming segments with the goal of becoming an industry leader in these segments in the U.S. Our rapidly growing footprint will now allow us to serve the over 80 million customers that reside within the markets for our soon to be 14 premier casino properties. With the Bally brand, media partnership and the unencumbered skins, or gaming licenses, we have acquired and reserved in our portfolio, we can now provide omni-channel offerings across our various physical properties while having a singular online and mobile presence with a brand that is synonymous with gaming entertainment. 
Bally Interactive
Upon acquiring Bet.Works’ proprietary technology stack and turnkey solutions, which include marketing, operations, customer service, risk management and compliance, we believe we will position ourselves to become a leading, full-service, vertically integrated sports betting and iGaming company in the U.S. with physical casinos and online gaming solutions united under a single, leading brand, thus enabling it to launch our B2B2C business model. The Bet.Works acquisition, which complements these initiatives, will provide us with a suite of advanced omni-channel products, platforms, software and content solutions that we expect will position us to deliver unrivaled sports betting and iGaming offerings to customers on a national scale. Complementing the Bet.Works transactions are our announced pending acquisition of MKF and completed acquisition of SportCaller. These acquisitions provide us with the platforms to broaden our interactive offerings to include daily fantasy sports and FTP options which will both generate revenue as well as serve to increase our player database. In addition to providing additional offerings for Bally’s, SportCaller, similar to Bet.Works, also already includes an established B2B solutions and revenue stream. 
Strategic Partnership - Sinclair Broadcast Group
Our agreements with Sinclair provide for a long-term strategic partnership for up to 20 years that combines our vertically integrated, proprietary sports betting technology and expansive market access footprint with Sinclair’s premier portfolio of local broadcast stations and live regional sports networks (“RSNs”), STIRR streaming service, its popular Tennis Channel, and digital and over-the-air television network Stadium. Bally’s and Sinclair will partner to create unrivaled sports gamification content on a national scale, positioning Bally’s as a leading omni-channel gaming company with physical casinos and online sports betting and iGaming solutions united under a single brand. 
We plan to integrate Bally’s content into the 190 television stations that Sinclair owns, operates or provides services to across 88 markets and its regional sports networks. Our plan is to jointly market, design and integrate products on a state-by-state basis, and deliver online gaming experiences to local audiences. The Sinclair partnership, along with our acquisition of Bet.Works’ iGaming technology platform, brings the opportunity to integrate media and technology into our traditional, regional land-based casino footprint. 
Refer to Note 9 “Sinclair Agreement” for more information on the Sinclair transaction.
Proposed Partnership with IGT in Rhode Island
On January 30, 2020, we announced an agreement in principle to form a joint venture (“JV”) with International Gaming Technology PLC (“IGT”) to become a licensed technology provider and supply the State of Rhode Island with all video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) at both Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel for a 20-year period starting July 1, 2022. IGT would own 60% of the joint venture. In addition, our master contract with Rhode Island would be extended on existing terms until June 30, 2043, and we would commit to investing $100 million in Rhode Island over this extended term, including an expansion and the addition of new amenities at Twin River Casino Hotel. This proposed agreement requires the Rhode Island State Legislature to enact legislation for the state to enter into or amend contracts with us. The agreement in principle would also result in changes to our Regulatory Agreement in Rhode Island, including an increase in the ratios applicable to us and greater flexibility to complete sale-leaseback transactions. We expect this legislation will be adopted later in 2021, although there can be no assurance of this.
Centre County, Pennsylvania Development 
On December 31, 2020, we signed a framework agreement with entities affiliated with an established developer to design, develop, construct and manage a Category 4 licensed casino in Centre County, Pennsylvania. Construction of the casino is expected to begin in 2021 and will take approximately one year to complete. Subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, it will house up to 750 slot machines and 30 table games. The casino will also provide, subject to receipt of separate licenses and certificates, retail sports betting, online sports betting and online gaming. The Company estimates the total cost of the project, including construction, licensing and sports betting/iGaming operations, to be approximately $120 million. If completed, we will acquire a majority equity interest in the partnership, including 100% of the economic interests of all retail sports betting, online sports betting and iGaming activities associated with the project.
Richmond, Virginia Proposal
On February 22, 2021, we submitted a proposal to the City of Richmond, Virginia (“Richmond”) to develop and operate a world class destination resort, hotel and casino. The proposed project would span more than 1.6 million square feet and include a casino, sportsbook, hotel, pool, dining and retail outlets, and a flexible space for live entertainment and conferences. We estimate that the total investment for this project will be approximately $650 million and will be supported by several strategic partnerships. 
Properties
As of February 19, 2021, we own and manage 12 properties; 11 casinos across seven states, a horse racetrack and 13 authorized off-track betting (“OTB”) licenses in Colorado. Our operations include 12,890 slot machines, 443 game tables and 2,904 hotel rooms. Information relating to the location and general characteristics of our properties is provided in “Item 2. Properties”.
Following the completion of our pending acquisitions, as well as the construction of a land-based casino in Centre County, Pennsylvania, we will own 16 properties across 11 states.
Intellectual Property
As of February 19, 2021, we own 34 trademarks and have 12 pending applications for trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
As part of our acquisition of the Hard Rock Biloxi in July 2014, Hard Rock Biloxi entered into an amendment to the existing license agreement with Hard Rock Hotel, Licensing, Inc., which originally provided for an initial term of 20 years through September 2025 and the option to renew for two successive ten-year terms. Under the license agreement, we have the exclusive right to use the “Hard Rock” brand name in connection with, and as it relates to, the Hard Rock Biloxi property for an annual fee.
See discussion of our acquisition of the Bally’s trade name under “Other Strategic Initiatives - Bally’s Trade Name” above.
Competition
The gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of operators, including land-based casinos, riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, video lotteries, video gaming terminals at taverns in certain states, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, emerging varieties of Internet and fantasy sports gaming, increased sports betting and other forms of gaming in the U.S. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from many leisure and entertainment activities, including, for example: shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms in different parts of the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on many lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and First Nations in Canada. We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our properties compete directly with other gaming properties in each state in which we operate, as well as in adjacent states. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all. We believe that increased legalized gaming in other states, particularly in areas close to our existing gaming properties and the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or future development projects. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information on competition.
Government Gaming Regulation
General
The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated and we must maintain licenses and pay gaming taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate in order to continue operations. Each of our facilities is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions. 
Some jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
Under provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restrictions on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable, to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities.
For a more detailed description of regulations to which we are subject, see Exhibit 99.1, to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The Regulatory Agreement
On November 13, 2019, certain of our subsidiaries, the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue amended and restated our Regulatory Agreement (the “Regulatory Agreement”), replacing the previous regulatory agreement dated July 1, 2016. The Regulatory Agreement sets forth certain requirements with respect to the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation’s regulatory oversight of us. The Regulatory Agreement contains financial and other covenants that, among other things, (1) restrict the acquisition of stock and other financial interests in us, (2) relate to the licensing and composition of members of our management and Board of Directors (the “Board”), (3) prohibit certain competitive activities and related-party transactions, and (4) restrict our ability to declare or make restricted payments (including dividends), or incur additional indebtedness, or take certain other actions, if our leverage ratio exceeds 4.75 to 1.00 (in general being gross debt divided by EBITDA as defined in the Regulatory Agreement). This ratio level is subject to potential reduction after June 30, 2021.
The Regulatory Agreement also provides affirmative obligations, including setting a minimum number of employees that we must employ in Rhode Island and providing the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue with periodic information updates about us. Among other things, the Regulatory Agreement prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing or providing gaming specific goods and services to any properties in Rhode Island (other than Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire. Termination of the Regulatory Agreement may be effected by us if we are no longer involved in the ownership or management of the Lincoln or Tiverton facilities, among other events. A failure to comply with the provisions in the Regulatory Agreement could subject us to injunctive or monetary relief, payments to the Rhode Island regulatory agencies and ultimately the revocation or suspension of our licenses to operate in Rhode Island.
On October 6, 2020, we and the Rhode Island regulatory authorities amended the Regulatory Agreement to clarify the leverage ratio and capital expenditure requirements in light of COVID-related closures and curtailments. Under the amendments, in general, we are authorized to establish Adjusted EBITDA amounts by reference to pre-COVID performance levels, by property, for purposes of calculating compliance with the maximum leverage ratio, until such time as that property has no further COVID-related restrictions or its performance exceeds pre-COVID levels. This method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of determining the leverage ratio applies to all existing properties as well as all properties acquired in the future. In addition, the amendments allowed us to defer required capital expenditures from 2020 until 2021, and provides the State of Rhode Island discretion to further defer some of the required capital expenditures into 2022 depending on capital expenditure levels in 2021 and other factors.
Other Laws and Regulations
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
The sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
Human Capital Resources 
Employee Relations, Diversity and Social Inclusion 
We pride ourselves on providing an outstanding guest experience and we recognize that we must attract and retain employees who are committed to this vision. We support the professional development of our employees through training programs, scholarships, wellness initiatives and tuition reimbursement opportunities. We also have programs in place to recognize our employees’ contributions to the workplace to reinforce that we value them and their contributions. To promote and foster a culture of inclusion, our properties have hiring initiatives that are aimed at increasing diversity and promoting gender equality and we welcome employees and guests of all backgrounds. We believe in the importance of giving back to our communities and have several philanthropic initiatives, including fundraising events to support local charities and organizations and community service events.
Labor Relations 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 5,455 employees. Most of our employees in Rhode Island and New Jersey are represented by a labor union and are subject to collective bargaining agreements with us. As of such date, we had 19 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 2,281 employees. Three collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire in 2021 and we are currently renegotiating one collective bargaining agreement that has expired, covering 806 employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to extend or enter into replacement agreements. If we are able to extend or enter into replacement agreements, there can be no assurance as to whether the terms will be on comparable terms to the existing agreements. Employees in Delaware, Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana and Colorado are not represented by any labor union.
Seasonality
Casino, hotel and racing operations in our markets are subject to seasonal variation. Seasonal weather conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to each of our properties and may cause flooding and other effects that result in the closure of our properties. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
