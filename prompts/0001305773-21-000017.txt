ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a medical technology company that uses our proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell joint replacement implants and instruments that are individually sized and shaped, which we refer to as personalized, individualized, or sometimes as customized, to fit each patient's unique anatomy. The worldwide market for joint replacement products is approximately $19.5 billion annually and growing. We believe our iFit technology platform is applicable to all major joints in this market. 
We offer a broad line of personalized knee implants and instruments designed to restore the natural shape of a patient’s knee. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold a total of more than 125,000 knee implants worldwide, including more than 100,000 total knee implants and 25,000 partial knee implants. In multiple clinical studies, iTotal CR, our cruciate-retaining total knee replacement implant and best-selling product, demonstrated superior clinical outcomes, including better function, including kinematics and objective functional measures, and greater patient satisfaction compared to those of standard, or “off-the-shelf,” implants that it was tested against. In 2016, we initiated the broad commercial launch of the iTotal PS, our posterior-stabilized total knee replacement implant which addresses the largest segment of the knee replacement market. In the second half of 2021, we plan to launch a new standard knee offering, which is being designed to provide a lower-cost alternative to hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), while still taking full advantage of years of patient data collected through Conformis’ unique business model. We are planning for a limited commercial launch of our cementless or Press Fit option for our iTotal Identity knee implant beginning during the fourth quarter of 2021 and/or first quarter of 2022, with the full commercial launch planned by the second half of 2022.
In July 2018, our first Conformis Hip Systems were implanted in a limited commercial launch. On November 11, 2019, we entered full commercial launch of the Conformis Hip System. We are planning for a limited commercial launch of a second stem for the Conformis Hip System in the first half of 2022. In September 2020, we announced the new Cordera™ Hip System, and in December 2020, we commenced the U.S. commercial launch of the new Cordera™ Match Hip System, one of multiple planned product extensions featuring the Cordera™ Hip System. 
Our iFit technology platform comprises three key elements:
•iFit Design, our proprietary algorithms and computer software that we use to design personalized implants and associated single-use, patient-specific instrumentation, which we refer to as iJigs, based on a computed tomography, or CT, scan of the patient and to prepare a surgical plan personalized for the patient that we call iView.
•iFit Printing, a three-dimensional, or 3D, printing technology that we use to manufacture iJigs and that we may extend to manufacture certain components of our personalized knee replacement implants.
•iFit Just-in-Time Delivery, our just-in-time manufacturing and delivery capabilities.
We believe our iFit technology platform enables a scalable business model that greatly lowers our inventory requirements, reduces the amount of working capital required to support our operations and allows us to launch new products and product improvements more rapidly, as compared to manufacturers of off-the-shelf implants. Manufacturers of traditional knee replacement implants offer products with a limited range of sizes and geometries, which we refer to as off-the-shelf implants. Off-the-shelf implants are not designed to restore a particular patient's unique anatomy. 
Based on clinical data developed independently by orthopedic surgeons comparing our iTotal CR and PS to off-the-shelf total knee replacement implants, as well as our own research and the common approach we employ in the design and manufacture of our products, we believe that our personalized joint replacement implants offer significant benefits to patients, surgeons and hospitals and other medical facilities that are not afforded by off-the-shelf implants.
•For the patient.  We believe that our individualized approach offers better clinical outcomes when compared to off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures:
▪Better fit.  We design our personalized joint implants to restore each patient's own native anatomy. As a result, we believe that our implants fit better.
•Faster recovery.  We believe an individual fit requires less bone and soft tissue removal by the surgeon, thereby shortening recovery times.
•Better function.  We design our personalized implants to follow the particular shape and contour of each patient's joint. As a result, we believe our implants offer an increased potential for a knee or hip that moves more naturally and is more stable.
•Greater patient satisfaction.  We believe our implants offer patients greater overall satisfaction with the results of their knee or hip replacement.
A study of 63 knee replacement surgeries, utilizing our iTotal CR total knee replacement system, published in 2017 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Knee Surgery, or 2017 JOKS, indicates that 84% of patients achieved perfect neutral coronal mechanical alignment after surgery, and that 100% of patients were within the desired alignment range after surgery. At the time the 2017 JOKS Study was conducted, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us. Similarly, a prior retrospective study of 200 knee replacement surgeries published in 2014 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Arthroplasty, or the 2014 JOA Study, indicated that our iTotal CR implant was 1.8 times more likely to be in the desired alignment range after surgery than an off-the-shelf implant. At the time the 2014 JOA Study was conducted, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us. A study published in May 2018 in The Journal of Knee Surgery, a peer-reviewed orthopedic journal, entitled “In Vivo Tibial Fit and Rotational Analysis of a Customized, Patient-Specific TKA versus Off-the-Shelf TKA,” indicated that the iTotal CR knee replacement implant provided better rotational alignment and tibial fit compared to off-the-shelf implants (i.e., non-personalized). We provided financial support for this study and the author is a paid consultant of ours on other matters. In addition, in a September 2020 report from Beyond Compliance, results were presented summarizing six-year data from the England and Wales National Joint Registry demonstrating high survivorship in patients treated with the iTotal CR knee replacement implant, specifically the data showed a low cumulative percent revision of 1.6% for Conformis patients as compared with 2.4% for all total knee replacement patients. A clinical research study published online in July 2020 in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery Reviews found that the patients studied, who all received Conformis patient-specific iTotal PS (posterior-stabilized) knee replacement implants, were 90% satisfied, or very satisfied, 18–28 months post-surgery.
•For the surgeon.  We believe that the combination of the use of our pre-surgical plan, or iView, and patient-specific iJigs with our personalized joint replacement implants enables a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of required steps and increasing the precision of the placement of the implant. With regard to our Conformis Hip System, our pre-operative surgical plan, or Hip iView, provides anatomical information to surgeons in advance of surgery that is not available today through the use of standard templating tools. In addition, surgeons have input into our hip system designs within a defined range of parameters to allow surgeons to optimize the Conformis Hip System for each patient, including allowing for leg length correction. An acetabular positioning iJig is used to place the acetabular cup in the position which is intended to maximize anatomical coverage of the cup, with the goal of eliminating the need for intra-operative navigation and also reducing or eliminating surgeon exposure to fluoroscopy. Our novel acetabular reaming system interacts with the acetabular iJigs to ream only to a predetermined depth, thereby reducing inadvertent punctures of the pelvis, in a reduced number of procedural steps. 
•For the hospital, ambulatory surgical center or other medical facility.  Our hip and knee replacement joint products are delivered directly to the surgery center in a single, sterile, patient-labeled kit, eliminating the need for surgery centers to stock excess inventory for each surgical procedure. Unlike off-the-shelf systems for both knee and hip, our systems require little to no re-useable instrumentation due to the use of 3D printed iJigs as well as 3D printed intra-operative sizing trials. This eliminates or reduces the quantity of re-useable instruments and trays that must be processed through the facility to support each surgical procedure, which is especially important for ambulatory surgical centers, and reduces per case cost and also the potential risk for infection. Operating room set up time is also reduced due to the limited number of instruments needed which supports the ability to complete more surgical cases in a given day. We believe that our personalized joint replacement implants and iFit technology platform provide a better economic outcome for hospitals or other medical facilities by:
•improving patient recovery times, reducing blood loss and reducing adverse event rates;
•reducing the costs associated with managing and sterilizing large numbers of reusable instruments; and
•improving turnaround times with the potential for more procedures to be completed within the same amount of time and for the hospital or other medical facility to generate additional revenue.
•For the payor. We believe that our individualized approach offers better clinical outcomes when compared to off-the-shelf implants which leads to faster patient recoveries and lower costs for payors.

Industry background
Market opportunity
Joint replacement for treatment of osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is the principal condition that leads to joint replacement surgery. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of the cartilage that protects and cushions key joints in the body, including the knees, hips and shoulders. This causes the bones in the affected joint to rub against each other, which can result in significant and chronic joint pain, stiffness, swelling, numbness, loss of flexibility and loss of motor function. The pain of osteoarthritis, even during the early stages of the disease, can be overwhelming for patients and can have significant physical, psychological, quality of life and financial implications.
An estimated 32.5 million people in the United States and 500 million people worldwide suffer from osteoarthritis. Compelling demographic trends, such as the growing population of aging yet active individuals and rising rates of obesity, are expected to be key drivers in the continued growth of osteoarthritis occurrence. The National Institutes of Health, or NIH, projects that by 2030, approximately 70 million people in the United States will be 65 years or older and will be at high risk of developing osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is more common in adults over the age of 50, but the condition and precursors of the condition can be observed much earlier. For moderate to advanced cases of osteoarthritis, a surgical procedure may be required to replace the damaged joint. During this joint replacement, or arthroplasty, procedure, a surgeon removes the damaged bone in the affected joint and inserts an implant as a replacement. The joint implant may replace all of the principal components of the joint, in which case the procedure is referred to as a total joint replacement, or may replace only a portion of the joint, in which case the procedure is referred to as a partial joint replacement.
Joint replacement market 
According to the Orthopaedic Industry Annual Report for the 2019 calendar year, which was published in May 2020 by Orthoworld Inc., or the 2019 Orthoworld Report, worldwide sales of joint replacement products, including replacements for knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, ankles and digits outside of trauma, exceeded $19.5 billion in 2019 and are expected to grow to approximately $20.5 billion by the end of 2022.
The 2019 Orthoworld Report estimated that worldwide sales of knee replacement products totaled approximately $9.3 billion and, according to SmartTRAK, the United States represented approximately 59% of total estimated worldwide sales of such products. 
In 2019, according to the 2019 Orthoworld Report, worldwide sales of hip replacement products totaled approximately $7.8 billion. According to SmartTRAK, the United States represented approximately 52% of the total estimated worldwide hip replacement sales. SmartTRAK estimates that primary total hip replacement implants accounted for approximately 66% of revenue of the 2019 hip replacement market in the United States. 
The market for joint replacements extends beyond knee and hip replacements. For example, the treatment of osteoarthritis in the extremities, including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle and digits, may involve the replacement of the affected joint. According to the 2019 Orthoworld Report, the worldwide extremities joint replacement market was estimated at $2.4 billion in 2019.
The Conformis solution
No two joints are the same; accordingly, we believe no two implants should be the same. We believe our personalized joint replacement products, personalized planning services and proprietary technology create an opportunity to disrupt the large, existing market for off-the-shelf orthopedic implants. We use our proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to design and manufacture personalized knee implants that are precisely sized and shaped to fit the unique three-dimensional curvatures of each patient's knee, as well as associated personalized, single-use patient-specific instrumentation, which we refer to as iJigs. We believe our proprietary iFit technology platform is applicable to all major joints.
iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform
Our iFit technology platform comprises three key elements:
•iFit Design, our proprietary algorithms, computer software and design services that we use to design personalized implants and their associated individualized iJigs based on a CT scan of the patient and to prepare a surgical plan personalized for the patient that we call iView.
•iFit Printing, a 3D printing technology that we use to manufacture iJigs and may extend to manufacture certain components of our personalized replacement implants.
•iFit Just-in-Time Delivery our just-in-time manufacturing and delivery capabilities. We manufacture the personalized replacement implants and iJigs to order and do not maintain significant inventory of finished products. We deliver the personalized replacement implants and iJigs to the hospital or other medical facility in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure.
We believe our iFit technology platform enables a scalable business model that greatly lowers our inventory requirements, reduces the amount of working capital required to support our operations and allows us to launch new products and product improvements more rapidly, as compared to manufacturers of off-the-shelf implants
Key benefits of our personalized products and services
We use our iFit technology platform to develop personalized joint replacement systems and single-use surgical instruments. Based on clinical data developed independently by orthopedic surgeons comparing our iTotal CR to off-the-shelf total knee replacement implants, as well as our own research and the common approach we employ in the design and manufacture of all of our products, we believe that our personalized joint replacement implants offer significant benefits to patients, surgeons and hospitals or other medical facilities that are not afforded by standard, or "off-the-shelf," implants.
•For the patient. We believe that our individualized approach offers better clinical outcomes when compared to off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures:
•Better fit.  Using our proprietary algorithms and computer software, we design our personalized knee and hip implants to restore the patient's own native anatomy. As a result, we believe that our implants fit better and regain better function, which is important to minimize pain and maintain the integrity of the implant.
•Faster recovery.  We believe an individual fit requires less bone and soft tissue removal by the surgeon, resulting in less bleeding and swelling within the knee and shortened recovery times.
•Better function.  We design and/or plan our implants to match the patient's anatomy to provide a more stable, natural feeling joint. With regard to our personalized knee implant products, we match the patient’s natural "J" curves, corrected for deformities caused by osteoarthritis, preserve the patient's medial and lateral joint lines, and minimize up-and-down rocking and lift-off of the patient's condyles during normal knee movement. 
•Greater patient satisfaction.  We believe that, as a result of our individualized implants fitting and functioning better, patients have greater overall satisfaction with the results of their knee and hip replacements.
•Earlier intervention.  We believe that patients who undergo knee and hip replacement with one of our products typically retain more of their bone during the surgical procedure, as compared to patients who undergo knee or hip replacement using an off-the-shelf implant. The more bone that is preserved, the more likely the patient will have sufficient bone available if a revision surgery is necessary. As a result, patients may undergo knee or hip replacement surgery at an earlier age.
•For the surgeon.  We believe that our iFit technology platform offers an improved surgical procedure and greater efficiencies for surgeons when compared to knee and hip replacements with off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures:
•Improved surgical procedure.  We believe that the combination of the use of our iJigs with our personalized surgical plan and personalized knee and hip implants enables a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of steps and increasing the precision of implant alignment. In our knee replacement procedure, the surgeon received our individualized pre-operative surgical plan or iView, that indicates where the surgeon makes a predetermined number of cuts that are specifically tailored to each patient and designed to result in a precise fit without the need for repetitive cutting of bone or soft tissue. In our hip replacement procedure, the surgeon receives our individualized pre-operative surgical plan, or Hip iView, that provides anatomical information in advance of surgery that is not available today through the use of standard templating tools. In addition, surgeons have input into our hip system designs within a defined range of parameters to allow surgeons to optimize the Conformis Hip System for each patient, including allowing for leg length correction. Our novel acetabular reaming system interacts with the acetabular iJigs to ream only to a predetermined depth, thereby reducing inadvertent punctures of the pelvis, in a reduced number of procedural steps. An acetabular positioning iJig is used to place the acetabular cup in the position which is intended to optimize anteversion, inclination and anatomical bone coverage of the cup, which we believe will eliminate the need for intra-operative navigation, and also the use of fluoroscopy during the procedure, reducing radiation exposure for both the patient and the surgical staff. 
•Bone preservation.  We believe our knee implants result in the preservation of more bone for several reasons:
•We use our iFit technology platform to design each of the bone cuts required to fit our personalized implants so as to minimize bone resection and maximize bone preservation for the individual patient.
•Our femoral component is fitted using six cuts of the femur as compared to the five cuts typically used with off-the-shelf implants. We reviewed an abstract presented at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Orthopedic Research Society, which studied stress and fatigue in a six-cut femoral implant model that was thinner than a five-cut model by an average of two millimeters. The six-cut implant model displayed substantially lower maximum stress than a five-cut model at a known high-stress location. At the time of the study, two of the authors of this study were our employees, and two of the authors of this study were paid consultants to us. Based in part on this data, we believe our six-cut implants can be thinner than off-the-shelf implants without sacrificing implant strength. We believe a thinner implant requires the surgeon to remove less bone during implantation.
•Our summary of a peer reviewed study of 169 implants published in Reconstructive Review in 2016 indicates that our iTotal CR showed statistically significant less bone loss resection (p≤0.05) when compared to off-the-shelf implants. At the time of the study, two of the authors of this study were our employees, and one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us.
As a result, we believe our implants may appeal particularly to surgeons who treat young, active patients. The surgeons might otherwise recommend postponing surgery out of fear that the patient will not be eligible for a revision surgery if one becomes necessary.
•Fewer post-operative issues.  We believe our personalized knee implants reduce the number of post-operative issues. Our review of a retrospective study of 248 patients who had undergone a total knee replacement, published in the peer-reviewed journal Arthroplasty Today in 2017, or the 2017 AT Study, indicates that patients who received an iTotal CR had significantly lower transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) and at 90 days post-discharge (p=0.023) than patients who received an off-the-shelf total knee replacement implant. We provided financial support for this study. At the time of this study, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us.
•Greater efficiency.  Because of the simplified surgical procedure used with our products, we believe total operating room time is reduced when implanting our knee or hip system as compared to off-the-shelf implants. Our summary of the results of a retrospective study of 70 patients who had undergone total knee replacement presented at the 2015 ICJR World Arthroplasty Congress indicates that average overall operating room time was statistically significantly reduced (p=0.028) for the group of patients who received an iTotal CR in comparison with patients who received an off-the-shelf knee replacement. We believe surgeons can use these time savings to increase their productivity. We also believe the Conformis Hip System will provide reduced operating times as compared to off-the-shelf implants based on both the implant sizing provided to the surgeon in the Hip iView as well as our novel reaming system. 
•For the hospital, ambulatory surgical center or other medical facility.  We believe that our personalized implants and iFit technology platform provide a better economic outcome for hospitals or other medical facilities through:
▪Improved implant and instrument management and reduced sterilization costs.  As a result of our just-in-time delivery model, we ship our knee and hip implants and iJigs to the hospital or other medical facility in advance of the procedure, reducing the need to store implants and instruments in the hospital or other medical facility. Our hip and knee replacement joint products are delivered directly to the surgery center in a single, sterile, patient-labeled kit, eliminating the need for surgery centers to stock excess inventory for each surgical procedure. Unlike off-the-shelf systems for both knee and hip, our systems require little to no re-useable instrumentation due to the use of 3D printed iJigs as well as 3D printed intra-operative sizing trials. We estimate that a total knee replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant requires approximately 6 to 8 double-tiered instrument trays and a hip replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant requires approximately 5 to 7 double-tiered instrument trays, which must be cleaned, sterilized and stored between procedures at significant cost to the hospital or other medical facility. A knee replacement procedure using our iTotal CR product requires only one tray of reusable instruments and a hip replacement procedure using our Conformis Hip System uses only 2 trays of reusable instruments. As a result of our just-in-time delivery approach and the reduction in the requirements for reusable instruments in procedures using our products compared to off-the-shelf implants, we believe our products meaningfully reduce a hospital's or other medical facility’s instrument cleaning, sterilizing and storage costs.
•Improved productivity in the OR.  We believe that the iJigs we provide with our implants eliminate many of the intraoperative sizing steps and reduce the number of positioning steps necessary with off-the-shelf products. In addition, our approach of delivering a single-package with pre-sterilized, single-use instruments allows for a more streamlined and efficient operating room through quick and easy set up and tear down. As a result, we believe that knee and hip replacements with our personalized knee and hip implants can improve turnaround times with the potential for more procedures to be completed within the same amount of time and for hospitals or other medical facilities to generate additional revenue.
•Shorter stays.  We believe that our personalized total joint replacements may shorten hospital or other medical facility stays. Our summary of the results of the 2017 AT Study indicates that a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients who underwent total knee replacement were discharged in fewer than three days following surgery (p=0.037) in the iTotal CR group (42%) than in the off-the-shelf group (30%). Our summary of a study published in Reconstructive Review in 2019, of 62 patients with either our iTotal CR or an off-the-shelf implant in a “Fast Track” protocol, also indicates that a significantly higher (p≤0.05) proportion of iTotal CR patients (66%) were discharged in less than 1 day when compared to off-the-shelf patients (30%).
•Economic Savings. We believe that our technology offers the potential of significant economic savings to hospitals or other medical facilities and payors. For example, the 2017 AT Study compared adverse events rates and cost of care for total knee arthroplasty patients treated with either personalized individually made implants or off-the-shelf implants. In that study, the total average real hospital costs between the personalized implant and off-the-shelf groups were nearly identical (customized implant $16,192 vs OTS $16,240), suggesting that patients with customized implants received improved hospital outcomes at no additional cost to the hospital. However, risk-adjusted per patient total cost of care showed a net savings of $914 per patient for the customized implant group for bundle of care, including the preoperative computed tomography scan, total knee arthroplasty hospitalization, and discharge disposition. Follow-up care costs demonstrated a savings of $1,313 per patient. Additionally, a retrospective study that we funded reviewed over 4,000 Medicare patients who had undergone total knee replacement, was published in the peer-reviewed journal Orthopaedic Proceedings in October 2018, indicated that the cost of care over a 12-month total episode of care was, on average, $1,697 lower for patients who received our personalized implants compared to patients who received off-the-shelf total knee implants. 
•Fewer adverse events.  Many insurers and third-party payors, including Medicare, require the hospital or other medical facility to bear the cost of treating infections and post-operative adverse events if they occur within 90 days following the implant procedure. If reusable instruments are not properly prepared prior to surgery, they are a potential source of costly infections. The lower number of reusable instruments used with our knee and hip implants reduces the possibility of contaminated instruments. Our summary of the results of the 2017 AT Study indicates that use of our iTotal CR statistically significantly reduced blood transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) as compared to an off-the-shelf knee implant. Our review of this published research, sponsored by us, also indicates that use of our iTotal CR is associated with lower adverse event rates during the 90-day period following surgery (p=0.023). The reduction in adverse events observed during the 90-day period following surgery is meaningful because hospitals or other medical facilities may not be reimbursed for additional post-operative follow-up care during this period.
Our strategy
Our objective is for our personalized implants to become the standard of care for orthopedic joint replacement surgery. We believe that our iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform will enable us to offer a wide variety of personalized joint replacement implants with superior performance that offer key clinical and economic benefits over off-the-shelf implants. Key elements of our strategy to achieve our objective are to:
•Expand our sales efforts to drive adoption of our products.  We systematically analyze market opportunities by considering factors such as the number of orthopedic surgeons, procedure volumes, pricing and reimbursement. We often seek to penetrate these markets by establishing relationships with influential surgeons who perform a high-volume of joint replacement procedures. We work with these surgeons to educate other surgeons.
•Leverage the clinical and economic benefits of our products and technologies.  We believe our personalized implant products offer important clinical and economic benefits to patients, surgeons and hospitals or other medical facilities. Potential benefits include better function, less bone resection, less blood loss, greater patient satisfaction, reduced length of stay and lower adverse event rates. These potential economic benefits for hospitals or other medical facilities also include reduced procedure times and reduced instrument management, cleaning and sterilization costs. We believe that our iFit technology platform will allow us to offer products for other joints that also afford important clinical and economic benefits. We have designed and sponsored studies that support these clinical and economic data. We will continue to establish these potential benefits through the design and sponsoring of studies to increase our available clinical and economic data.
•Seek to obtain enhanced reimbursement or create alternative payment models to enhance patient access and information. We believe that today’s reimbursement system does not easily allow for patients to realize the value of our technology. Currently, hospitals and other medical facilities purchase implants for use in joint replacement. Because hospitals are typically paid a global fee that includes implant acquisition costs, we do not believe that hospitals' interests are completely aligned with patient interests. Hospitals, for example, are incentivized to obtain the lowest cost joint replacement system to maximize profits while 
patients may place greater weight on performance and other factors. While many hospitals may rely on surgeon recommendations regarding implant purchase decisions, the increasing trend toward hospital-employee physicians and gainsharing has created a disincentive for physicians to provide full information to patients about their decision-making process relating to, and evaluation of, various surgical options, including the price-versus-performance value tradeoff between various replacement systems. To address these trends, we support clinical studies to demonstrate the overall value of our implants to the healthcare system, which could become increasingly important in bundled care settings. We also educate surgeons, hospitals and third-party payors on our existing clinical and economic benefits. And we actively reach out to private insurers to discuss both their reimbursement policies and how we can collaborate on alternate payment models. Additionally, we provide patient-focused educational and marketing materials to better provide patients, in collaboration with their surgeons, the tools to make more informed decisions about the choices of joint replacement systems available to them.
•Broaden our product portfolio by launching additional personalized orthopedic implants and complementary non-individualized or standard implants.  While our initial focus has been on the knee implant market, we believe our iFit technology platform is applicable to personalized implants for all major joints in the body and multiple implant subcategories within each joint. In 2017, we received clearance from the FDA for the Conformis Hip System, our first personalized hip replacement implant, which we launched on a limited basis in the second half of 2018. In November 2019, we received FDA clearance for and entered full commercial launch of the Conformis Hip System. We are planning for a limited commercial launch of a second stem for the Conformis Hip System in the second half of 2022. We launched on a limited basis our next generation iTotal CR Identity knee replacement implant in the second half of 2019 and are planning a full commercial launch for both the iTotal CR and PS Identity knee replacement implants in the second half of 2021. We have put the development of the next generation of our iUni partial knee replacement system on hold in order to focus on an iTotal cementless option for our iTotal knee implant. We are planning for a limited commercial launch of our cementless or Press Fit option for our iTotal Identity knee implant beginning during the fourth quarter of 2021 and/or first quarter of 2022, with the full commercial launch planned by the second half of 2022. In the second half of 2021, we plan to launch a new standard knee offering, which is being designed to provide a lower-cost alternative to hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, and ASCs, while still taking full advantage of years of patient data collected through Conformis’ unique business model. We also expect a limited commercial launch of our full system Identity knee replacement implants in the second half of 2021. We also may seek to apply our iFit technology platform to develop additional product opportunities in the knee and hip replacement markets and other orthopedic markets in the longer-term, including shoulder, other extremities and spine.
•Optimize our just-in-time manufacturing processes.  We have built state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, including proprietary software and 3D printing capabilities. We are continuing to invest in these processes, as we believe they provide us important competitive advantages, including:
•expansion of gross margin through various initiatives, including the ongoing vertical integration of some of our manufacturing processes and/or off-shoring of appropriate processes;
•shorter product design and development time frames; and
•continuous improvement of our products without the difficulty faced by our competitors of making obsolete a large inventory of off-the-shelf implants and instruments.
•Enhance our patent portfolio and continue to exploit our patent position.  As of January 31, 2021, we own or exclusively in-license a total of approximately 349 issued patents and pending patent applications that cover personalized implants and PSI for all major joints and other elements of our iFit technology platform. See "Note H—Commitments and Contingencies" in the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our patent litigation.
Our products
Knee replacement products
We offer a broad line of primary knee replacement implants, both partial and total, that we personalize through proprietary software and services to fit the individual patients. Surgeons use our family of personalized knee implants to treat mild to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. All of our knee replacement products and related design software have been cleared by the FDA under the premarket notification process of Section 510(k) of the FDCA. We also have received CE Mark certification for Europe and applicable geographies. We deliver our personalized knee 
replacement implants and iJigs, together with iView, to the hospital or other medical facility in a single pre-sterilized package in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure.
The following is an overview of each of our knee replacement implant products:

iTotal CR is the only cruciate-retaining, personalized total knee replacement system on the market designed to restore the natural shape of a patient's knee. We introduced the iTotal CR in 2011 and launched new generations in each of 2012, 2013 and 2015. The iTotal CR includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray, and dual medial and lateral polyethylene tibia tray inserts, which serve as a cushion between the femoral and tibial components, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our personalized components.
The iTotal PS is the only posterior cruciate ligament substituting, or posterior-stabilized, personalized total knee replacement product on the market designed to restore the natural shape of a patient's knee. We introduced the iTotal PS in 2015. The iTotal PS includes a femoral implant with a metal cam, a tibial tray, and a single polyethylene tibia tray insert, which includes a plastic spine, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our personalized components. 
The iDuo is the only personalized bicompartmental knee replacement system on the market. The iDuo is considered a bicruciate-retaining knee replacement because the surgeon may retain both the anterior cruciate ligaments, or ACL, and posterior cruciate ligaments, or PCL. We introduced the iDuo in 2007 and launched a second generation in 2010. The iDuo includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray and a single polyethylene tibia tray insert, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our personalized components. 
The iUni is a personalized unicompartmental knee replacement product for treatment of the medial or lateral compartment of the knee. The iUni is considered a bicruciate-retaining knee replacement because the surgeon retains both the ACL and PCL. We introduced the iUni in 2007 and launched a second generation in 2009. The iUni includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray and a single polyethylene tibia tray insert, all of which are individually made for the particular patient. 


Building off the legacy of the iTotal platform the iTotal® Identity is Conformis’ newest patient-specific knee system. The customized femur and new titanium tibial implant are designed to fit specific anatomy to reduce sizing compromises and allow for optimal bone preservation. The knee system is delivered in a single, pre-sterilized kit with surgeon selected polyethylene inserts. Identity incorporates new design features such as tibial stem extensions, and refined patient-specific instrumentation (PSI), to provide a more traditional bone-cutting experience.

Hip replacement products
Conformis Hip System
As with the knee, no two hips are the same. They vary in size and shape. As is the case for knee replacements, off-the-shelf hip replacement implants are offered in a limited number of standard shapes and sizes. Also, off-the-shelf hip implants require a large number of reusable instrument trays and the same instrument management challenges and costs of cleaning and sterilization associated with off-the-shelf knee implants. In addition, orthopedic surgery using off-the-shelf hip implants is characterized by a difficult surgical technique and can suffer from a lack of reproducibility in component placement. 
On November 6, 2019, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our full commercial release of the Conformis Hip System product, and we market-launched the system on November 11, 2019. Similar to the design process we use for our knee implant products, we use proprietary software, to design and manufacture our Conformis Hip System implants and iJigs. After each patient’s CT scan is converted into a 3-dimensional computer model, the unique measurements of each patient’s anatomy are transformed into a comprehensive, individualized, pre-operative surgical plan, or Hip iView, that is delivered to the surgeon in advance of the operation. The Hip iView provides anatomical information to the surgeon that is not available today through the use of standard templating tools. Surgeons have input during the planning process within a defined range of parameters to allow them to optimize the Conformis Hip System for each patient, including allowing for leg length and offset correction. Our Conformis Hip System provides a femoral stem with a patient-specific neck and the planned sizes for the acetabular cup, liner and head. Combined with the Hip iView, our Conformis Hip System allows for improved operating room efficiency and decreased inventory needs of the facility. In addition, our Conformis Hip System includes a novel acetabular reaming system that interacts with the acetabular iJigs to ream only to a predetermined depth in a reduced number of procedural steps. Our Conformis Hip System further includes an acetabular positioning iJig that is used to place the acetabular cup in the position which is intended to optimize anteversion, inclination and anatomical coverage of the cup, with the goal of eliminating the need for intra-operative navigation, reducing surgeon, staff and patient exposure to fluoroscopy. 
We believe the introduction of the Conformis Hip System will provide synergies with our existing line of personalized knee implants because most surgeons who perform knee replacements also perform hip replacements and knee and hip replacement implants are sold through the same distribution channels. We also believe our surgical plan and improved surgical technique for hip arthroplasty will attract surgeons who are not current customers. Thus, we believe that the Conformis Hip System complements our existing product line and will allow us to expand our customer base, sales force and distribution channels.
    The following is an overview of our Conformis Hip System:

Conformis Hip System 
The Conformis Hip System, introduced in July 2018, is the only primary total hip replacement system on the market designed with 3D imaging technology to provide a stem and acetabular cup size that matches each patient’s specific anatomy. The implant system includes a single-piece stem with patient-specific neck, acetabular cup, iPoly XE® (highly crosslinked vitamin-e infused UHMWPE) polyethylene liner, and a choice of ceramic or cobalt chrome femoral head. 3D imaging technology is also used to create a pre-surgical plan, which accompanies a set of disposable patient-specific 3D printed jigs, to aid in implant positioning. 

Cordera Hip System
In addition to the patient-specific Hip System, we received FDA 510(k) clearance on August 28, 2019 for an off-the-shelf Cordera Hip System, and FDA 510(k) clearance on September 24, 2020 for an expansion to the Cordera™ Hip System which may incorporate a personalized surgical plan and patient specific instruments. The Cordera Hip System, is an uncemented, primary total hip replacement composed of femoral and acetabular components. The stems are offered in the same sizes as the patient-specific system and come in two standard neck angles and two standard neck lengths. Combined with our existing head and acetabular cup line, we can offer a standard off-the-shelf system, with or without surgical pre-planning and without the wait for personalization. The Cordera Hip System similar to standard off-the-shelf systems, does not offer personalized neck lengths, neck angles or versions. In December 2020, we commenced the U.S. commercial launch of the new Cordera™ Match Hip System, one of multiple planned product extensions featuring the Cordera™ Hip System. The Cordera™ Match Hip System is implanted utilizing a surgeon-approved, personalized iView and patient-specific iJigs. 
Our proprietary iJigs
Our iJigs are personalized, single-use, patient-specific instrumentation. The iJigs we deliver with our joint replacement products include the guides and instruments the surgeon requires to remove the bone and soft tissue necessary to fit our personalized implant to the patient. We believe that providing our iJigs with our personalized implants enables a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of steps and increasing the precision of the alignment.
In an off-the-shelf procedure, the surgeon must have large numbers of reusable instruments available because the surgeon does not know in advance which bone cuts and other tissue removal will be necessary to prepare the patient to receive the off-the-shelf implant. A knee replacement procedure performed using our personalized implants and iJigs requires only one tray of reusable instruments, which we provide to the hospital or other medical facility, as compared to a knee replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant, which requires approximately 6 to 8 double-tiered, reusable instrument trays, which the off-the-shelf manufacturer provides to the hospital or other medical facility. A hip replacement procedure performed using our personalized implants and iJigs requires only 2 trays of reusable instruments, which we provide to the hospital or other medical facility, as compared to a hip replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant, which requires approximately 5 to 7 double-tiered, reusable instrument trays, which the off-the-shelf manufacturer provides to the hospital or other medical facility. We provide our implants with a full set of iJigs in a single package. Our iJigs arrive sterile and are discarded after use.
Clinical studies
In evaluating the clinical and economic benefits of our personalized knee implants, we consider results obtained from studies sponsored by us, conducted by orthopedic surgeons who are paid consultants to us and 
conducted independently by orthopedic surgeons, including studies that compare our personalized knee implants with off-the-shelf knee implants. As of January 31, 2021, there have been more than 30 peer-reviewed journal articles and numerous abstracts either presented or accepted for presentation at conferences reporting on the results of clinical studies of our personalized knee implants. Of the published or presented studies known to us that compared our knee replacement product to an off-the-shelf product, most reported either that the performance of our knee replacement product was superior to an off-the-shelf product on the reported measures or that there were no statistically significant differences detected between the performance of our knee replacement product and an off-the-shelf knee replacement product on those measures.
Sales and marketing
We market and sell our products in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Dutch Antilles, Suriname, Australia, Argentina, the United Arab Emirates, the Sultanate of Oman, Italy, San Marino, Poland and other markets. We expect that our international activities will increase over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in additional international markets. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated results of operations—Product revenue" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of product revenue by geography. We market our products to orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities, including ambulatory surgery centers, and patients. We expect to expand the size of our sales and marketing capabilities by entering into additional independent sales and distributor representative arrangements in key territories.
We offer technical and product focused training programs for our direct sales, independent sales and distributor representatives. We have designed these programs to provide the entire sales force with technical expertise and product knowledge so they may more effectively represent and market our products to surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities. We believe we offer a simplified surgical technique with the use of our products that may reduce the need for our sales representatives to spend time in the operating room during a procedure when compared to the sales representatives of off-the-shelf implant manufacturers. This potentially will allow our sales representatives to spend more time on new customer growth opportunities.
We believe surgeons appreciate the clinical and economic benefits, including increased patient satisfaction, operating room efficiencies and lower adverse event rates, that we believe our products offer. In addition, we believe surgeons will appreciate the additional patient information and improved surgical efficiencies provided by our Conformis Hip System. We believe hospitals and other medical facilities, including ambulatory surgical centers, focus on the economic benefits that we believe are associated with our products, such as fewer instrument trays to manage, clean and sterilize, reduced operating room time, faster operating room set up and breakdown time and lower adverse event rates. We believe patients are interested in returning to daily activities quickly and are attracted to our personalized approach. We employ direct-to-consumer marketing, primarily through patient testimonials, social media, search engine marketing, and print, online, radio and television news reports.
In the United States, we use a database of surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities and procedure volumes to determine which geographical regions are most commercially attractive. Globally, we look for markets with a high volume of total knee replacements, favorable reimbursement characteristics and an historical openness to advanced technologies.
As part of our targeted regional commercial strategy, we identify markets in the United States based on knee replacement procedure volume, surgeon density, prevailing average selling price for a knee replacement, and other factors. We work to significantly increase our sales in these markets by focusing on high-volume, influential surgeons who use our products. We create a tailored direct marketing strategy to increase consumer awareness in these markets. We intend to use the same commercial strategy for the Conformis Hip System.
Research and development
Our internal research and development efforts are focused on continued innovation to develop personalized implants for the knee and hip and to assess the application of our iFit technology platform to other major joints.
In our research and development activities, we actively work on:
•new products and services development;
•enhancements of existing products and software;
•improvements in our iFit technology platform to further advance production efficiency and decrease the production time from receipt of an order to delivery of our product; and
•advancements of our iFit technology platform that will enable us to provide our personalized products to a larger customer base, which we refer to as mass personalization.
Our team of 40 full-time research and development employees has extensive experience in biomechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering and software engineering and development. A significant portion of our research and development activities involves the development of proprietary algorithms and computer software that underpins our entire iFit technology platform. For the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, company-sponsored research and development expense was $11.9 million, and $12.5 million, respectively.
When we develop a new product or seek to improve our existing products, our team of biomechanical, process and software engineers typically collaborates closely with experienced orthopedic surgeons and other independent scientists. After we complete the development of a new product or an improvement to an existing product, we seek regulatory clearance before selling the product.
Manufacturing
We conduct our manufacturing activities in state-of-the-art design and manufacturing facilities in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Wallingford, Connecticut and Hyderabad, India.
Our design services include the production of unique, individualized, computer-aided designs (“CAD” or “CAD designs”) on a per-patient basis either in-house and/or through a third party in India. We use the result of these design services to direct a majority of our product manufacturing efforts. As part of our manufacturing cost reduction efforts we have implemented, in 2017 and 2018, we continued transitioning our in-house CAD labor force to the third party in India and, in 2018, we significantly reduced our in-house CAD labor force. We manufacture all of our patient-specific instruments, or iJigs, tibial trays used in our total knee implants, polyethylene tibia tray inserts for our total knee implants, at our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. In 2017, we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Broad Peak Manufacturing, LLC or BPM in Wallingford, Connecticut. Our femoral implant components are polished and passivated at our facility in Wallingford, Connecticut. We outsource the production of the femoral and other implant components to third-party suppliers. Our suppliers make our personalized implant components using the CAD designs we supply.
We have established an approved supplier base that is skilled in medical device manufacturing. Our suppliers are primarily based in the United States. We do not have any long-term supply arrangements and purchase our supplies on a purchase order basis. For certain raw materials, including the polymer powder used for 3D printing our iJigs and the polyethylene block used for CNC machining of our tibia tray inserts, we rely on sole source providers who service large portions of the markets for these materials.
In the future, if and as the volume of our product sales increases, we expect to take the following steps in connection with our manufacturing activities:
•continue to increase the production of certain components of our products that we manufacture in-house, which we believe we can manufacture at a lower unit cost than vendors we currently use;
•develop new versions of our software used in the design of our personalized joint replacement implants, which we believe will reduce costs associated with the design process; and
•obtain more favorable pricing of certain components of our products manufactured for us by third parties.
We also plan to explore other opportunities to reduce our manufacturing costs.
iFit 3D printing
We believe that 3D printing is especially suited for production of our patient-specific instruments. We focus on 3D printing as a key element of our manufacturing because we believe it enables fast, cost-effective, and scalable processes that will deliver high quality patient-specific instruments. As a result, 3D printing plays a key role in our manufacturing operations.
We apply our iFit 3D printing technology to manufacture iJigs using computer-controlled lasers that melt polymer powders into a solid on a layer-by-layer basis until the entire part is completed. The process of melting powders into a solid is called sintering. We use selective laser sintering, or SLS, with approved polymer powders to manufacture plastic components for our iJigs.
Quality assurance
We apply a variety of automated and manual quality controls to our iJigs, implant components and other instruments we supply to ensure that our products meet specified requirements. Members of our quality department also inspect our devices at various stages during the manufacturing cycle to verify that quality to specifications are met. Our quality department audits our suppliers on a set interval and schedule to ensure compliance to appropriate ISO standards, FDA regulations and to our specifications, policies and procedures for our devices.
We and our suppliers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under its Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The QSR requires manufacturers to establish and follow quality systems consistent with the QSR framework to ensure that their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. In accordance with the QSR framework, we have validated and/or verified the processes used in the manufacturing and testing of our devices. Our Wilmington and Wallingford manufacturing facilities are FDA registered, and we believe they are compliant with the FDA's QSR. We maintain certification by the British Standards Institution (BSI Netherlands), or BSI, a Notified Body, as required by the Medical Device Directives of Europe, to the International Standards Organization Standard 13485 of our quality system. Certification by a Notified Body to ISO 13485 constitutes a presumption of conformity with the related elements of the MDD and, in the future, the MDR, a necessary element of obtaining CE Marking in the EU. As a result of Brexit, BSI has established offices in Netherlands to continue to provide Notified Body CE Mark services for the Industry in Europe. We have moved our registrations to BSI Netherlands Office. We are subject to periodic, announced and unannounced inspections by BSI, the FDA, and other governmental agencies. We continue to monitor our quality system and management efforts in order to maintain our overall level of compliance. See "Regulatory requirements" below.
Intellectual property
Protection of our intellectual property is an important priority for our company. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary rights for our products and technology, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions related to our products and technology where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We typically seek patents on inventions relating to personalized implants and iJigs, and on their methods of manufacture. We generally file patent applications in the United States, the major markets in the EU, and in select other commercially important countries. We typically rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary algorithms that we use to design personalized implants and iJigs.

As of January 31, 2021, we have filed 142 trademark registrations in the United States and in other major markets worldwide, including the following marks: Conformis, iFit, iTotal, iDuo, and iUni. We have 1 trademark application pending worldwide.
Competition
The joint replacement industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. We face competition from many different sources, including major medical device companies.
We compete with several large, well-known companies that dominate the market for orthopedic products, principally Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., or Zimmer Biomet, Stryker Corporation, or Stryker, DePuy Synthes, Inc., or DePuy, a Johnson & Johnson company and Smith & Nephew, Inc., or Smith & Nephew. These competitors have significantly greater financial resources, larger sales forces and networks of distributors, a greater number of established relationships, some of which may be exclusive, with key orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities, third-party payors, and independent sales representatives and distributors, and greater experience in research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory clearances and marketing approved products than we do. These companies also compete with us in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the development of our products and recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, engineering and management personnel.
We also compete with numerous other companies that are developing and marketing competitive joint replacement products, as well as companies exploring alternatives to joint replacement such as biologic cartilage repair systems.
We believe that the principal factors on which we compete with others in our market include:
•the ability to introduce innovative products that are differentiated from competitors' offerings and represent an improvement over currently available products;
•the ease of use of the products and the quality of training, services and clinical support provided to surgeons and hospitals and other medical facilities;
•the safety and efficacy of products and procedures, as demonstrated in published studies and other clinical reports;
•the ability to anticipate and meet customers' needs and commercialize new products in a timely manner;
•acceptance and adoption of products by patients, physicians and hospitals and other medical facilities; and
•the price of products and cost effectiveness of the procedure and availability and rate of third-party reimbursement.
The prices that we charge our hospital customers for our products vary based on such factors as the volume of product being purchased, geographic region, reimbursement environment and competitive factors. We believe that our current pricing for our products generally is within the same range as that of our principal competitors who offer a standard off-the-shelf-implant, with a premium of five percent on average.
Regulatory requirements
Our medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and other authorities in the United States and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Economic Area (EEA). These governmental authorities regulate the introduction of medical devices into their respective geographies within their jurisdiction. The regulations cover the entire life cycle of the product, including the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, labeling, advertising and promotion of the devices. In addition, post-approval monitoring and reporting, as well as import and export of medical devices, are subject to regulatory requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances in the United States, certificates of conformity from Notified Bodies in the EEA, and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review, approval and clearance of medical devices in the United States
Medical devices in the United States are strictly regulated by the FDA. Under the Code of Federal Regulation, 21 CFR Parts 800-1299, Food and Drugs, a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.
Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless it has been cleared by the FDA through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), approval of a de novo application, or approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA and the novelty of the medical device. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes depending on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices have the lowest level or risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirement, although manufacturers of these devices are still subject to registration, listing, labeling and QSR requirements. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
To date, we have used the 510(k) premarket notification process to obtain regulatory clearance from the FDA for the marketing, sale and distribution of our joint replacement products in the United States. All of our currently marketed products are Class II devices marketed pursuant to 510(k) clearances. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
To date, none of our submissions to the FDA have required FDA review under the premarket approval process nor have any of our 510(k)s required the submission of clinical data. However, we have conducted and continue to conduct numerous post-market studies aimed at demonstrating the clinical benefits of our personalized knee replacement systems as compared to off-the-shelf systems.
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of ‘‘off-label’’ uses of cleared or approved products; 
•requirements related to promotional activities; 
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices; 
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
•unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; 
•customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
•refusing or delaying our requests for regulatory approvals or clearances of new products or modified products; 
•withdrawing a PMA that has already been granted; 
•refusal to grant export approval for our products; or 
•criminal prosecution.
Regulation of medical devices in the EEA
The EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC), or the MDD, sets out the basic regulatory framework currently applicable to medical devices in the EEA. In the EEA, our medical devices must comply with the Essential Requirements in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, which we refer to as the Essential Requirements. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark, to our medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements of the MDD and obtain the right to affix the CE mark, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), in relation to which the manufacturer can 
issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a third-party organization designated by a Competent Authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments, which is referred to as a Notified Body. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine products' technical documentation and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This Certificate and the related conformity assessment process entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (1) clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, (2) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or (3) both clinical studies and scientific literature. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These include the requirement of prior authorization by the Competent Authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming.
To date, we have used the CE Marking process to satisfy the conformity standards required to market and sell our joint replacement products in the EU. CE marking of our products currently involves a Notified Body. The Notified Body that has conducted conformity assessments with respect to our joint replacement products is BSI Netherlands.
Even after we receive a CE Certificate of Conformity enabling us to affix the CE Mark on a product and to sell our product in the EEA countries, a Notified Body or a competent authority may require post-marketing studies of our product. Failure to comply with such requirements in a timely manner could result in the withdrawal of our CE Certificate of Conformity and the recall or withdrawal of our product from the market in the EEA, which would prevent us from generating revenue from sales of that product in the EEA. Moreover, each CE Certificate of Conformity is valid for a maximum of five years, but more commonly three years. Our current CE Certificates of Conformity are valid through December 2, 2022 for our iUni product, May 26, 2024 for our iDuo product, and May 26, 2024 for our iTotal PS product. Our iTotal CR product CE Certificate of Conformity expires on May 8, 2021 and we expect to receive a renewal certificate before expiration. At the end of each period of validity we are required to apply to the Notified Body for a renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity. There may be delays in the renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity or the Notified Body may require modifications to our products or to the related technical documentation before it agrees to issue the new CE Certificate of Conformity.
In addition, we must inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our devices that could affect compliance with the Essential Requirements or the devices' intended purpose. The Notified Body will then assess the changes and verify whether they affect the products' conformity with the Essential Requirements or the conditions for the use of the devices. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body will issue a new CE Certificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity attesting compliance with the Essential Requirements. If it is not, we may not be able to continue to market and sell the product in the EEA.
Moreover, in May 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), or MDR was adopted. The EU Medical Devices Regulation repeals and replaces the MDD. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the individual EEA Member States, the Regulation will be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of national implement laws in the individual EEA countries, in all EEA countries and is intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA countries. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR will become applicable on May 26, 2021. Once applicable, the new Regulation will among other things: 
•strengthen the rules on placing devices on the EEA market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
•establish explicit provisions concerning manufacturers’ responsibilities for follow-up to ensure the on-going quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
•improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
•set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EEA; 
•strengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
We and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance with the new MDR face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the European Commission and the Competent Authorities of EEA countries, creating risks in several areas, including the CE Marking process and data transparency, in the upcoming years. Major Quality System updates, including Clinical Evaluation and Post Market Surveillance, are complete and being rolled out within the Company. The technical documentation updates for our first product to require MDR CE Marking are underway. Our EU MDR Quality System audit was accepted by the Notified Body and we are currently awaiting the scheduling date for our Quality System audit, which will include witness tests and reconciliation activities during on-site audits to ensure that the quality management system is working properly. We expect to be compliant with the applicable requirements of the EU MDR by May 2021.
UK and Brexit
The UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The Agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods. The Agreement does not however, specifically address medical devices. The Agreement seeks to ensure that the parties ensure “regulatory cooperation”. Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. In light of the fact that the CE marking process is set out in EU law, which no longer applies in the UK, the UK has devised a new route to market culminating in a UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark to replace the CE mark. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the regulations governing CE marks. As part of the Agreement, the EU and the UK have agreed to continue to recognize declarations of conformity based on a self-assessment in the other territory.
The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued Guidance on Regulating medical devices in the UK. This Guidance provides that the MHRA continue to recognize CE marking in Great Britain until June 30, 2023 and certificates issued by Notified Bodies designated in the EEA will continue to be valid for the Great Britain market until June 30, 2023. From July 1, 2023, manufacturers must obtain the UKCA mark, to place a medical device on the Great Britain market manufacturers must register their devices with the MHRA via the Device Online Registration System, subject to grace periods depending on the device classification. Manufacturers are required to designate an Authorized Representative in the UK and we have designated MDSS as our Authorized Representative in the UK and the EU. A UK designated Notified Body will be also be required for placing our devices on the market in the UK and we have designated BSI UK as our Notified Body in the UK and BSI Netherlands in the EU.
Marketing and sales considerations in the EEA and the UK
In the EEA and the UK, medical devices may be promoted only for the intended purpose for which the devices have been CE Marked. The advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to EEA countries’ national laws implementing the MDD and, in the future, applying the MDR. Moreover, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as national legislation of individual EEA countries governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices also apply. EEA countries’ legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our ability to advertise our products directly to the general public.  In addition, voluntary EEA and national industry Codes of Conduct provide guidelines 
on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Failure to comply with this requirement could lead to the imposition of penalties by the Competent Authorities of EEA countries and the UK. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the medical device, seizure of the promotional materials and fines.
Product vigilance and post-approval monitoring in the EEA and the UK
Additionally, all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EEA and the UK are legally bound to report certain incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the Competent Authority, in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred and to their Notified Body. Under the MDD, an incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.
In the EEA and the UK, manufacturers must comply with vigilance reporting requirements. Incidents must be reported to the relevant Competent Authorities of the EEA countries or the MHRA in the UK. Manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. See "Risk Factors-Risks related to government regulation — If our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions, which could harm our business."
Third-party reimbursement
In the United States and most other major joint implant markets outside the United States, many third-party payors, including government health programs, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, reimburse hospitals and other medical facilities an aggregate amount for all elements of a joint replacement procedure, including operating room time, patient care and the joint replacement product. As a result, our products generally are not reimbursed separately, but instead are subject to the limits imposed by third-party payors on the coverage and reimbursement of procedures that utilize our products.
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such procedures involving the use of our products cleared by the FDA and approved by other government authorities will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States, such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a particular procedure may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the procedure once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to particular procedures on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved procedures involving the use of our products for a particular indication.
In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to limit payments by governmental payors for medical devices, and the procedures in which medical devices are used. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.
In the EEA, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. In many foreign markets, pricing and approval of use of medical devices is subject to governmental control. 
In January 2019, the rate of reimbursement for surgical procedures using our products in Germany was changed. Beginning January 1, 2019, the reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iTotal CR and iTotal PS products increased by approximately 1.6%, while the reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iUni and iDuo products increased by approximately 30% and 11%, respectively. Though this increase in reimbursement is a positive change, especially with regard to our iUni and iDuo products, we continue to experience MDK denials of the higher reimbursement code, which continues to adversely impact our sales in Germany. We are working with our physicians and hospitals and other medical facilities in Germany and experienced consultants to appeal MDK denials and demonstrate to MDK the benefits of our products, including patient satisfaction and recovery rates. In each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, sales in Germany represented 10% of our total product sales. In addition to being affected by changes in reimbursement rates, use of our products for each patient in Germany may also be subject to approval by the Medizinischer Dienst der Krankenkassen (translated: Medical Service of Health Insurance), or MDK. Beginning in 2016, we experienced a significant increase in the number of 
denials by MDK for increased cost associated with the use of our products and, in such instances, the amount of reimbursement to the hospitals and other medical facilities was lowered to that of an off-the-shelf knee. We believe that the change in the rate of reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iTotal CR and iTotal PS products has not materially impacted sales in Germany. The decrease in the rate of reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iUni and iDuo products and the increasing denials by MDK for approval under the higher reimbursement code has adversely impacted our sales in Germany. 
Healthcare laws and regulations
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and selection of medical devices for patients. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
•The federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between device manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and others. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to apply to anything of value including, for example, gifts, cash payments, donations, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service, or compensation for something other than fair market value. Liability under the AKS may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the AKS protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical device products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit within an exception or safe harbor. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational grants and reimbursement support programs. Violations of this law are punishable by up to ten years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
•The federal civil False Claims Act (FCA) imposes liability, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers have faced liability under the FCA for providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS also are deemed false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations (collectively, HIPAA), imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services;
•We may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA - other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits - we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or 
disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA; 
•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Several states have enacted legislation requiring medical device manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual health care providers; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit certain sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to health care providers. 
State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is a regulation in the European Union, or EU, that, among other things, unifies data protection regulation within the EU and governs the export of certain personal data and health information of citizens of the EU. Enforcement of these regulations began May 25, 2018. The FDA has also begun enforcing its Cybersecurity Guidance Document through the review of 510(k) applications to ensure companies are addressing concerns around this issue. Lack of proper documentation on Cybersecurity may delay approval of a 510(k) or withdrawal of a 510(k).
EU Data Protection Legislation
The EU, EEA countries and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became applicable on May 25, 2018 and is directly applicable in each EEA country. It is hoped that the Regulation will result in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EEA. The GDPR imposes strict requirements and onerous accountability obligations on companies that process personal data, especially if they process sensitive personal data (such as data concerning patient health), including significant fines for non-compliance with the GDPR. Implementation of the GDPR has influenced other jurisdictions to either amend, or propose legislation to amend their existing data privacy and cybersecurity laws to resemble the requirements of GDPR. For example, on June 27, 2018, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CaCPA. CaCPA has been characterized as the first “GDPR-like” privacy statute to be enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions in the GDPR. 
Financial information about segments and geographic areas
We operate as one reportable segment as described in "Note B—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The countries in which we have local revenue generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico), Germany, and the rest of the world, which consists of the United Kingdom predominately and several other foreign countries. Sales are attributable to a geographic area based upon the customer’s country of domicile. Net property, plant and equipment are based upon physical location of the assets. Additional financial information about geographic areas is included in "Note L—Segment and Geographic Data" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are exposed to risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures, import or export requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, differing regulatory requirements, government-managed healthcare systems, government-mandated pricing and reimbursement and health technology assessment schemes, government-mandated collection periods, patient privacy laws and regulations, and other data privacy laws and regulations.
Employees
As of January 31, 2021, we had 259 full-time employees, 31 of whom were engaged in sales and marketing, 41 in research and development, 115 in manufacturing and service, 38 in regulatory, clinical affairs and quality activities and 34 in general administrative and accounting activities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values.
We strive to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees. Our efforts begin at the entry level with development, including partnering with two- and four-year colleges and universities. We also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development for every employee, which we believe also drives our retention efforts.
We believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe, respectful, fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business. Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values.
