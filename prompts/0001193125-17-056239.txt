General 
 Waters Corporation (the Company) is an analytical instrument manufacturer that primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC® and together with HPLC, referred to as LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (LC-MS) and sold as integrated instrument systems using a common software platform. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA® product line. The Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Companys instruments, as well as other suppliers instruments, and are typically purchased by customers as part of the instrument system. 
 The Companys products are used by life science, pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications. The Companys LC and LC-MS instruments are utilized in this broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. These instruments are used in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as proteomics), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. The Companys thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. 
 Waters Corporation, organized as a Delaware corporation in 1991, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of Waters Technologies Corporation, its operating subsidiary. Waters Corporation became a publicly-traded company with its initial public offering (IPO) in November 1995. Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited in September 1997. 
 Business Segments 
 The Companys business activities, for which discrete financial information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: Waters® and TA. The Company operates in the analytical instruments industry by designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing instrument systems, columns and other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The Companys two operating segments have similar economic characteristics; product processes; products and services; types and classes of customers; methods of distribution; and regulatory environments. Because of these similarities, the two operating segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes. 
 Information concerning revenues and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Companys products, services and geographic areas is set forth in Note 16 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Waters Products and Markets 
 High Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography 
 HPLC is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLCs performance capabilities enable it to separate, identify and quantify approximately 80% of all known chemicals and materials. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality control and process engineering applications. 
 The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to understand diseases, identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and governmental agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and their foreign counterparts that mandate testing requiring HPLC-based methodologies. 
 In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY UPLC®, to accommodate the increased pressure and narrow chromatographic bands that are generated by these small particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses performed by HPLC. In addition, in using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information. While offering significant performance advantages, the ACQUITY UPLC is also compatible with the Companys software products and the general operating protocols of HPLC. For these reasons, the Companys customers and field sales and support organizations are well positioned to utilize this new technology and instrument. In 2012, the Company introduced UltraPerformance Convergence Chromatography® (UPC2®) with the release of the ACQUITY® UPC2®  system. This new technology marries the unrealized potential of supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) with the proven UPLC technology, using carbon dioxide as the primary mobile phase. By varying mobile phase strength, pressure, temperature and stationary phase with UPC2, a user can separate, detect and quantify structural analogs, isomers, enantiomeric and diasteriomeric mixtures  all compounds or samples that challenge todays laboratories. In 2014, the Company introduced the ACQUITY UPLC® M-Class instrument system. This system delivers the sensitivity to quantify and identify vanishingly small concentrations of key molecules, particularly when used with advanced mass spectrometric characterization. The innovations incorporated into the ACQUITY UPLC M-Class system are led by its internal low-volume design and newly redesigned fluidics that minimize dispersive and adsorptive losses during a chromatographic separation. In 2015, the Company introduced the ACQUITY® Arc System and its enabling Arc Multi-flow pathTM technology, which bridges the gap between HPLC and UPLC by emulating a variety of HPLC systems without altering the methods gradient table and enabling improved chromatographic performance of methods by leveraging 2.5-2.7 micron particle column technologies. 
 Waters manufactures LC instruments that are offered in configurations that allow for varying degrees of automation, from component configured systems for academic teaching and research applications to fully automated systems for regulated testing, and that have a variety of detection technologies, from ultra-violet (UV) absorbance to MS, optimized for certain analyses. The Company also manufactures tailored LC systems for the analysis of biologics, as well as an LC detector utilizing evaporative light scattering technology to expand the usage of LC to compounds that are not amenable to UV absorbance detection. 
 The primary consumable products for LC are chromatography columns. These columns are packed with separation media used in the LC testing process and are typically replaced at regular intervals. The 
 
2 
 
 chromatography column contains one of several types of packing material, typically stationary phase particles made from silica or polymeric resins. As the sample permeates through the column, it is separated into its constituent components. 
 Waters HPLC columns can be used on Waters-branded and competitors LC systems. The Company believes that it is one of a few suppliers in the world that processes silica and polymeric resins, packs columns and distributes its own products. In doing so, the Company believes it can better ensure product consistency, a key attribute for its customers in quality control laboratories, and can react quickly to new customer requirements. The Company believes that its ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns are used primarily on its ACQUITY UPLC instrument systems and, furthermore, that its ACQUITY UPLC instruments primarily use ACQUITY UPLC columns. In 2014, the Company expanded its CORTECS® family with a new line of 2.7 micron silica-based, solid-core particle columns for usage on UPLC, as well as HPLC systems. In addition, the Company introduced size exclusion chromatography columns for the characterization of proteins and ACQUITY UPC2 columns for chiral and achiral separations. In 2015, the Company introduced the Oasis® PRiME HLB cartridges, which process samples up to 40% faster and deliver samples that are up to 70% cleaner with fewer LC-MS matrix effects than samples prepared using other extraction techniques. In addition, the ACQUITY UPLC® Glycoprotein BEH Amide columns were introduced in 2015 to help biopharmaceutical companies to better understand where glycan groups (bonded sugars) are located within the therapeutic proteins they are developing and manufacturing. In 2016, the Company continued to expand its column chemistry capabilities through the introduction of CORTECS® C8, CORTECS® Phenyl, CORTECS® T3 and CORTECS® Shield RP18. In addition, the Company expanded its TorusTM SFC column line through the introduction of four new preparative SFC columns, which are typically larger diameter columns designed for purification laboratories investigating drug compounds, natural products or synthetic chemicals. 
 The Companys chemistry consumable products also include environmental and nutritional safety testing products, including Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) and Proficiency Testing (PT) products. Laboratories around the world and across multiple industries use these products for quality control and proficiency testing and also purchase product support services required to help with their federal and state mandated accreditation requirements or with quality control over critical pharmaceutical analysis. For example, the Company provides tests to identify and quantify mycotoxins (fungal biological contaminants) in various agricultural commodities. These test kits provide reliable, quantitative detection of particular mycotoxins through the choice of fluorimetry, HPLC or LC-MS. In 2014, the Company introduced the Afla-V® AQUA test strips for detecting aflatoxins in grain and received USDA-GIPSA certification for its Afla-V® lateral flow strip tests for the quantitative analysis of total aflatoxins in corn. In 2016, the Company announced a single extraction method for the detection of aflatoxins and fumonisins in corn and grain using the Afla-V® AQUA and Fumo-V® AQUA. 
 Mass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 
 MS is a powerful analytical technology that is used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known materials and to elucidate the structural and chemical properties of molecules by measuring the masses of molecules that have been converted into ions. 
 The Company believes it is a technology and market leader in the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of MS instruments. These instruments are typically integrated and used along with other complementary analytical instruments and systems, such as LC, chemical electrophoresis, chemical electrophoresis chromatography and gas chromatography. A wide variety of instrumental designs fall within the overall category of MS instrumentation, including devices that incorporate quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight (Tof), magnetic sector and ion mobility technologies. Furthermore, these technologies are often used in tandem to maximize the speed and/or efficacy of certain experiments. 
 Currently, the Company offers a wide range of MS instrument systems utilizing various combinations of quadrupole, Tof and ion mobility designs. These instrument systems are used in drug discovery and 
 
3 
 
 development, as well as for environmental, clinical and nutritional safety testing. The overwhelming majority of mass spectrometers sold by the Company are designed to utilize an LC system and a liquid compatible interface (such as an electrospray ionization source) as the sample introduction device. These products supply a diverse market with a strong emphasis on the life science, pharmaceutical, biomedical, clinical, food and beverage and environmental market segments worldwide. 
 MS is an increasingly important detection technology for LC. The Companys smaller-sized mass spectrometers, such as the single quadrupole detector (SQD) and the tandem quadrupole detector (TQD), are often referred to as LC detectors and are typically sold as part of an LC system or as an LC system upgrade. Larger quadrupole systems, such as the Xevo® TQ and Xevo® TQ-S instruments, are used primarily for experiments performed for late-stage drug development, including clinical trial testing. Quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TofTM) instruments, such as the Companys SYNAPT® G2-S, are often used to analyze the role of proteins in disease processes, an application sometimes referred to as proteomics. In 2014, the Company introduced the ionKey/MSTM system, Xevo® G2-XS and Xevo® TQ-S micro. The ionKey/MS system physically integrates a UPLC separation into the mass spectrometer, producing a significant improvement in sensitivity with reduced solvent and sample sizes. The Xevo G2-XS mass spectrometer combines the new XS Collision Cell with the signature technologies of Tof-MRM, StepWaveTM and QuanTofTM. The Xevo TQ-S micro is a more compact, research-grade instrument designed to acquire sensitive, robust and dependable data at accelerated rates of acquisition. In 2015, the Company introduced the GlycoWorks® RapiFluor-MS® N-Glycan Kit, which enables fast de-glycosylation and labeling, reduces sample preparation time and allows mass detection for characterization and development with enhanced sensitivity. In addition, the Company introduced the Vion® IMS Q-TofTM Mass Spectrometer in 2015, which is a bench-top tandem mass spectrometer featuring ion mobility and Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMSTM) Research System with iKnifeTM sampling to combine direct-from-sample ionization with high performance time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In 2016, the Company introduced the Xevo® TQ-XS mass spectrometry system enabled by the newly designed StepWaveTM SX ion guide, which features a unique combination of ion optics, detection and ionization technologies resulting in levels of sensitivity not previously seen. The Company also introduced SONAR in 2016, which is a new data acquisition technology for use with the Xevo G2-XS that allows for the quantification and identification of lipids, metabolites and proteins in complex samples in a more efficient manner. 
 In July 2014, the Company acquired the net assets of Medimass Research, Development and Service Kft. (Medimass), a developer of mass spectrometry-related technologies with the potential to be used for a variety of applications, for $23 million in cash. In addition, the Company potentially has to pay additional contingent consideration, which had an estimated fair value of $3 million as of the closing date. The net assets acquired consist primarily of the REIMS technology, including patent applications, software, databases and REIMS expertise. REIMS is an ambient pressure surface ionization technique that, when used with mass spectrometry, can characterize the molecular topography of complex surfaces, such as cellular membranes. 
 In November 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of MPE Orbur Group Limited and its sole operating subsidiary, Midland Precision Equipment Company, Ltd. (MPE), a manufacturer of MS instrumentation components, for $12 million, net of cash acquired. MPE is a highly skilled manufacturer and former Waters supplier that produces critical components that support the Companys MS instrument systems. 
 LC and MS are typically embodied within an analytical system tailored for either a dedicated class of analyses or as a general purpose analytical device. An increasing percentage of the Companys customers are purchasing LC and MS components simultaneously and it has become common for LC and MS instrumentation to be used within the same laboratory and operated by the same user. The descriptions of LC and MS above reflect the historical segmentation of these analytical technologies and the historical categorization of their respective practitioners. Increasingly in todays instrument market, this segmentation and categorization is becoming obsolete as a high percentage of instruments used in the laboratory embody both LC and MS technologies as part of a single device. In response to this development and to further promote the high utilization of these hybrid instruments, the Company has organized its Waters operating segment to develop, manufacture, sell and service integrated LC-MS systems.

Based upon reports from independent marketing research firms and publicly-disclosed sales figures from competitors, the Company believes that it is one of the worlds largest manufacturers and distributors of LC and LC-MS instrument systems, chromatography columns and other consumables and related services. The Company also believes that it has the leading combined LC and LC-MS market share in the United States, Europe and Asia (excluding Japan), and believes it may have a market share position in Japan that ranks second to an established domestic supplier. 
 The Company has been a developer and supplier of software-based products that interface with the Companys instruments, as well as other suppliers instruments. The Companys newest software platform, UNIFI®, is a scientific information system that is the culmination of a multi-year effort to substantially bring all of Waters preexisting, distinct software systems under one operating system. UNIFI joins Waters suite of informatics products  Empower® Chromatography Data Software, MassLynx® Mass Spectrometry Software and NuGenesis® Scientific Data Management System, each of which is used to support innovations within world-leading institutions. UNIFI is the industrys first comprehensive software that seamlessly integrates UPLC chromatography, mass spectrometry and informatics data workflows. In 2014, the Company introduced three new UNIFI-based instrument systems and now offers a total of eight UNIFI-based solutions. In 2015, the Companys introduction of the Vion IMS Q-Tof Mass Spectrometer marks the first Waters mass spectrometer to be fully supported on UNIFI. In 2016, the Company announced two reference libraries available within UNIFI, the Metabolic Profiling CCS Library and the RapiFluor-MS® Glycan GU Scientific Library. The Company also introduced Symphony Data Pipeline software in 2016, which is a client-server application that automates the movement and transformation of large amounts of LC-MS data to speed up analytical workflows and liberate scientists from mundane yet necessary tasks associated with managing data files. 
 Waters Service 
 Services provided by Waters enable customers to maximize technology productivity, support customer compliance activities and provide transparency into enterprise resource management efficiencies. The customer benefits from improved budget control, data-driven technology adoption and accelerated workflow at a site or on a global perspective. The Company considers its service offerings to be highly differentiated from our competition, as evidenced by a consistent increase in annual service revenues. The Companys principal competitors in the service market include PerkinElmer, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and General Electric Company. These competitors can provide certain services on Waters instruments to varying degrees and always present competitive risk. 
 The servicing and support of instruments, software and accessories is an important source of revenue and represents over 30% of sales for Waters. These revenues are derived primarily through the sale of support plans, demand services, spare parts, customer performance validation services and customer training. Support plans typically involve scheduled instrument maintenance and an agreement to promptly repair a non-functioning instrument in return for a fee described in a contract that is priced according to the configuration of the instrument. 
 TA Products and Markets 
 Thermal Analysis, Rheometry and Calorimetry 
 Thermal analysis measures the physical or thermodynamic characteristics of materials as a function of temperature. Changes in temperature affect several characteristics of materials, such as their heat flow characteristics, physical state, weight, dimension and mechanical and electrical properties, which may be measured by one or more thermal analysis techniques, including calorimetry. Consequently, thermal analysis techniques are widely used in the development, production and characterization of materials in various industries, such as plastics, chemicals, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and electronics. 
 Rheometry instruments often complement thermal analyzers in characterizing materials. Rheometry characterizes the flow properties of materials and measures their viscosity, elasticity and deformation under 
 
5 
 
 different types of loading or other conditions. The information obtained under such conditions provides insight into a materials behavior during processing, packaging, transport, usage and storage. 
 Thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are heavily used in material testing laboratories and, in many cases, provide information useful in predicting the suitability and stability of industrial polymers, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, metals and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research. As with systems offered by Waters, a range of instrument configurations is available with increasing levels of sample handling and information processing automation. In addition, systems and accompanying software packages can be tailored for specific applications. In 2015, TA introduced the TAM IV and TAM IV-48, which extend the operating temperature range (4°C to 150°C) with long-term temperature stability for measuring processes. In 2015, TA also introduced the Affinity ITC and ITC Auto, which are designed for the most challenging life science laboratory environments that require high sensitivity, high productivity and the most advanced isothermal titration calorimetry. In 2016, TA introduced a new line of differential scanning calorimeters and thermogravimetric analyzers. These new Discovery DSC systems feature enhanced sensing technologies resulting in unprecedented performance in baseline flatness, sensitivity, resolution and reproducibility. In addition, TA introduced the ACS-2 Air Chiller System, ElectroForce 3310 test instrument and DuraPulseTM Stent Graft test instrument in 2016. 
 In January 2014, the Company acquired ULSP B.V. (ULSP), a manufacturer of instrumentation components that enable ultra low temperature generation, for $4 million in cash. ULSPs core business is the manufacturing and servicing of high quality low temperature coolers for thermal analysis and rheology applications, and these products are important accessories for many TA core instrument offerings. In 2014, TA introduced the new Air Chiller System, ACS-3, which is equipped with a three-stage cascading compressor design, enabling testing to temperatures as low as -100°C, a capability that the Company believes competing systems do not possess. 
 In May 2015, the Company acquired the net assets of the ElectroForce® business of the Bose Corporation (ElectroForce), a manufacturer of testing systems, for $9 million in cash. ElectroForces core business is the manufacturing of dynamic mechanical testing systems used to characterize medical devices, biologic and engineered materials. The ElectroForce test instruments are based on unique motor designs that are quiet, energy-efficient and scalable, while delivering precise performance over a wide range of force and frequency. 
 In September 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Rubotherm GmbH (Rubotherm), a manufacturer of gravimetric analysis systems, for approximately $6 million in cash, $5 million of which was paid at closing and an additional $1 million paid after closing to settle certain liabilities. Rubotherm develops and manufactures analytical test instruments for thermogravimetric and sorption measurements that are used in both industrial and academic research laboratories in disciplines that include chemistry, material science and engineering. The Rubotherm acquisition will help support and further expand product offerings within TAs thermal analysis business. 
 TA Service 
 Similar to Waters, the servicing and support of TAs instruments is an important source of revenue and represents more than 25% of sales for TA. TA operates independently from the Waters operating segment, though many of its overseas offices are situated in Waters facilities to achieve operational efficiencies. TA has dedicated field sales and service operations. Service sales are primarily derived from the sale of support plans, replacement parts and billed labor fees associated with the repair, maintenance and upgrade of installed systems. 
 Customers 
 The Company typically has a broad and diversified customer base that includes pharmaceutical accounts, other industrial accounts, universities and governmental agencies. Purchase of the Companys instrument systems is 
 
6 
 
 often dependent on its customers capital spending, or funding as in the cases of governmental, academic and research institutions, which often fluctuate from year to year. The pharmaceutical segment represents the Companys largest sector and includes multinational pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers, contract research organizations (CROs) and biotechnology companies. The Companys other industrial customers include chemical manufacturers, polymer manufacturers, food and beverage companies and environmental testing laboratories. The Company also sells to universities and governmental agencies worldwide. The Companys technical sales and support staff members work closely with its customers in developing and implementing applications that meet their full range of analytical requirements. During 2016, 56% of the Companys sales were to pharmaceutical accounts, 31% to other industrial accounts and 13% to governmental agencies and academic institutions. 
 The Company typically experiences an increase in sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits for capital goods of many customers who tend to exhaust their spending budgets by calendar year end. The Company does not rely on any single customer for a material portion of its sales. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of the Companys net sales. 
 Sales and Service 
 The Company has one of the largest direct sales and service organizations focused exclusively on the technologies offered by the Company. Across these product technologies, using respective specialized sales and service workforces, the Company serves its customer base with 91 sales offices throughout the world as of December 31, 2016 and approximately 3,600, 3,400 and 3,100 field representatives in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This investment in sales and service personnel serves to maintain and expand the Companys installed base of instruments. The Companys sales representatives have direct responsibility for account relationships, while service representatives work in the field to install instruments, train customers and minimize instrument downtime. In-house and field-based technical support representatives work directly with customers, providing them assistance with applications and procedures on Company products. The Company provides customers with comprehensive information through various corporate and regional internet websites and product literature, and also makes consumable products available through electronic ordering facilities and a dedicated catalog.

 Raw Materials 
 The Company purchases a variety of raw materials, primarily consisting of high temperature alloy sheet metal and castings, forgings, pre-plated metals and electrical components from various vendors. The materials used by the Companys operations are generally available from a number of sources and in sufficient quantities to meet current requirements subject to normal lead times. 
 The Company is subject to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Companys products, are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. In 2015, the Company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2016 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2016 Form SD with the SEC in May 2017. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Companys ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products. 
 In addition, the Company continues to monitor environmental health and safety regulations in countries in which it operates throughout the world, in particular, European Union and China Restrictions on the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS) and European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. Further information regarding these regulations is available on the Companys website, www.waters.com, under the caption About Waters / Environmental Health & Safety.

Research and Development 
 The Company maintains an active research and development program focused on the development and commercialization of products that extend, complement and update its existing product offering. The Companys research and development expenditures for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $125 million, $119 million and $108 million, respectively. In addition, in 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred charges of $4 million and $15 million, respectively, for acquired in-process research and development related to the licensing of certain intellectual property relating to mass spectrometry technologies yet to be commercialized and for which there was no future alternative use as of the acquisition date. These licensing arrangements are significantly related to new, biologically-focused applications, as well as other applications, and require the Company to make additional future payments of up to $12 million if certain milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on future net sales. 
 Nearly all of the Companys LC products have been developed at the Companys main research and development center located in Milford, Massachusetts, with input and feedback from the Companys extensive field organizations and customers. The majority of the Companys MS products are developed at facilities in England and most of the Companys current materials characterization products are developed at the Companys research and development center in New Castle, Delaware. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were 971, 955 and 875 employees, respectively, involved in the Companys research and development efforts. The Company has increased research and development expenses from its continued commitment to invest significantly in new product development and existing product enhancements, and as a result of acquisitions. Despite the Companys active research and development programs, there can be no assurance that the Companys product development and commercialization efforts will be successful or that the products developed by the Company will be accepted by the marketplace. 
 Employees 
 The Company employed approximately 6,900, 6,600 and 6,200 employees at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with approximately 42% of the Companys employees located in the United States. The Company believes its employee relations are generally good. The Companys employees are not unionized or affiliated with any internal or external labor organizations. The Company firmly believes that its future success largely depends upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. 
Competition 
 The analytical instrument systems, supplies and services market is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several worldwide suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets for each of its three primary technologies. The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of product performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Competitors continuously introduce new products and have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Companys business. Some competitors have greater financial resources and broader distribution than the Companys. 
 In the markets served by Waters, the Companys principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Bruker Corporation, Danaher Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the markets served by TA, the Companys principal competitors include: PerkinElmer, Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern Instruments Ltd. and Anton-Paar GmbH. 
 The market for consumable LC products, including separation columns, is highly competitive and generally more fragmented than the analytical instruments market. The Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column sorbents and small specialized companies that primarily pack purchased sorbents into columns and subsequently package and distribute

 columns. The Company believes that it is one of the few suppliers that processes silica and polymeric resins, packs columns and distributes its own products. The Company competes in this market on the basis of performance, reproducibility, reputation and, to a lesser extent, price. In recent years, the Companys principal competitors for consumable products have included: Danaher Corporation; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; General Electric Company and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instruments. 
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
 The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents and has patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Certain technology and software has been acquired or is licensed from third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The Companys patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as valuable assets to its operations. However, the Company believes that no one patent or group of patents, trademark or license is, in and of itself, essential to the Company such that its loss would materially affect the Companys business as a whole. 
Environmental Matters and Climate Change 
 The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that (i) govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, and (ii) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up and certain damages resulting from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations and has operated its business in the past in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. From time to time, Company operations have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. The Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental laws. 
 The Company is sensitive to the growing global debate with respect to climate change. An internal sustainability working group develops increasingly robust data with respect to the Companys utilization of carbon producing substances in an effort to continuously reduce the Companys carbon footprint. In 2012, the Company published a sustainability report identifying the various actions and behaviors the Company has adopted concerning its commitment to both the environment and the broader topic of social responsibility. See Item 1A, Risk Factors  The effects of climate change could harm the Companys business, for more information on the potential significance of climate change legislation.
