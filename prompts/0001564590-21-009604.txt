ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 Addus has been providing home care services since 1979. We now operate in three segments: personal care, hospice, and home health. Our services are principally provided in-home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our consumers are predominantly “dual eligible,” meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
 As of December 31, 2020, we provided services in 22 states through approximately 214 offices. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we served approximately 66,000, 61,000 and 57,000 discrete consumers, respectively. 
 
In 2016, Addus refined its strategy to focus on growth in the states in which we have a current presence while adding clinical care services to our offerings. With the purchase of Queen City Hospice in the fourth quarter of 2020, and Ambercare Corporation (“Ambercare”) in the second quarter of 2018, we now have the opportunity to provide all three levels of care, personal care, home health and hospice services, in Ohio and New Mexico and strategically continue to pursue other markets.
 A summary of our financial results for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is provided in the table below.

Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors, as appropriate. Changes in a consumer’s conditions are evaluated by appropriately trained managers and may result in a report to the consumer’s case manager at a managed care organization or other payor. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer’s conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.
 We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and, as a result, managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations. 
 In 2019, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) expanded the scope of its “primarily health-related” supplemental benefit standard, permitting Medicare Advantage plans to cover a broader array of services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-home care. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and has increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population. 
 Our Market and Opportunity
 We provide home care services that primarily include personal care services to assist with activities of daily living, as well as hospice and home health services. These services allow the elderly and other infirm adults who require long-term care and assistance with activities of daily living to maintain their independence at home with their families. Personal care services are a significant component of home and community-based services (“HCBS”), which have grown in significance and demand in recent years and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect demand for home-based services to continue to grow due to the aging of the U.S. 
 3


population, increased life expectancy, and improved opportunities for individuals to receive home-based care as an alternative to institutional care. The population over the age of 65 nationally has been consistently growing and the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that starting in 2030, when all baby boomers will be older than 65, Americans 65 years and older will make up 21% of the population, up from 15% today. 
 Many states use both fee-for-service and managed care delivery models for personal care services, and the number of beneficiaries served through managed care continues to grow. As of July 2019, 40 states contracted with comprehensive, risk-based managed care organizations to serve their Medicaid enrollees, with 21 of those states enrolling at least 75% of all elderly beneficiaries or those with disabilities in managed care organizations. In 23 states, some or all long-term services and support is covered through Medicaid managed care arrangements. 
 The demand for long-term services and supports, which include personal care services, is expected to increase, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of personal care services in the larger continuum of health care services. Beyond government-sponsored programs and other third party payors, we offer our private pay consumers the same personal care services.
 Because our model serves an aging population in a home setting at a lower cost, we believe that we have favorable opportunities for growth. Historically, there were limited barriers to entry in the home-based services industry. As a result, the personal care, home health and hospice service industries developed in a highly fragmented manner, with few large participants and many small ones. Few companies have a significant market share across multiple regions or states. The lack of licensure or certification requirements in some states makes it difficult to estimate the number of home-based services agencies. We expect ongoing consolidation within our industry, driven by the desire of healthcare systems and managed care organizations to narrow their networks of service providers, and as a result of the industry’s increasingly complex regulatory, operating and technology requirements. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on a consolidating industry given our reputation in the market, strong payor relationships and integration of technology into our business model.
 The personal care services industry is subject to increasing regulation. At the federal level, efforts have focused on improved coordination of regulation across the various types of Medicaid programs through which personal care services are offered. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act, as amended, mandated that states implement electronic visit verification (“EVV”), which is used to collect home visit data, such as when the visit begins and ends. In several states, providers are now required to obtain state licenses or registrations and must comply with laws and regulations governing standards of practice. Providers must dedicate substantial resources to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable regulations and significant expenditures may be necessary to offer new services or to expand into new markets. We believe licensing requirements and regulations, including EVV, the increasing focus on improving health outcomes, the rising cost and complexity of operations and technology and pressure on reimbursement rates due to constrained government resources may discourage new providers and may encourage industry consolidation.
 The Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office (“MMCO”) was established within CMS to improve services for consumers who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, also known as “dual eligibles,” and improve coordination between the federal government and states to enhance access to quality services to which they are entitled. The MMCO works with state Medicaid agencies, other federal and state agencies, physicians and others, to make available technical assistance and educational tools to improve care coordination between Medicare and Medicaid and to reduce costs and improve beneficiary experience while reducing administrative and regulatory barriers between the programs. For example, the Financial Alignment Initiative is a demonstration project that tests capitated models and managed fee-for-service models of integrated care and payment for benefits provided to “dual eligibles.” In addition, in December 2020, CMS announced a direct contracting model opportunity that aims to allow Medicaid managed care organizations to better coordinate care for dually eligible Medicaid managed care enrollees. CMS anticipates that some arrangements under the model may include use of care coordinators or in-home aides to provide long-term services and supports. Managed care direct contracting entities may begin participating in the model in January 2022.
 We believe that our personal care program and our technology make us well-suited to partner with managed care organizations to address the needs of the “dual eligible” population, and we believe that our ability to identify changes in our consumers’ health and condition before acute intervention is required will lower the overall cost of care. We believe this approach to care delivery and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare continuum are particularly attractive to managed care organizations and others who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs of our consumers and over time will increase our business with them.
 Our Growth Strategy
 The growth of our revenues is closely correlated with the number of consumers to whom we provide our services. Our continued growth depends on our ability to provide consistently high quality care, maintain our existing payor relationships, establish relationships with new payors and increase our referral sources. Our continued growth is also dependent upon the authorization by state agencies of new consumers to receive our services. We believe there are several market opportunities for growth. The U.S. population of persons aged 65 continues to grow, and the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that this population will nearly double in size by 2060, according to projections published in March 2018. Additionally, we believe the overwhelming majority of individuals in 
 4


need of care generally prefer to receive care in their homes. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened this preference due to health concerns that may be associated with institutional settings for long-term care, along with temporary visitor restrictions that have been imposed. Finally, we believe the provision of home-based services is more cost-effective than the provision of similar services in institutional settings for long-term care. We plan to continue our revenue growth and margin improvement and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following growth strategies:
 Consistently Provide High-Quality Care 
 We schedule and require our caregivers to perform their services as defined within the individual plan of care. We monitor the performance of our caregivers through regular supervisory visits in the homes of consumers. Our caregivers are provided with pre-service training and orientation and an evaluation of their skills. In many cases, caregivers are also required to attend ongoing in-service education. In certain states, our caregivers are required to complete certified training programs and maintain a state certification. The training provided assists to identify changes in our consumers’ health and condition before acute intervention is required, which we believe lowers the overall cost of care.
Drive Organic Growth in Existing Markets
 We intend to drive organic growth through several initiatives, including continuing to build and enhance our sales and marketing capabilities, enhancing our business intelligence analytic capabilities and investing in technology and operations to drive efficiencies. We also expect our organic growth will benefit from an increase in demand for our services by an aging population and our increased alignment with referral sources and payors. We continue to selectively open new offices in existing markets when an opportunity is identified and appropriate.
Market to Managed Care Organizations
 As a scaled, national provider of home-based care, we are partnering with managed care organizations, taking advantage of an industry shift from traditional fee-for-service Medicaid and toward managed care models, which aim to better coordinate care. We expect this shift to lead to narrower provider networks where we can be competitive by offering a larger, more experienced partner to these organizations, as well as by providing more sophisticated technology, electronic visit records and an outcomes-driven approach to service. We believe our coordinated care model and integration of services into the broader healthcare industry are particularly attractive to managed care organizations. In particular, our expansion from primarily personal care services into hospice and home health has increased our value to our managed care partners by diversifying our home-based care offerings.
Grow Through Acquisitions
 In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new markets. We completed four acquisitions in 2020, despite the challenges and disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic including, A Plus Health Care, Inc. (“A Plus”) on July 1, 2020, County Homemakers, Inc. (“County Homemakers”) on November 1, 2020, SLHC, Inc., d/b/a SunLife Home Care (“SunLife Home Care”) on December 1, 2020 and Queen City Hospice on December 4, 2020. During 2019, we completed four acquisitions, one of which, VIP Healthcare Services (“VIP”), was completed on June 1, 2019, two of which, Alliance Home Health Care (“Alliance”) and Foremost Home Care (“Foremost”), were completed on August 1, 2019 and one of which, Hospice Partners of America, LLC (“Hospice Partners”), was completed on October 1, 2019. Acquisitions completed in 2020 accounted for $12.1 million in net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Acquisitions completed in 2019 accounted for $108.2 million and $55.8 million in net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Acquisitions completed in 2018 accounted for $158.1 million, $113.2 million and $75.2 million in net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 Our active pipeline and strong financial position support additional acquisitions. With rising consolidation pressures in the industry, our focus is on identifying growing markets with favorable demographics in states that are fiscally well managed and have a reasonable minimum wage environment and where we have the potential to become one of the leading providers in the state in order to support our managed care organization strategy. We believe our experience identifying and executing on opportunities generated by our acquisition pipeline, as well as our history of integrating acquisitions, will lead to additional consolidation.

Our Services
 We operate in three business segments: (i) personal care (ii) hospice and (iii) home health. Without our services, many of our consumers would be at increased risk of placement in a long-term care institution.
Personal Care
 Our personal care segment provides non-medical assistance with activities of daily living, primarily to persons who are at increased risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill or disabled. The services we provide include assistance with bathing, grooming, oral care, feeding and dressing, medication reminders, meal planning and preparation, housekeeping and transportation services. Many consumers need such services on a long-term basis to address chronic or acute conditions. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities. Each payor client establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services, and establishes the applicable reimbursement rate in accordance with applicable law, regulations or contracts. 
Hospice
 Our hospice segment provides physical, emotional and spiritual care for people who are terminally ill as well as related services for their families. The hospice services we provide include palliative nursing care, social work, spiritual counseling, homemaker services and bereavement counseling. Generally, patients receiving hospice services have a life expectancy of six months or less.
Home Health
 Our home health segment provides services that are primarily medical in nature to individuals who may require assistance during an illness or after hospitalization and include skilled nursing and physical, occupational and speech therapy. We generally provide home health services on a short-term, intermittent or episodic basis to individuals, typically to assist patients recovering from an illness or injury.
 We measure the performance of each segment using a number of different metrics. For the personal care segment, these include average billable census, billable hours, average billable hours per census per month, billable hours per business day, revenues per billable hour and same store growth revenue by percent. For the hospice segment, these include new admissions, average daily census, average length of stay and revenue per patient day. For the home health segment, these include admissions, recertifications, total volume and number of visits. See Part II, Item 6—“Selected Financial Data” for more information on the Company’s metrics.
 Our Payors
 Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. The federal, state and local programs under which these organizations operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. Managed care organizations that operate as an extension of our government payors are subject to similar economic pressures. Our commercial insurance payor clients are typically for profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs.
 Most of our services are provided pursuant to agreements with state and local governmental social and aging service agencies. These agreements generally have an initial term of one to two years and may be terminated with 60 days’ notice. They are typically renewed for one to five-year terms, provided that we have complied with licensing, certification and program standards, and other regulatory requirements. Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and service type, but are typically based on an hourly or unit-of-service basis. Managed care organizations are becoming an increasing portion of our personal care segment payor mix as states shift from administering fee-for-service programs to utilizing managed care models. In our personal care segment during 2020, approximately 50.2% of our net service revenues were derived from state and local government programs, with 44.3% derived from managed care organizations, while approximately 3.2% and 1.5% of net service revenues were derived from private pay consumers and commercial insurance programs, respectively.

For 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenue mix by payor type was as follows:
 
 
 | Years Ended December 31, | 
---------------------------------------------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | 
Personal Care | | | | | | | |

Managed care organizations | | 19.6 | | 20.3 | | | 11.0 | 
Other | | 1.8 | | 2.1 | | | 1.0 | 

 
We derive a significant amount of our revenues from our operations in Illinois, New York and New Mexico. The percentages of total revenue for each of these significant states for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:
 
 
 | Years Ended December 31, | 
-----------------+--------------------------+------
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | 
Personal Care | | | | | | | | 
Illinois | | 44.6 | % | 42.6 | | % | 47.3 | %
New York | | 17.8 | | 18.7 | | | 13.3 | 
New Mexico | | 13.4 | | 13.0 | | | 12.0 | 
All other states | | 24.2 | | 25.7 | | | 27.4 | 
Hospice | | | | | | | | 
New Mexico | | 42.1 | % | 72.4 | | % | 100.0 | %
All other states | | 57.9 | | 27.6 | | | — | 
Home Health | | | | | | | | 
New Mexico | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | | % | 100.0 | %

 
A significant amount of our revenue is derived from one payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, the largest payor program for our Illinois personal care operations, which accounted for 23.0%, 25.3% and 31.7% of our net service revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 The state of Illinois finalized its fiscal year 2020 budget with the inclusion of an appropriation to raise in-home care rates to offset the costs of previous minimum wage increases in Chicago and other areas of the state that were imposed beginning on July 1, 2018. These rates were originally set to be effective July 1, 2019, with in-home care rates to be initially increased by 10.9% to $20.28 from $18.29 to partially offset the costs of the minimum wage hikes. Rates were then further increased on January 1, 2020 by an additional 7.7% to $21.84, providing full funding for both the Chicago minimum wage increases and a statewide raise for all current in-home caregivers. 
 The Illinois Department on Aging, in conjunction with Illinois’ Health Care and Family Services, announced that the new rates would become effective retroactive to July 1, 2019 for services covered by managed care organizations. On January 15, 2020, the Department on Aging announced confirmation that a one-time bonus payment would be paid to providers who have provided services to clients not enrolled in a managed care organization, for the time period of July 1, 2019 through November 30, 2019 using an updated hourly rate of $20.28. The bonus payment of $6.8 million was recognized as net service revenues as of December 31, 2019.
 
On November 26, 2019, the Chicago City Council voted to approve additional increases in the Chicago minimum wage to $14 per hour beginning July 1, 2020 to $15 per hour beginning July 1, 2021. The Company and its trade association will be looking for additional funding in the state of Illinois fiscal year 2022 budget to offset the cost of the July 1, 2021 additional minimum wage increases.
 The state of Illinois finalized its fiscal year 2021 budget, with in-home care rates to be increased by 7.1% to $23.40 from $21.84, effective January 1, 2021, contingent upon federal CMS approval. Although federal CMS approval was obtained by the state, 
 7


as a result of on-going state revenue declines due to COVID-19 and the failure of the November 2020 referendum to revise the Illinois income tax code, on December 15, 2020, the Governor of Illinois announced a delay in the implementation of the scheduled rate increase to April 1, 2021. 
 Our business will benefit from the rate increases noted above, but there is no assurance that additional offsetting rate increases will be adopted in Illinois for fiscal years beyond fiscal year 2021, and our financial performance will be adversely impacted for any periods in which an additional offsetting reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market specific. Each local market has its own competitive profile and no single competitor has significant market share across all of our markets. Our competition consists of personal care service providers, home health providers, hospice providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations, managed care organizations and self-directed care programs. In addition, certain governmental payors contract for services with independent providers such that our relationships with these payors are not exclusive. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into our markets. It is unclear how increased use of telecommunications technology across our service lines, which was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, will affect competition, as it presents both challenges and opportunities. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, and name recognition with consumers and payors.
Sales and Marketing
 We focus on initiating and maintaining working relationships with state and local governmental agencies responsible for the provision of the services we offer. We target these agencies in our current markets and in geographical areas that we have identified as potential markets for expansion. We also seek to identify service needs or changes in the service delivery or reimbursement system of governmental entities and attempt to work with and provide input to the responsible government personnel, provider associations and consumer advocacy groups.
 We establish new referral relationships with various managed care organizations that contract with the states for the servicing of the state Medicaid programs. We have met with many contracted managed care organizations in markets we serve and believe we are building the relationships necessary to generate continued referrals of new clients.
 We receive substantially all of our personal care consumers through third-party referrals, including state departments on aging, rehabilitation, mental health and children’s services, county departments of social services, managed care organizations, the Veterans Health Administration and city departments on aging. Generally, family members of potential consumers are made aware of available in-home or alternative living arrangements through state or local case management systems. These systems are operated by governmental or private agencies. 
 We provide ongoing education and outreach in our target communities in order to inform the community about state and locally-subsidized care options and to communicate our role in providing quality personal care services. We also utilize consumer-directed sales, marketing and advertising programs designed to attract consumers. 
 With respect to our hospice and home health patients, we receive substantially all of our referrals through other health care providers, such as hospitals, physicians, nursing homes and assisted living facilities. We have a team of community liaisons in our hospice and home health operations that educate and develop relationships with other health care providers and the community at large.
 Payment for Services
 We are reimbursed for substantially all of our services by federal, state and local government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid state programs, managed care organizations, other state agencies and the Veterans Health Administration. In addition, we are reimbursed by commercial insurance and private pay consumers. Depending on the type of service, coverage for services may be predicated on a case manager, physician or nurse determination that the care is necessary or on the development of a plan for care in the home. A significant amount of our net service revenues from our personal care segment are derived from one specific payor client, the Illinois Department on Aging, which accounted for 23.0%, 25.3% and 31.7% of our net service revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 8


Illinois Department on Aging
 We provide personal care services pursuant to agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging, which coordinates programs and community-based services intended to improve quality of life and preserve the independence of older individuals. The Illinois Department on Aging is funded by Medicaid and general revenue funds of the state of Illinois, and also receives funding available under the federal Older Americans Act (“OAA”). The Department on Aging’s Community Care Program (“CCP”) provides adult day service, emergency home response and in-home services, including some personal care services to individuals who are age 60 and over and meet other eligibility requirements. Some of these services are provided through Medicaid waivers granted by CMS. 
 Consumers are identified by case managers contracted independently with the Illinois Department on Aging. Once a consumer has been evaluated and determined to be eligible for a program, an assigned case manager refers the consumer to a list of authorized providers, from which the consumer selects the provider. We provide our services in accordance with a care plan developed by the case manager and under administrative directives from the Illinois Department on Aging. We are reimbursed on an hourly fee-for-service basis. 
 Other Federal, State and Local Payors
 Medicare
 Medicare is a federal program that provides medical services to persons aged 65 or older and other qualified persons with disabilities or end-stage renal disease. Each of our hospice and home care agencies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program in order to continue receiving Medicare reimbursement.
Hospice
 Medicare beneficiaries who have a terminal illness and a life expectancy of six months or less may elect to receive hospice benefits (i.e., palliative services for management of a terminal illness) in lieu of standard Medicare coverage for treatment. Hospice services are paid under the Medicare Hospice Prospective Payment System (“HPPS”), under which CMS sets a daily rate for each day a patient is enrolled in the hospice benefit. Hospice payment rates increased by 2.4% for federal fiscal year 2021, which reflects a 2.4% market basket update; reduced by the multifactor productivity adjustment of 0.04 percentage points. CMS requires various providers, including hospice providers, to submit quality reporting data each year. Hospices that do not satisfy quality reporting requirements are subject to a 2 percentage point reduction to the market basket percentage update. Additionally, hospice companies are subject to two specific payment limit caps under the Medicare program each federal fiscal year: the inpatient cap and the aggregate cap. The inpatient cap limits the number of inpatient care days provided to no more than 20% of the total days of hospice care provided to Medicare patients for the year. If a hospice exceeds the number of allowable inpatient care days, the hospice must refund any amounts received for inpatient care that exceed the total of: (i) the product of the total reimbursement paid to the hospice for inpatient care multiplied by the ratio of the maximum number of allowable inpatient days to the actual number of inpatient care days furnished by the hospice to Medicare patients; and (ii) the product of the number of actual inpatient days in excess of the limitation multiplied by the routine home care rate. The aggregate cap, which is calculated each federal fiscal year, limits the amount of Medicare reimbursement a hospice may receive, based on the number of Medicare patients served. If a hospice’s Medicare payments exceed its aggregate cap, it must repay Medicare for the excess amount. In federal fiscal year 2021, the aggregate cap is $30,683.93.
Home Health
 Effective January 1, 2020, CMS transitioned to 30-day periods of care within each 60-day certification of patient eligibility period and implemented the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (“PDGM”) as the payment model for services provided to Medicare patients with dates of service on or after January 1, 2020. The PDGM replaced the case-mix system, which used the number of visits to determine payment, and classified patients based on clinical characteristics. 
 The intent of the PDGM is to shift toward a value-based payment system and remove the incentive to overprovide care. CMS updates the HHPPS payment rates each calendar year. For calendar year 2021, HHPPS rates increased by 2.0%, which reflects a 2.3% market basket update, reduced by a multifactor productivity adjustment of 0.3 percentage points. CMS expects Medicare payments to home health agencies in 2021 to increase in the aggregate by 1.9% after accounting for the 0.1 percentage point decrease in payments to home health agencies due to changes in the rural add-on percentages also mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Home health providers that do not comply with quality data reporting requirements are subject to a 2 percentage point reduction to their market basket update. 
 Historically, CMS paid home health providers 50% to 60% of anticipated payment at the beginning of a patient’s care episode through a request for anticipated payment (“RAP”). However, to address potential program integrity risks, CMS has phased out RAP payments. In calendar year 2021, CMS will not provide any up-front payments in response to a RAP but will continue to require home 
 9


health providers to submit streamlined RAPs as notice that a beneficiary is under a home health period of care. In calendar year 2022, CMS will replace the RAP with a “Notice of Admission.” 
 Medicaid Programs 
 Medicaid is a state-administered program that provides certain social and medical services to qualified low-income individuals and is jointly funded by the federal government and individual states. Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and service type, but are typically based on an hourly or unit-of-service basis. Rates are subject to adjustment based on statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, government funding limitations and interpretations of policy by individual state agencies. Within guidelines established by federal statutes and regulations, and subject to federal oversight, each state establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services, sets the rate of payment for services and administers its own program. States typically cover Medicaid beneficiaries for intermittent home health services as well as continuous services for children and young adults with complicated medical conditions and cover home and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities.
 Many states are moving the administration of their Medicaid personal care programs to managed care organizations. This transition is due to an overall desire to better manage the costs of the Medicaid long-term care programs. In addition, hospice and home health services are also reimbursed by managed care organizations in many states. Reimbursement from the managed care organizations for personal care services is generally on an hourly, fee-for-service basis with rates consistent with or as a percentage of the individual state funded rates.
 Currently, personal care services and other HCBS are largely reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. States receive permission from CMS to provide personal care services under waivers of traditional Medicaid requirements. In an effort to control escalating Medicaid costs, states are increasingly requiring Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans for better coordination of HCBS and health care services. Medicaid beneficiaries in Illinois are a part of the Health Choice Illinois statewide managed care program, which is serviced by various managed care organizations. The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services has entered into managed care contracts that will expand managed care through the Health Choice Illinois program to reach approximately 80% of Medicaid enrollees. Effective July 1, 2019, the Health Choice Illinois program began coverage for home health and personal care services for certain dual-eligible beneficiaries with HCBS waivers after previously delaying such coverage and enrollment.
 Veterans Health Administration
 The Veterans Health Administration operates the nation’s largest integrated healthcare system, with more than 1,200 healthcare facilities, and provides healthcare benefits, including personal care, hospice and home health services, to eligible military veterans. The Veterans Health Administration provides funding to regional and local offices and facilities that support the in-home care needs of eligible aged and disabled veterans. Services are funded by local Veterans Medical Centers and the aid and attendance pension, which reimburses veterans for their otherwise unreimbursed health and long-term care expenses. We currently have relationships and agreements with the Veterans Health Administration to provide personal care services in several states, principally in California, New Mexico and Illinois.
Other
 Other sources of funding are available to support personal care, hospice and home health services in different states and localities. In addition, many states appropriate general funds or special use funds through targeted taxes or lotteries to finance personal care services for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities. Depending on the state, these funds may be used to supplement existing Medicaid programs or for distinct programs that serve non-Medicaid eligible consumers.
COVID-19 Relief
 On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declared a national public health emergency due to a novel coronavirus. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by this novel coronavirus, a pandemic. This disease continues to spread throughout the United States and other parts of the world.
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and state governments have passed legislation, promulgated regulations, and taken other administrative actions intended to assist healthcare providers in providing care to COVID-19 patients and other patients during the public health emergency. These temporary measures include relief from Medicare conditions of participation requirements for healthcare providers, relaxation of licensure requirements for healthcare professionals, relaxation of privacy restrictions for telehealth remote communications, promoting use of telehealth by expanding the scope of services for which Medicare reimbursement is available, and limited waivers of fraud and abuse laws for activities related to COVID-19 during the emergency period. The current federal public health emergency declaration expires April 21, 2021, but HHS has indicated it will likely extend through 2021. The 
 10


HHS Secretary may renew the declaration for successive 90-day periods for as long as the emergency continues to exist and may terminate the declaration whenever he determines that the emergency no longer exists.
One of the primary sources of relief for healthcare providers is the CARES Act, which was expanded by the PPPHCE Act, and the CAA. In total, the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act and the CAA include $178 billion in funding to be distributed through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (the “Provider Relief Fund”) to eligible providers, including public entities and Medicare- and/or Medicaid-enrolled providers. Provider Relief Fund payments are intended to compensate healthcare providers for lost revenues and health care related expenses incurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and are not required to be repaid, provided that recipients attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including limitations on balance billing and not using funds received from the Provider Relief Fund to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse. 
 In April 2020, the Company received grants in an aggregate principal amount of $6.9 million, for which it did not apply, from the Provider Relief Fund as part of the automatic general distributions by HHS. The Company returned these funds in June 2020. In November 2020, the Company received grants in an aggregate principal amount of $13.7 million from the Provider Relief Fund, for which we applied. The Company utilized $1.4 million of these funds for healthcare related expenses attributable to COVID-19 that were unreimbursed by other sources in the period ended December 31, 2020 and, in accordance with the current guidance issued by HHS, expects to utilize additional funds through June 30, 2021, at which point any unused funds will be returned. We are required to properly and fully document the use of such funds in reports to HHS. The Company’s ability to utilize and retain some or all of such funds will depend on the magnitude, timing and nature of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the terms and conditions of the funds received. In April 2020, Queen City Hospice received grants in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.5 million, for which it did not apply, from the Provider Relief Fund as part of the automatic general distributions by HHS. Queen City Hospice utilized approximately $0.6 million of the funds for healthcare related expenses attributable to COVID-19 that were unreimbursed by other sources. Queen City Hospice intends to repay $1.9 million, which represents the remainder of the grants received but not utilized, in 2021. Commercial organizations that receive annual total awards of $750,000 or more in federal funding, including payments received through the Provider Relief Fund, are subject to federal audit requirements.
 In addition, the CARES Act expands the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to increase cash flow to providers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospice and home health providers were able to request an advance or accelerated payment of up to 100% of the Medicare payment amount for a three-month period (not including Medicare Advantage payments). The Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program payments are a loan that providers must pay back. Recoupment of these payments was due to begin in August, but CMS has delayed the recoupment process for these payments, based on amended repayment terms imposed by the CAA, until one year after payment was issued. In April 2020, Queen City Hospice received an amount equal to $10.8 million pursuant to the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program. Queen City Hospice did not repay the funds prior to the completion of our acquisition of Queen City Hospice, however, Queen City Hospice intends to repay such funds in March 2021, prior to any CMS recoupment and before any interest accrues.
 The CARES Act and related legislation also include other provisions offering financial relief, for example temporarily lifting the Medicare sequester, which would have otherwise reduced payments to Medicare providers by 2%, from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021 (but also extending sequestration through 2030). The Medicare sequester relief resulted in an increase of $0.2 million to home health net service revenues and $1.3 million to hospice net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additional financial relief under the CARES Act includes a temporary 6.2% increase in the federal share of Medicaid spending (also known as Federal Medical Assistance Percentages or FMAP) intended to broadly support the solvency of state Medicaid programs.
 The CARES Act also provides for certain federal income and other tax changes, including the deferral of the employer portion of Social Security payroll taxes. The Company received a cash benefit of approximately $7.1 million related to the deferral of employer payroll taxes for 2020 under the CARES Act, for the period April 2, 2020 through June 30, 2020. Effective July 1, 2020, the Company began paying its deferred portion of employer Social Security payroll taxes and expects to repay the $7.1 million in 2021. 
 As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, the federal government is considering additional stimulus measures, federal agencies continue to issue related regulations and guidance, and the public health emergency continues to evolve. We continue to assess the potential impact of COVID-19 and government responses to the pandemic, including the enactment and implementation of the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act, the CAA and other stimulus legislation, on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 Commercial Insurance
 Most long-term care insurance policies contain benefits for in-home services. Policies are generally subject to dollar limitations on the amount of daily, weekly or monthly coverage provided.
 11


Private Pay
 Our private pay services are provided on an hourly or type of services basis. Our rates are established to achieve a pre-determined gross margin, and are competitive with those of other local providers. We bill our private pay consumers for services rendered weekly, bi-monthly or monthly. Other private payors include workers’ compensation programs/insurance, preferred provider organizations and employers.
Insurance Programs and Costs
 We maintain workers’ compensation, general and professional liability, cyber, automobile, directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary liability and excess liability insurance. We offer various health insurance plans to eligible full-time and part-time employees. We believe our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves are adequate for our current operations. However, we cannot be certain that any potential losses or asserted claims will not exceed such insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves.
Human Capital
 We value our employees and believe they are the reason for our success. We believe that to be a great home care company, we must have great employees. We believe our staff is a group of engaged, energized and compassionate employees whose work allows our consumers and patients the freedom to stay in their homes. 
 
Our caregivers, excluding agency staff, provide substantially all of our services and comprise approximately 95.6% of our total workforce. They undergo a criminal background check and are provided with pre-service training and orientation and an evaluation of their skills. In many cases, caregivers are also required to attend ongoing in-service education. In certain states, our caregivers are required to complete certified training programs and maintain a state certification. Approximately 47.3% of our total employees are represented by labor unions. We maintain strong working relationships with these labor unions. We have numerous collective bargaining agreements with the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”), which are renegotiated from time to time.
 The following is a breakdown of our part- and full-time employees, including the employees in our national support center, as of December 31, 2020:
 
 
 | Full-time | | Part-time | | Total
----------------------------+-----------+-------+-----------+--------+------
Caregivers and agency staff | | 5,632 | | 29,101 | | 34,733
National support centers | | 395 | | 11 | | 406 
 | | 6,027 | | 29,112 | | 35,139

 
We strive to provide the following, among other things. 
 Employee Safety in Light of COVID-19
 Senior management meets frequently to discuss the latest events surrounding COVID-19 and remains vigilant as to the safety of our consumers, patients, caregivers and employees. We have utilized our best commercial efforts to comply with health and safety standards, regulations and guidance provided by regulatory organizations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the United States Department of Labor and others that focus on the safety of employees. Addus has implemented several steps focused on employee safety and in accordance with CDC guidelines, including but not limited to the following; 
  
• | Issued guidance for clinical and field staff with respect to exposure to COVID-19 and return to service;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing PPE to caregivers on a regular basis;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Established various communication methods in order to communicate up-to-date real-time information relative to COVID-19, including on the Addus Intranet and a texting method to provide caregivers direct information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Completed branch and corporate office retro fitting where needed to maintain proper social distancing, implemented prescreen questionnaires and temperature checks; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prepared to provide safe passage letters to caregivers in the case of lockdowns, to prove essential worker status.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recruiting and Development
 Employee recruiting and retention remains a top priority each year for Addus, as we are committed to hiring and retaining excellent employees. We believe that a strong workplace culture focused on employee engagement enables ongoing learning and promotes the development of individual career growth, necessary to successfully retain and develop diverse talent. Addus recognizes 
 12


the importance of employee engagement and we have implemented programs focused on new hire experiences and integration, ongoing learning opportunities though the Addus Learning Academy and Addus Institute of Skilled Care Education (“AISCE”), and mentoring through leadership training. The Addus Learning Academy allows employees to access training and resources necessary to build the skills specifically related to their respective positions at Addus. AISCE provides continuing education courses to support licensing and re-certification for our clinical employees. 
 Communication and Recognition
 We remain focused on the wellness of our employees, through programs, communications and services. We have developed two primary communication tools to distribute information to our branches and administrative employees, the SC Connect and Addus Ink newsletters. Addus Ink is a quarterly newsletter that features local branch content from around the country that is focused on fulfilling our Addus Mission and Values. SC Connect is a biweekly newsletter that features important Company updates, information and resources. We have also implemented the Addus Elite Program, which has three levels of recognition; peer to peer, quarterly recognition and Addus Elite Hall of Fame, designed to celebrate the amazing work our employees do on a daily basis. We believe it is important to acknowledge our colleagues, managers, and direct reports who are living our Addus Mission and Values every day. 
Technology
 We currently utilize multiple applications to support our various lines of business and locations for patient accounting. Each application supports its respective line of business and locations with administrative, office, clinical and operating information system needs, including assisting with the compliance of our operating systems with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requirements. Each assists our staff in gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimize financial performance, promote regulatory compliance and enhance staff efficiency. Each application is hosted by the vendor in a secure data center, which provides multiple redundancies for storage, power, bandwidth and security. 
 In order to comply with current and future state and federal regulations around EVV use, we utilize several different vendors. In states with an “open” model, we are able to choose our vendor and have standardized CellTrak as our preferred EVV vendor. In states mandating the EVV vendor, a “closed” system, we utilize whichever vendor the state has mandated. In both cases, we have built interfaces between the EVV vendor and the patient accounting system utilized in the respective branch location. Our caregivers use a mix of Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”) and mobile applications for EVV. Through these technologies, caregivers are able to report changes in health conditions to a manager for triage and evaluation. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a scheduled shift, track mileage reimbursement, send text messages to the caregivers and communicate basic payroll information.
 We license the Qlik Business Intelligence (“Qlik”) platform to provide historical, current, and forward-looking operational performance analysis. We currently have our personal care business integrated into Qlik to provide a comprehensive view of the business regardless of the application used. Qlik provides high-level historical and current analytical views to measure performance against budget and deliver insight into the various factors driving our execution against our financial, operational, and compliance goals. This analysis is available in summary and detailed views to accommodate user needs from senior management down to operators in the field.
 We utilize the ADPVantage Suite as our base human resources and payroll processing system and use their services and products to manage our leave of absence processes, benefits, 401(k) and flexible spending account administration, garnishment services, payroll tax filings, ACA compliance and filings, and time and attendance. For financial management, we utilize Oracle’s Planning Budgeting Cloud Service as our solution for budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting and Oracle Fusion for the general ledger, accounts payable and fixed assets. 
 Government Regulation
 Overview
 Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Changes in the laws and regulations, including as a result of governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on the definition of permissible activities, the relative cost of doing business, and the methods and amounts of payment for care by both governmental and other payors. In addition, differences among state laws may impede our ability to expand into certain markets. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer administrative civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal or state programs. In addition, the healthcare industry has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, extensive and dynamic change. It is difficult to predict the effect of these changes on budgetary allocations for our services. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.”
 13


Medicare and Medicaid Participation
 To participate in and qualify for reimbursement under Medicare, our home health agencies and hospices must comply with extensive conditions of participation. Likewise, to participate in Medicaid programs, our personal care services, home health agencies and hospices are subject to various requirements imposed by federal and state authorities. If we were to violate the applicable federal and state regulations governing Medicare or Medicaid participation, we could be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and be subject to substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties. 
Health Reform
 The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed many laws and regulations in recent years intended to effect major change within the national healthcare system, the most prominent of which is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “ACA”). As currently structured, the ACA affects how healthcare services are delivered and reimbursed through the expansion of public and private health insurance coverage, reduction of growth in Medicare and Medicaid program spending, and the establishment and expansion of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. However, the future of the ACA is unclear. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and although the current presidential administration has indicated its intent to protect the ACA, it is possible that there may be continued changes to the ACA, its implementation or interpretation. 
 Effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance. As a result of this change, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and determined the rest of the ACA was therefore invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded the case for further consideration of how this decision affects the rest of the law. On November 10, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments regarding the case. The law remains in place pending the appeals process. The elimination of the individual mandate penalty and other changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. 
 The ACA, as enacted, requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. Some of the states use or have applied to use Medicaid waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion provisions, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. CMS administrators have indicated that they intend to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, and states continue to explore payment and delivery reform initiatives, including beneficiary work requirements, and quality of care incentives. Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has also increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design.
 The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, or CMMI, tests innovative payment and service delivery systems to reduce program expenditures while maintaining or enhancing quality. For example, the CMMI has supported testing of new models of care for “dual eligibles,” funding of home health providers that offer chronic care management services, and establishment of pilot programs that bundle acute care hospital services with physician services and post-acute care services, which may include home health services for certain patients. The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (“IMPACT Act”) requires HHS, in conjunction with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, to propose a unified post-acute care payment model by 2023. A unified post-acute care payment system would pay post-acute care providers, such as long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies, under a single framework according to a patient’s characteristics, rather than the post-acute care setting where the patient receives treatment. These systems could have a material impact on our business. It is difficult to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms implemented by HHS, CMMI and other industry participants.
 14


Permits, Licensure and Certificate of Need
 Our hospice, home health and personal care services are authorized and/or licensed under various state and county requirements, which cover a variety of topics including standards regarding the provision of medical or care services, clinical records, personnel, infection control and care plans. Additionally, health care professionals at our agencies are required to be individually licensed or certified under state law. Although our personal care service caregivers are generally not subject to licensure requirements, certain states require them to complete pre- and post-employment training programs, background checks, and, in certain instances, maintain state certification. We believe we are currently licensed appropriately as required by the laws of the states in which we operate in all material respects, but additional licensing requirements may be imposed upon us in existing markets or markets that we enter in the future.
 Some states also require a provider to obtain a certificate of need or permit of approval (“CON”) before establishing, constructing, acquiring or expanding certain health services, operations or facilities or making certain capital expenditures. In order to obtain a CON, a state health planning agency must determine that a need exists for the project, with the intent to avoid unnecessary duplication of services.
 Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Anti-Kickback Laws: The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offering, payment, solicitation or receipt of any remuneration to induce referrals or orders for items or services covered by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that there is a violation if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals. Knowledge of the law or intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be punished by criminal fines, imprisonment, significant civil monetary penalties plus damages of up to three times the total amount of remuneration involved and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act. Many states have similar laws proscribing kickbacks, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for items or services.
 The Stark Law and other Prohibitions on Physician Self-Referral: The federal law commonly known as the “Stark Law” prohibits physicians from referring to an entity that provides certain “designated health services” covered by the Medicare and Medicaid program, including home health services, if they, or their family members, have a financial relationship with the entity receiving the referral, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid from billing these programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral. Violations of the Stark Law may result in denial of payment, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim, which may result in additional penalties imposed under the federal False Claims Act. The statute and regulations also provide for a penalty for a circumvention scheme. We attempt to structure our relationships, including compensation agreements with physicians who serve as medical directors in our home health agencies, to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but we cannot provide assurance that every relationship fully complies. Many states have also enacted statutes similar in scope and purpose to the Stark Law, although these laws may apply to all payors or a greater range of services.
 The False Claims Act: Numerous state and federal laws govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit false claims or statements. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person, company or corporation from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, or which contain false or misleading information. “Knowingly” is defined broadly, and includes submission of a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity. The federal False Claims Act can be used to prosecute fraud involving issues such as coding errors and billing for services not provided. Violations of other statutes, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, can also serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. Among other potential bases for liability is the knowing and improper failure to report and return overpayments received from Medicare or Medicaid in a timely manner following identification of the overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be “identified” when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.
 Every entity that receives at least $5.0 million in Medicaid payments annually must have written policies regarding certain federal and state laws for all employees, contractors and agents. These policies must provide detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections.
 A provider determined to be liable under the False Claims Act may be required to pay three times the amount of actual damages sustained by the federal government, in addition to mandatory civil monetary penalties that may amount to over $20,000 for each false or fraudulent claim. These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. Private parties may initiate whistleblower lawsuits alleging the defrauding of the federal government by a provider and may receive a share of any 
 15


settlement or judgment. When a private party brings an action under the federal False Claims Act, the defendant generally is not made aware of the lawsuit under the federal government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene.
 Many states have similar false claims statutes that impose additional liability for the types of acts prohibited by the False Claims Act.
 Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions: Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed under various other federal and state statutes that prohibit various forms of fraud and abuse, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, fee-splitting restrictions, insurance fraud laws, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any payer, including private insurers. For example, criminal penalties may be imposed upon any person or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds a health care benefit plan, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense or makes a materially false statement in connection with delivery of or payment for health care services by a health care benefit plan. Further, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”) imposes substantial penalties for offering remuneration or other inducements to influence federal healthcare beneficiaries’ decisions to seek specific governmentally reimbursable items or services or to choose particular providers. It also imposes penalties for contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal healthcare program. The CMPL requires a lower burden of proof than some other fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Civil monetary penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In addition to the financial penalties, federal enforcement officials are able to exclude from Medicare or Medicaid any individuals or entities convicted of Medicare or Medicaid fraud or other offenses related to the delivery of items or services under those programs. Persons who have been excluded from the Medicare or Medicaid program may not retain ownership in a participating entity. Participating entities that permit continued ownership by excluded individuals, that contract with excluded individuals, and the excluded individuals themselves, may be penalized.
Payment Integrity
 We are subject to routine and periodic surveys and audits by various governmental agencies and other payors. From time to time, we receive and respond to survey reports containing statements of deficiencies. Periodic and random audits conducted or directed by these agencies could result in a delay in receipt or an adjustment to the amount of reimbursements due or received under federal or state programs.
 Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with third parties to identify improper Medicare and Medicaid payments. By statute, states are required to enter into contracts with RACs to audit payments to Medicaid providers, although states are allowed to request waivers of aspects of this requirement. Further, under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS employs private contractors to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. CMS has transitioned several functions previously performed through other integrity programs (for example, Medicare Zone Program Integrity Contractors or ZPICs) to a consolidated model by engaging Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”) to perform integrity activities such as investigation and audits of claims billed by Medicare providers, including home health and hospice providers.
 From time to time, various federal and state agencies, such as HHS, issue pronouncements that identify practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny, as well as practices that may violate fraud and abuse laws. For example, the Office of the Inspector General issued an Investigative Advisory in 2012 that identified a number of program integrity vulnerabilities in the delivery of personal care services and recommending corrective actions by CMS. In December 2016, CMS issued a bulletin highlighting safeguards that state Medicaid agencies can put in place around personal care services. It has also issued guidance to personal care services agencies and attendants on avoiding improper payments. We believe, but cannot assure you, that our operations comply with the principles expressed by HHS in these reports, advisories and guidance.
 HIPAA, Other Privacy and Security and Data Exchange Requirements
 The HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain healthcare claims and reimbursement payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the U.S. healthcare industry.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations extensively regulate the use, disclosure, confidentiality, availability and integrity of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and provide for a number of individual rights with respect to such information. These requirements apply to most healthcare providers, which are known as “covered entities,” including our Company. Vendors, known as “business associates,” that handle protected health information, on behalf of covered entities must also comply with most HIPAA requirements. A covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.
 16


Covered entities must, among other things, maintain privacy and security policies, train workforce members, maintain physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, enter into confidentiality agreements with business associates, and permit individuals to access and amend their protected health information. In addition, covered entities must report breaches of unsecured (unencrypted) protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 calendar days from the discovery date of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain cases involving large breaches, to the media.
 HIPAA violations may result in criminal penalties and significant civil penalties. Our Company is also subject to other applicable federal or state laws that are more restrictive than HIPAA, which could result in additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities whose inadequate data security programs may expose consumers to fraud, identity theft and privacy intrusions. Various state laws and regulations require entities that maintain individually identifiable information (even if not health-related) to report data breaches to affected individuals and, in some cases, state regulators. 
 Health care providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information. For example, beginning April 5, 2021, health care providers and certain other entities will be subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act that prohibit practices that are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties or other disincentives.
 Although we believe that we are in material compliance with the HIPAA regulations and other federal and state laws and regulations related to privacy and security, inadvertent violations may occur in the course of our business. For this and other reasons, we expect compliance with HIPAA, other privacy and security standards, and other laws and regulations impacting the exchange of health information to continue to impose significant costs on our business lines.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
 We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, transport, use and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. In the event of an accident involving such hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all.
