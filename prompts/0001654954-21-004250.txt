  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
  Form and Year of Organization
 
 American Bio Medica Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated on April 2, 1986 under the laws of the State of New York under the name American Micro Media, Inc. On September 9, 1992, we filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to American Bio Medica Corporation.
 Our Business
 
 We manufacture and sell lateral flow immunoassay tests, primarily for the immediate detection of drugs in urine and oral fluid. Our products are self-contained, cost-effective and user-friendly products that are capable of accurately identifying the presence or absence of drugs in a sample within minutes. The products we manufacture are made 100% in in the United States while our competitors manufacture their products outside the United States, primarily in China. One of our drug testing lines is private labeled for another diagnostic company.
 
 We also provide strip manufacturing, product assembly and packaging services to an unaffiliated third party related to a diagnostic test that they sell outside the United States and, we manufacture a diagnostic product that is sold under a private label by an unaffiliated third party. We sell (via distribution) a number of other products related to the immediate detection of drugs in urine and oral fluid, as well as offering other point of care diagnostic products via distribution.
 
 Beginning in March 2020, we began marketing, via a non-exclusive distribution partnership, a rapid test to detect Covid-19 antibodies in whole blood, serum or plasma. In October 2020, we announced that we also signed a distribution agreement with Co-Diagnostics, Inc. granting us the right to market and sell its EUA issued Logix Smart Covid-19 tests in the United States on a non-exclusive basis. On December 14, 2020, we announced we were distributing a Rapid Covid-19 Antigen test, an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-2 in direct nasopharyngeal (NP) swab from individuals who are suspected of Covid-19 by their healthcare provider.
 
  Our Products
 
 Products for the Detection of Drugs in Urine. We manufacture a number of products that detect the presence or absence of drugs in urine. We offer a number of standard configurations, custom configurations on special order, and different cut-off levels for certain drugs. Cut-off levels are concentrations of drugs or metabolites that must be present in urine (or oral fluid) specimens before a positive result will be obtained. Our urine drugs tests are either 510(k) cleared, CLIA Waived and/or OTC cleared (see “Government Regulations” for information on the regulations related to the sale of our drug tests). We currently manufacture the following urine drug testing product lines:
 
 Rapid Drug Screen® The Rapid Drug Screen, or RDS®, is a patented rapid drug test that detects the presence or absence of 2 to 10 drugs simultaneously in a single urine specimen. The RDS is available as a card only, or as part of a kit that includes a collection cup.
 
 RDS InCup® The patented RDS InCup is a drug-testing cup that detects the presence or absence of 1 to 12 drugs in a urine specimen. The RDS InCup incorporates collection and testing of a urine sample in a single step. Each RDS InCup contains multiple channels, and each channel contains a drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect a single drug.
 
 Rapid TOX® Rapid TOX is a cost-effective drug test in a cassette platform that simultaneously detects the presence or absence of 1 to 10 drugs in a urine specimen. Each Rapid TOX contains one or two channels, and each channel contains a drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect 1-5 drugs.

 Rapid TOX Cup® II. The patented Rapid TOX Cup II is another drug testing cup that detects the presence or absence of 1 to 16 drugs in a urine specimen. The Rapid TOX Cup II also incorporates collection and testing of the urine sample in a single step. Each Rapid TOX Cup II contains multiple channels and each channel contains a single drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect more than one drug. This product is available in two (2) formats; one of which has a smaller cup and testing strips to be more cost competitive.
 
 Private Label Products. We provide a private labeled version of Rapid TOX to an unaffiliated third party for sale globally. In the year ended December 31, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”), sales of these products were not material.
 
 Products for the Detection of Drugs in Oral Fluid. We manufacture drug tests that detect the presence or absence of drugs in oral fluids. These products are easy to use and provide test results within minutes with enhanced sensitivity and detection. As of the date of this report, our oral fluid drug tests are marketed “for forensic use only” or for “employment use only” as well as in markets outside the United States; (see “Government Regulations” for information on the regulations related to the sale of our drug tests). We currently offer the following oral fluid drug tests:
 
 OralStat® OralStat is a patented and patent pending, innovative drug test for the detection of drugs in oral fluids. Each OralStat simultaneously tests for 6 or 10 drugs in an oral fluid specimen.
 
 Private Label Products. We do provide a private labeled version of our OralStat product to an unaffiliated third party for sale outside of the United States. Sales of this product were not material in Fiscal 2020.
 
 Other Products. Throughout Fiscal 2020, we distributed a number of other products related to the detection of substances of abuse as well as products to detect certain infectious disease. We do not manufacture these products. We did not derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of these products in Fiscal 2020.
 
 In March 2020, we began marketing, via a non-exclusive distribution partnership, a rapid test to detect Covid-19 antibodies in whole blood, serum or plasma (the “Covid-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette”). The test is not available for consumer use and is being marketed in full compliance with an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on May 29, 2020. In October 2020, we announced that we also signed a distribution agreement with Co-Diagnostics, Inc. granting us the right to market and sell their EUA issued Logix Smart Covid-19 tests (“Logix Smart Covid-19 Test”) in the United States on a non-exclusive basis. The Logix Smart Covid-19 Test operates using a single step RT-PCR process in lower respiratory tract fluid samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, tracheal aspirate, and upper respiratory tract fluid samples, such as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. And finally, on December 14, 2020, we announced we were distributing a Covid-19 Ag rapid test (“Rapid Covid-19 Antigen Test Cassette”), an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-2 in direct nasopharyngeal (NP) swab from individuals who are suspected of Covid-19 by their healthcare provider. It is intended to aid in the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The test is CE-marked and can be sold to locations outside the United States. The Rapid Antigen test is not for home use or at-home specimen collection. The test provides results in 15 minutes. In Fiscal 2020, we sold $1,567,000 in Covid-19 testing products; which was 37.8% of our net sales in Fiscal 2020.
 
  Our Markets and Distribution Methods
 
  Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment
 
 The Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment market includes people in both inpatient and outpatient treatment for substance abuse. Drug testing is a positive aspect of treatment as it aids in relapse prevention and encourages honesty both within the patient and with outside interactions. In addition, being able to accurately gauge the current drug use by patients enrolled in a substance abuse program is essential so, urine drug testing is an integral part of treatment programs, including physician office-based programs. There is typically a high frequency of testing in this market. We sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors.
 Pain Management
 
 Drug testing in pain management is one of the major tools of adherence monitoring in the assessment of a patient’s predisposition to, and patterns of, misuse/abuse; a vital first step towards establishing and maintaining the safe and effective use of drugs in the treatment of chronic pain. There are many benefits of using an ABMC drug test; these include reducing the risk for toxicity in patients vulnerable to adverse drug effects, detecting patient non-compliance, reducing the risk of therapeutic failure, and avoiding or detecting drug-drug interaction. Additionally, drug testing enhances the physician’s ability to use drugs effectively and minimize costs. We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors.

  Other Clinical
 
 Other Clinical markets include emergency rooms/hospitals, family physician offices and laboratories. There are a number of medical emergencies associated with adverse reactions, accidental drug ingestions, and misuse or abuse of prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications. To address this issue, drug testing is performed so healthcare professionals are able to ascertain the drug status of a patient before they administer pharmaceuticals or other treatment. We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors. We also have a long-term relationship with one of the world’s largest clinical laboratories.
 
  Government (including law enforcement and criminal justice)
 
 The Government market includes federal, state, county and local agencies, including police departments, adult and juvenile correctional facilities, pretrial agencies, probation, drug courts and parole departments at the federal and state levels. A significant number of individuals on parole or probation, or within federal, state, county and local correctional facilities and jails, have one or more conditions to their sentence, including but not limited to, periodic drug-testing and substance abuse treatment. We sell our products in this market through our direct sales force.
 
  Employment/Workplace
 
 The Workplace market consists of pre-employment testing of job applicants, as well as random, cause and post-accident testing of employees. Many employers recognize the financial and safety benefits of implementing drug-free workplace programs, of which drug testing is an integral part. In some states, there are workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance premium reductions, tax deductions and other incentives for adopting these programs. We sell our products in this market through our direct sales force and through a select network of distributors.
 
  International
 
 The International market consists of various markets outside of the United States. Although workplace testing is not as prevalent outside of the United States as within, the international Government and Clinical markets are somewhat in concert with their United States counterparts. One market that is significantly more prevalent outside of the United States is roadside drug testing. We sell in this market through a select network of distributors.
 Contract Manufacturing
 
 We provide strip manufacturing and assembly and packaging services to non-affiliated diagnostic companies. In Fiscal 2020, we manufactured a test for the detection of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus; the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide), a test for Malaria (a disease transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes) and we manufactured a special custom panel of our Rapid TOX as a private label. Fiscal 2020 contract manufacturing sales did not represent a significant portion of our revenue.

  Competition
 
 We compete on the following factors:
 
 Pricing: The pricing structure in our markets is highly competitive. We offer the only drug testing products that contain testing strips that are 100% manufactured in the US and that is 100% assembled in the United States. Price pressure is the greatest when comparing our pricing with pricing of products manufactured outside of the United States.
 
 Quality: We manufacture, assemble and package our testing strips and products completely in the United States in accordance with quality system regulations set forth by FDA. Many companies in our industry claim their products are manufactured in the United States when in fact; their products are only assembled or packaged in the Unites States. The testing strips and in most cases the assembly of the product is done outside of the Unites States; usually in China. Products manufactured outside of the United States are generally manufactured outside of the requirements of quality system regulations set forth by FDA. In our opinion, this results in inferior, sub-par products being offered in the market. Most of our markets require accurate detection near the cut-off level of the test. Our products are manufactured to detect drug use closer to the cut-off level of the test. The majority of the drug tests on the market today are less “aggressive”; meaning they are not as sensitive and they will miss positive results. Missing positive results can be extremely troublesome to customers from both an economic and liability perspective; and in the clinical market, missing positives can be a threat to the health of the individuals being tested. We do offer products manufactured outside of the United States via distribution relationships to those customers that do not require accuracy near or at the cutoff level in their drug testing programs.
 
 Customer and technical support: Our customers often need guidance and assistance with certain issues, including but not limited to, test administration, drug cross reactivity and drug metabolism. We provide our customers with continuous customer and technical support on a 24/7/365 basis; staffed by our employees. We believe that this support gives us a competitive advantage since our competitors do not offer this “employee staffed” extended service to their customers.
 
  Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
 The primary raw materials required for the manufacture of our test strips and our drug tests consist of antibodies, antigens and other reagents, plastic molded pieces, membranes and packaging materials. We maintain an inventory of raw materials. Currently, most raw materials are available from several sources. We own the molds and tooling for our plastic components that are custom and proprietary. The ownership of these molds affords us flexibility and control in managing the supply chain for these components. We do not own the molds and tooling for plastic components that are “stock” items.
 Major Customers
 
 One of our customers accounted for 35.2% and 44.8% of net sales in Fiscal 2020 and in the year ended December 31, 2019 (“Fiscal 2019”), respectively.
 
  Patents and Trademarks/Licenses
 
 As of December 31, 2020, we have 23 patents issued related to our testing products affording protection in 15 different countries outside the United States and we hold 11 patents in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we have 2 foreign patent applications pending. We are incurring fees related to these patent applications that will be capitalized over the term of the patents.
 
 As of December 31, 2020, we have 15 trademarks registered in the United States and 10 trademarks registered in countries/regions such as Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.

  Government Regulations
 
  DOA Products
 
 In certain markets, the development, testing, manufacture and sale of our drug tests, and possible additional testing products for other substances or conditions, are subject to regulation by the United States and foreign regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and associated regulations, the FDA regulates the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. When a product is a medical device, a 510(k) marketing application must be submitted to the FDA. A 510(k) is a premarketing submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is safe and effective. Applicants must compare their 510(k) device to one or more similar devices currently being marketed in the United States. Most of our urine-based products are marketed and sold in the Clinical market (in addition to other markets) and therefore, we have obtained 510(k) marketing clearance, CLIA waiver (see below) and/or Over-The-Counter (OTC) marketing clearance on our urine based products. Our oral fluid products are not 510(k) cleared; so we can only market and sell these products to the forensic market, the employment market (under a limited exemption issued by FDA in July 2017) and for export outside the United States.
 
 In order to sell our products in Canada, we must comply with ISO 13485:2003, the International Standards Organization’s Directive for Quality Systems for Medical Devices (MDD or Medical Device Directive), and in order to sell our products in the European Union, we must obtain CE marking for our products (in the European Union, a “CE” mark is affixed to the product for easy identification of quality products). Collectively, these standards are similar to FDA regulations, and are a reasonable assurance to the customer that our products are manufactured in a consistent manner to help ensure that quality defect-free goods are produced. As of the date of this report, we have received approval and the right to bear the CE mark on our Rapid Drug Screen, Rapid ONE, Rapid TOX, RDS InCup, Rapid TOX Cup II, Rapid Reader and OralStat. We are currently certified to I.S. EN ISO 13485:2016 with an expiration date of July 31, 2021. We do currently have our products registered to allow sale in Canada. In Fiscal 2020, we decided not to renew our product licenses in Canada due to significant increased costs of licensing compared to the negligible sales we had in Canada.
 
 The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 established quality standards for laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. As a result, those using CLIA waived tests are not subject to the more stringent and expensive requirements of moderate or high complexity laboratories. We have received CLIA waiver from the FDA related to our Rapid TOX product line and OTC clearance on our Rapid TOX Cup II product line (the OTC clearance of the Rapid TOX Cup II product line means they are CLIA waived products).
 
 Due to the nature of the manufacturing of our drug tests, the products we offer through contract manufacturing and the raw materials used for both, we do not incur any material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws, nor do we experience any material effects of compliance with environmental laws.
 
  Covid-19 Testing Products
 
 Covid-19 related testing products are (as of the date of this report), being marketed and sold in the United States under the March 2020 Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) policy set forth by the FDA. An EUA is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including testing devices, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In order for a product to be marketed under the EUA policy, a number of requirements must be met. Under the policy, commercial manufacturers can develop and distribute Covid-19 test kits after validation of the test and before EUA submission. The anticipated timeframe for commercial manufacturers to prepare and submit an EUA is fifteen (15) business days after notification of completion of validation. FDA expects validation data to be provided for review informally by email at the time of notification. FDA also expects the manufacturer to make the instructions for use and the performance characteristics available on the manufacturer’s website while it awaits EUA determination from FDA. Any clinical testing completed during the review period should include a statement that the test is validated but that the FDA’s review is pending. The Covid-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette we began distributing in March 2020 detects Covid-19 antibodies in whole blood, serum or plasma. The test is not available for consumer use and is being marketed in full compliance with FDA EUA. The Logix Smart Covid-19 Test we began distributing in October 2020 is also being marketed in full compliance with FDA EUA. The Rapid Covid-19 Antigen Test Cassette we began distributing in December 2020 is currently being marketed to only locations outside the United States. In order to sell Covid-19 tests to locations within Europe, the products must be CE marked. All three of the Covid-19 testing products referenced herein bear CE marking.
