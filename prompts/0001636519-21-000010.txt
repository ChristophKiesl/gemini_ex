Item 1. Business
Madison Square Garden Sports Corp., formerly The Madison Square Garden Company, is a Delaware corporation with our principal executive offices at Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY, 10121. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “MSG Sports” or the “Company” refer collectively to Madison Square Garden Sports Corp., a holding company, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. We conduct substantially all of our business activities discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K through MSG Sports, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our telephone number is 212-465-1111, our website is http://www.msgsports.com and the investor relations section of our website is http://investor.msgsports.com. Through the investor relations section of our website, we make available, free of charge, the Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements, as well as any amendments to those reports and other statements filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These materials become available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Copies of these filings are also available on the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov).

The Company was incorporated on March 4, 2015 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MSG Networks Inc. (“MSG Networks”). All of the outstanding common stock of the Company was distributed to MSG Networks shareholders (the “MSGS Distribution”) on September 30, 2015 (the “MSGS Distribution Date”).
On April 17, 2020 (the “MSGE Distribution Date”), the Company distributed all of the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. (formerly MSG Entertainment Spinco, Inc. and referred to herein as “MSG Entertainment”) to its stockholders (the “MSGE Distribution”). MSG Entertainment owns, directly or indirectly, the entertainment business previously owned and operated by the Company through its MSG Entertainment business segment and the sports booking business previously owned and operated by the Company through its MSG Sports business segment. In the MSGE Distribution, (a) each holder of the Company’s Class A common stock received one share of MSG Entertainment Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every share of the Company’s Class A common stock held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on April 13, 2020 (the “Record Date”), and (b) each holder of the Company’s Class B common stock received one share of MSG Entertainment Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every share of the Registrant’s Class B common stock held of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on the Record Date.
On July 9, 2021 MSG Networks merged with a subsidiary of MSG Entertainment and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MSG Entertainment (the “MSGE-MSGN Merger”). Accordingly, agreements between the Company and MSG Networks are now effectively agreements with MSG Entertainment on a consolidated basis.
Overview
The Company owns and operates a portfolio of assets featuring some of the most recognized teams in all of sports, including the New York Knickerbockers (“Knicks”) of the National Basketball Association (“NBA”) and the New York Rangers (“Rangers”) of the National Hockey League (“NHL”). Both the Knicks and the Rangers play their home games in Madison Square Garden Arena (“The Garden”), also known as The World’s Most Famous Arena. The Company’s other professional franchises include two development league teams — the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (“AHL”) and the Westchester Knicks of the NBA G League (“NBAGL”). In addition, the Company owns Knicks Gaming, an esports franchise that competes in the NBA 2K League, as well as a controlling interest in Counter Logic Gaming (“CLG”), a North American esports organization. The Company also operates two professional sports team performance centers — the Madison Square Garden Training Center in Greenburgh, NY and the CLG Performance Center in Los Angeles, CA. 
Our Strengths
•Iconic sports franchises with renowned brands;
•Enduring and meaningful presence in the New York metropolitan area, one of the nation’s largest media markets;
•Deep connections with large and passionate fan bases that span a wide demographic mix;
•Multi-year sponsorship and suite agreements through a strategic partnership with MSG Entertainment;
•Long-term local media rights agreements with MSG Networks;
•National media rights agreements through the NBA and NHL;
•Long-term arena license agreements with MSG Entertainment under which the Knicks and the Rangers play their home games at The Garden; 
•World-class organization with expertise in team operations, event presentation and ticketing; and
•Seasoned management team and committed ownership.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage the strength and popularity of our professional sports franchises and our unique position in one of the nation’s largest media markets to grow our business and increase the long-term value of our sports assets. Key components of our strategy include:
•Developing championship-caliber teams. Our core goal is to develop and maintain teams that consistently compete for championships. Competitive teams help support and drive revenue streams across the Company during the regular season and, when our teams qualify for the postseason, the Company benefits from incremental home playoff games. The ownership and operation of NBA and NHL development teams — the Westchester Knicks and the Hartford Wolf Pack — as well as the operation of our two state-of-the-art professional sports teams performance centers, are part of our strategy to develop championship-caliber teams.
•Employ a ticketing policy that gives the Company a direct relationship with our fanbases. Our large and loyal fan bases have placed us among the league leaders in ticket sales as our teams consistently play to at or near capacity crowds at The Garden. Tickets to our sports teams’ home games are sold through membership plans (full season and partial plans); group sales; and single-game tickets, which are purchased by fans on an individual basis (as opposed to third-party sales). We generally review and set the price of our tickets before the start of each team’s season; however, we dynamically price our single-game tickets to better align with fan demand. 
•Maximize the value of our exclusive live sports content. With today’s rapidly evolving media landscape, live sports telecasts have become increasingly valuable to distributors and advertisers. In October 2015, the Knicks and the Rangers entered into 20-year local media rights agreements with MSG Networks, creating a significant recurring and growing revenue stream for the Company. These agreements provide MSG Networks with exclusive local linear and digital rights to home and away games of the Knicks and the Rangers, as well as other team-related programming. MSG Networks makes this content available to our fans on its regional sports networks, MSG Network and MSG+, and through its live streaming and on-demand platform, MSG GO. In addition, our Company also receives a pro-rata share of fees related to the NBA’s and NHL’s national media rights agreements. Following the 2020-21 season, the NHL entered into national media rights agreements with The Walt Disney Company and WarnerMedia, LLC that will expire following the 2027-28 season. The NHL’s agreement with Rogers Communications (Canada) expires following the 2025-26 season. The NBA’s agreements with The Walt Disney Company and WarnerMedia, LLC expire after the 2024-25 regular season.
•Utilize our unique assets and an integrated approach to drive sponsorship and suite sales. Our Company possesses powerful and attractive assets that also benefit from being part of a broader sports, entertainment and media offering as a result of our Company’s various agreements with MSG Entertainment. These agreements enable us to partner with MSG Entertainment on an integrated approach to marketing partnerships and corporate hospitality solutions to drive sponsorship, signage and suite sales. For example:
◦Our assets are highly sought after by companies that value the popularity of our sports franchises, the demographic makeup of our fans, and our unique position in the New York market. The attractiveness of our assets is further strengthened by the Sponsorship Sales and Service Representation Agreements and Arena License Agreements with MSG Entertainment which create compelling, broad-based marketing platforms by combining our professional sports brands and MSG Entertainment’s live entertainment and media assets. This integrated approach to marketing partnerships — which delivers unrivaled sports, entertainment and media exposure in the New York market — has already attracted world-class partners such as JPMorgan Chase, Anheuser-Busch, Spectrum, Delta Air Lines, DraftKings, Kia, Lexus, PepsiCo, and Squarespace. In addition, our presence in esports with CLG and Knicks Gaming provides us with the opportunity to introduce both our existing marketing partners and new brands to esports’ global fan base, primarily comprised of millennials and Generation Z — attractive, yet hard-to-reach, demographics for advertisers.
◦Our Arena License Agreements with MSG Entertainment enable MSG Entertainment to offer corporate hospitality solutions that bring together our live sporting events with MSG Entertainment’s live entertainment offerings and provide for the sharing of revenues from such offerings. For example, The Garden offers a variety of suite and club products, including 21 Event Level suites, 58 Lexus Madison Level suites, 18 Signature Level suites, the Madison Club, Suite Sixteen and the Loft Club. These suites and clubs — which provide exclusive private spaces, first-class amenities and some of the best seats in The Garden — are primarily licensed to corporate customers with the majority being multi-year agreements, most of which have annual escalators. We believe the unique combination of our live sporting events and MSG Entertainment’s 
live entertainment offerings, along with the continued importance of corporate hospitality to our guests, positions us well to continue to grow this area of the business.
•Continue to invest in the fan experience. The strong loyalty of our fans has been driven in part by our commitment to the fan experience, which we will continue to build on through our relationship with MSG Entertainment, owner and operator of The Garden. Working with MSG Entertainment, we offer first-class operations, innovative event presentation, premium food and beverage offerings, and unique and exclusive merchandise, as well as venue and team apps designed to create a seamless experience for our fans. Our goal is to deliver the best in-venue experience in the industry — whether our guests are first-time visitors, repeat customers, season ticket holders, suite holders or club members.
Our Business
Our Sports Franchises 
New York Knicks
As an original franchise of the NBA, the Knicks have a rich history that includes eight trips to the NBA Finals and two NBA Championships, as well as some of the greatest athletes to ever play the game. The team also has a large and passionate fan base that spans a wide demographic mix. The Knicks 2020-21 season was highlighted by a return to the playoffs, as the team secured the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. Head coach Tom Thibodeau won the NBA’s Coach of the Year award, while forward Julius Randle was named the NBA’s Most Improved Player before also being selected for the 2020-21 All-NBA Second Team. The Knicks will look to build on this success in the 2021-22 season. 
New York Rangers
The Rangers hockey club is one of the NHL’s “Original Six” franchises. Heading into its 95th season, the Rangers are a storied franchise and one of the league’s marquee teams, with four Stanley Cup Championships and one of the most passionate, loyal and enthusiastic fan bases. For the 2020-21 season, Adam Fox became the fourth Ranger in franchise history to win the Norris Trophy for best defenseman in the NHL. The Rangers announced in May 2021 that Chris Drury had been promoted to President and General Manager and in June 2021, introduced a new head coach, Gerard Gallant. 
Westchester Knicks
In March 2014, the Company acquired the right to own and operate an NBAGL team, the Westchester Knicks. The team serves as the exclusive NBAGL affiliate of the Knicks and plays its home games at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, NY. 
Hartford Wolf Pack
The Hartford Wolf Pack, a minor-league hockey team, is the player development team for the Rangers and is also competitive in its own right in the AHL. The Rangers send draft picks and other players to the Hartford Wolf Pack for skill development and injury rehabilitation, and can call up players for the Rangers roster to enhance the team’s competitiveness and further develop its players.
Counter Logic Gaming
Founded in 2010, CLG is a North American esports organization respected for its championship legacy and passionate fanbase. CLG fields teams across leading esports titles: “League of Legends,” “Fortnite,” “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,” “Apex Legends,” “Super Smash Bros,” and “Valorant.” CLG has won multiple championships throughout its history — most notably the League of Legends LCS North American Championship in Summer 2015 and Spring 2016, and has represented North America in the League of Legends World Championships four times.
Knicks Gaming
Knicks Gaming, our esports franchise that competes in the NBA 2K League, was one of the inaugural teams when the league debuted in 2018. Knicks Gaming also won the first-ever NBA 2K League Championship title in August 2018.
Arena License Agreements 
Madison Square Garden, the World’s Most Famous Arena (“The Garden”), is the home for the Knicks and the Rangers pursuant to Arena License Agreements with MSG Entertainment. The Arena License Agreements provide revenue opportunities through the sharing of certain suites and clubs, sponsorship and signage, food and beverage, merchandise and sales arrangements with MSG Entertainment. The Arena License Agreements have a term of 35 years. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Our Professional Sports Teams Performance Centers 
The Company owns the state-of-the-art Madison Square Garden Training Center in Greenburgh, NY. The approximately 114,000 square-foot facility features two basketball courts and one NHL regulation-sized hockey rink, and is equipped with well-appointed private areas and office space and exercise and training rooms with dedicated equipment for each team as well as the latest technology and other first-class amenities.
In addition, the Company operates the CLG Performance Center in Los Angeles, CA, which includes unique competition spaces tailored to the Company’s esports game franchises, as well as a studio and editing bay for video productions and outdoor areas that can be used to hold fan events.
Impact of COVID-19
COVID-19 disruptions have materially impacted the Company’s revenues and the Company recognized materially less revenues, or in some cases no revenues, across a number of areas. Those areas include: ticket sales; the Company’s share of suite licenses; sponsorships; signage and in-venue advertising at The Garden; and food, beverage and merchandise sales. In addition, the Knicks and the Rangers played fewer games during the 2020-21 regular seasons, with the NBA playing a 72-game regular season schedule and the NHL playing a 56-game regular season schedule. These compare to traditional 82-game regular season schedules for both the NBA and NHL. In addition, while games have resumed at The Garden, until May 2021, fan attendance was limited due to ongoing government-mandated assembly restrictions.
On March 11 and 12, 2020, the NBA and NHL, respectively, suspended their 2019-20 seasons due to COVID-19. At the time the seasons were suspended, the Knicks had 16 games remaining, including eight home games, and the Rangers had 12 games remaining, including five home games. On May 26, 2020, the NHL announced return-to-play plans for 24 teams which began August 1, 2020. The Rangers were among the teams that returned to play in a 24-team tournament. On June 4, 2020, the NBA announced plans to resume play on July 30, 2020 with 22 teams. The Knicks were not among the teams that returned to competition. As a result, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 the Company recognized certain revenues that otherwise would have been recognized during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020.
In connection with the MSGE Distribution, we entered into the Arena License Agreements with MSG Entertainment. The Garden was not available for use between April 17, 2020 and the start of the NBA and NHL 2020-21 seasons in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively, due to the government-mandated suspension of events in response to COVID-19, and as a result, the Company was not required to pay license fees to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements.
On December 16, 2020 and January 14, 2021, respectively, the Knicks and the Rangers resumed playing their homes games at The Garden as part of their 2020-21 seasons. However, fans were initially prohibited from attending games due to government-mandated assembly restrictions. Effective February 23, 2021, New York venues with at least a 10,000-person capacity were permitted to operate at 10% capacity, and the Knicks and the Rangers began playing games at The Garden with a limited number of fans in attendance on February 23 and 26, respectively. When games were played at The Garden by the Knicks and the Rangers either without fans in attendance or with limited fans in attendance due to government mandated capacity constraints, the applicable license fees paid to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements were substantially reduced.
Effective May 19, 2021, event venues such as The Garden were permitted to host guests at full capacity, subject to certain restrictions, including, for example, restrictions for unvaccinated guests. As a result, the Knicks played three home playoff games with ticket sales of approximately 15,000-16,500 per game during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
During the fiscal year 2021, as a result of COVID-19, the Company implemented cost-reduction measures that included workforce reductions and limits on discretionary spending. In addition, as a result of the disruptions caused by COVID-19, certain operating expenses were reduced including (i) payments to MSG Entertainment under the Arena License Agreements, (ii) NBA league assessments and day-of-game expenses for Knicks and Rangers games, and (iii) league revenue sharing, net of escrow and team personnel expense. These expense reductions did not fully offset revenue losses. 
As a result of New York City regulations effective August 17, 2021, subject to certain exceptions, all guests 12 years of age or older and employees (other than players who are not residents of New York City) at indoor entertainment venues such as The Garden must show proof that they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Guests under the age of 12 must wear masks, provide proof of a negative COVID test and are permitted to enter only when accompanied by a vaccinated parent or guardian. 
At this time, we are unable to predict if there will be any longer-term effects due to these COVID-related disruptions. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Sports Business Risks — Our Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and May Continue to be, Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Government and League Actions Taken in Response” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Introduction — Factors Affecting Operating Results  — Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business.” 
The Role of the Leagues in Our Operations 
As franchises in professional sports leagues, our teams are members of their respective leagues and, as such, are subject to certain rules, regulations and limitations on the control and management of their affairs. The respective league constitutions of our sports teams, under which each league is operated, together with the collective bargaining agreements (each a “CBA”) that each of the NBA and NHL has signed with its players’ association, contain numerous provisions that, as a practical matter, could impact the manner in which we operate our businesses. In addition, under the respective league constitutions of our sports teams, the commissioner of each league, either acting alone or with the consent of a majority (or, in some cases, a supermajority) of the other sports teams in the league, may be empowered in certain circumstances to take certain actions believed to be in the best interests of the league, whether or not such actions would benefit our sports teams and whether or not we consent or object to those actions.
While the precise rights and obligations of member teams vary from league to league, the leagues have varying degrees of control exercisable under certain circumstances over the length and format of the playing season, including, for example, preseason and playoff schedules; the number of games in a playing season; the operating territories of the member teams; local, national and international media and other licensing rights; admission of new members and changes in ownership; franchise relocations; indebtedness affecting the franchises and their affiliates; and labor relations with the players’ associations, including collective bargaining, free agency, and rules applicable to player transactions, luxury taxes and revenue sharing. See “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Overview — Expenses.” Additionally, CLG operates multiple teams that participate in several different esports leagues. The rights and obligations of each CLG team (and member teams generally) vary from league to league. The leagues are generally empowered to and have implemented rules with respect to our league participation, as well as operation, and monetization of the CLG teams and brand. From time to time, we may disagree with or challenge actions the leagues take or the power and authority they assert, although the leagues’ governing documents and our agreements with the leagues purport to limit the manner in which we may challenge decisions and actions by a league commissioner or the league itself.
Media Rights
We generally license the local media rights for our sports teams’ home and away games. Subsidiaries of the Company have entered into media rights agreements with MSG Networks covering the local telecast and radio rights for the Knicks and the Rangers. Each agreement has a remaining term of approximately 14 years.
Our Community
The Company is committed to leveraging the power of its brands to benefit communities across the tri-state area. The Knicks and the Rangers both run grassroots programs - Junior Knicks and Junior Rangers - focused on eliminating barriers and creating more inclusive opportunities for all kids to enjoy basketball and hockey. The Company is also dedicated to affecting positive change through social impact and cause-related initiatives including food donations, providing free educational resources to local schools and supporting non-profits and fundraising efforts across the region. In February 2021, the Rangers helped make history by working with the Professional Women’s Hockey Players Association to bring women’s hockey to The Garden for the first time ever as part of the Association’s “Dream Gap Tour” to advance gender equality in the sport of hockey.
Our Company also has a close association with The Garden of Dreams Foundation (the “Foundation”), a non-profit organization that assists young people in need. In partnership with the Company and MSG Entertainment, the Foundation provides young people in our communities with access to educational and skills opportunities; mentoring programs and memorable experiences that enhance their lives, help shape their futures and create lasting joy. The Foundation focuses on young people facing illness or financial challenges, as well as children of uniformed personnel who have been lost or injured while serving our communities. Since it was established in 2006, the Foundation has impacted nearly 400,000 children and their families.
Regulation 
Our sports and entertainment businesses are subject to legislation governing the sale and resale of tickets and consumer protection statutes generally.
In addition, The Garden, like all public spaces, is subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by the state and local governments. The Garden is subject to zoning and outdoor advertising regulations and requires a number of licenses in order to operate, including occupancy permits, exhibit licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses and other authorizations and a zoning special permit granted by the New York City Planning Commission. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Economic and Business Relationship Risks — We Do Not Own The Garden and Our Failure to Renew the Arena License Agreements or MSG Entertainment’s Failure to Operate The Garden in Compliance with the Arena License Agreements or Extensive Governmental Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.” 
The professional sports leagues in which we operate, primarily the NBA and NHL, have the right under certain circumstances to regulate important aspects of our business, including, without limitation, our team-related online and mobile businesses. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Sports Business Risks — The Actions of the NBA, NHL and Esports Leagues May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
Our business is also subject to certain regulations applicable to our Internet websites and mobile applications, including data privacy laws in various jurisdictions. These include, but are not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and the recently passed California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”). These laws obligate us to comply with certain consumer and employee rights concerning data we may collect about these individuals. We maintain various websites and mobile applications that provide information and content regarding our business, offer merchandise and tickets for sale, make available sweepstakes and/or contests and offer hospitality services. The operation of these websites and applications may be subject to a range of other federal, state and local laws such as accessibility for persons with disabilities and consumer protection regulations. In addition, to the extent any of our websites seek to collect information from children under 13 years of age or are intended primarily for children under 13 years of age, they may be subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act which places restrictions on websites’ and online services’ collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age without prior parental consent. Our business is also subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including working conditions, labor, immigration and employment laws and health, safety and sanitation requirements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors “— Operational Risks — We Are Subject to Governmental Regulation, Which Can Change, and Any Failure to Comply With These Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.” 
Competition
Our business operates in a market in which numerous sports and entertainment opportunities are available. In addition to the NBA, NHL, AHL and NBAGL teams that we own and operate, the New York City metropolitan area is home to two Major League Baseball teams (the New York Yankees (the “Yankees”) and the New York Mets (the “Mets”)), two National Football League teams (the New York Giants (the “Giants”) and the New York Jets (the “Jets”)), two additional NHL teams (the New York Islanders (the “Islanders”) and the New Jersey Devils (the “Devils”)), a second NBA team (the Brooklyn Nets (the “Nets”)) and two Major League Soccer franchises (the New York Red Bulls and the New York City Football Club). In addition, there are a number of other amateur and professional teams that compete in other sports, including at the collegiate and minor league levels. New York is also home many other non-sports related entertainment options.
As a result of the large number of options available, we face strong competition for the New York area sports fan. We must compete with these other sporting events in varying respects and degrees, including on the basis of the quality of the teams we field, their success in the leagues in which they compete, our ability to provide an entertaining environment at our games and the prices we charge for our tickets. In addition, for fans who prefer the unique experience of NHL hockey, we must compete with the Islanders and Devils as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NHL hockey teams and the NHL itself. Similarly, for those fans attracted to the equally unique experience of NBA basketball, we must compete with the Nets as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NBA teams and the NBA itself. In addition, we also compete to varying degrees with other productions and live entertainment events for advertising and sponsorship dollars. 
The amount of revenue we earn is influenced by many factors, including the impacts of COVID-19, the popularity and on-court or on-ice performance of our sports teams and general economic conditions. In particular, when our sports teams have strong on-court and on-ice performance, we benefit from increased demand for tickets, potentially greater food and merchandise sales from increased attendance and increased sponsorship opportunities. When our sports teams qualify for the playoffs, we also benefit from the attendance and in-game spending at the playoff games. The year-to-year impact of team performance is somewhat moderated by the fact that a significant portion of our revenue derives from media rights fees, suite rental fees and sponsorship and signage revenue, all of which are generally contracted on a multi-year basis. Nevertheless, the long-term performance of our business is tied to the success and popularity of our sports teams. In addition, due to the NBA and NHL playing seasons, revenues from our business are typically concentrated in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year. The concentration of our revenues and expenses, however, was different in fiscal year 2021 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We own a controlling interest in CLG, a North American esports organization. Due to the nature of esports, CLG competes with other teams across North America and globally. CLG competes for sponsorship, merchandise rights, media rights, and event prize winnings. Esports teams vary in their amount of funding, size of existing business, and amount of social following, among other factors, which can impact our ability to compete effectively.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Sports Business Risks — Our Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations” and “— Our Business Is Substantially Dependent on the Continued Popularity and/or Competitive Success of the Knicks and the Rangers, Which Cannot Be Assured.”
Human Capital Resources
At MSG Sports, we believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital management objectives are to invest in and support our employees in order to attract, develop and retain a high performing and diverse workforce.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe the diverse perspectives and experiences of our employees enhance the value of the Company and produce a more vibrant, constructive, and engaging place to work, and we are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace. To advance these efforts, the Company, together with MSG Entertainment, established a Diversity and Inclusion Council (the “D&I Council”) in 2019. The D&I Council is a joint council comprised of employees from the Company and MSG Entertainment who have demonstrated a high level of passion and commitment to diversity and inclusion. The contributions of the D&I Council span both the Company and MSG Entertainment, providing strategic guidance to senior management of each company on diversity and inclusion initiatives, serving as a resource for all employees, and working to promote environments that foster inclusivity and employee engagement while enhancing communication among companies, departments, and employees.
Since its inception, several initiatives have advanced these objectives under the D&I Council’s guidance, including:
•Creation of employee resource groups such as the Black Employee Network, LatinX Employee Network, Pride Employee Network, Women’s Employee Network, Asian American Pacific Islander Network and Veterans Network, to build an internal support system for employees of different backgrounds and advance efforts in attracting, developing and retaining talent by promoting leadership and encouraging diversity and inclusion among all employees;
•Facilitation of a series of employee focus groups as well as ongoing listening sessions allowing employees to candidly address topics core to diversity and inclusion;
•Training programs including Conscious Inclusion Awareness Training and Interview Skills training with a focus on unconscious bias, a career development tool, and a learning system with comprehensive resources and training for employees and hiring managers;
•Focus on hiring of diverse employees including increasing the hiring of diverse entry level employees through external partnership programs;
•Ongoing partnerships with local and national organizations dedicated to supporting diverse communities; and
•Fostering broader awareness-building of diversity and inclusion efforts by facilitating community-focused panels, discussions and cultural events.
Talent
As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 415 full-time union and non-union employees and 242 part-time union and non-union employees.
We aim to attract top talent through our brands, as well as through the many benefits we offer. We aim to retain our talent by emphasizing our competitive rewards; offering opportunities that support employees both personally and professionally; and our commitment to fostering career development in a positive corporate culture.
Our performance management practice includes ongoing feedback and conversations between managers and team members, and talent reviews designed to identify potential future leaders and inform succession plans. We value continuous learning and development opportunities for our employees, which include: a career development tool; leadership development programs; a learning platform; and tuition assistance.
Our benefit offerings are designed to meet the range of needs of our diverse workforce and include: domestic partner coverage; medical, dental and vision plan options; life insurance benefits for the employee and their dependents; a generous 401k plan with 100% employer match; an employee assistance program which also provides assistance with child and elder care resources; legal support; wellness programs and financial planning seminars. These resources are intended to support the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our employees.
In addition, approximately 16% of our employees were represented by unions as of June 30, 2021, all of whom are our players. There are no union employees subject to CBAs that expired as of June 30, 2021 and no union employees subject to CBAs that will expire by June 30, 2022.
Labor relations in general and in the sports industry in particular can be volatile, though our current relationships with our unions taken as a whole are positive. The NBA players and the NHL players are covered by CBAs between the National 
Basketball Players Association (“NBPA”) and the NBA and between the NHL Players’ Association (“NHLPA”) and the NHL, respectively. Both the NBA and the NHL have experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues in the future. On June 30, 2011 the prior CBA between the NBA and NBPA expired and there was a work stoppage for approximately five months until a new CBA was entered into in December 2011. The NBA CBA expires after the 2023-24 season (although each of the NBA and the NBPA has the right to terminate the CBA effective following the 2022-23 season). On September 15, 2012 the prior CBA between the NHL and NHLPA expired and there was a work stoppage for approximately four months until a new CBA was entered into in January 2013. The current NHL CBA expires after 2025-26 season (with the possibility of a one year extension in certain circumstances). The NBA and NHL playoff games for the 2019-20 seasons experienced postponements due to player, team and/or league protests and decisions.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Economic and Business Relationship Risks — Organized Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
COVID-19
At MSG Sports, the health and safety of our employees and athletes is our top priority. In response to COVID-19, significant measures have been taken to ensure that best practice health and safety protocols are in place and enforced throughout our offices, the Madison Square Garden Training Center, CLG Performance Center and team personnel areas at The Garden.
