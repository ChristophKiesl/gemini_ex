 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The following description of our business contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above in the Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements or in Section 1A under the heading "Risk Factors" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Introduction
Through our online Retail business, we offer a broad range of price-competitive products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, and housewares, among other products. We sell our products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co, www.overstock.ca, and www.overstockgovernment.com (referred to collectively as the "Website"). Although our four websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all four websites. Our Retail business initiatives are described in more detail below under "Our Retail Business". 
Our Medici business initiatives include our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures, Inc. ("Medici Ventures"), which conducts the majority of its business through its majority-owned subsidiary tZERO Group, Inc. ("tZERO"), a leader in blockchain innovation and liquidity for digital assets. Our Medici business initiatives seek to create or foster a set of products and solutions that leverage blockchain technology to generate efficiencies and increase security and control in six areas: identity management, property rights and management, central banking and currencies, capital markets, supply chains and commerce, and voting systems. Medici Ventures owns strategic majority and minority equity interests in several blockchain-related companies, each of which focuses on at least one of the areas mentioned above. Our Medici business initiatives are described in more detail below under "Our Medici Business—Medici Ventures" and our tZERO business initiatives are described in more detail below under "Our Medici Business—tZERO". As described below, in January 2021, we announced significant changes in the management of our Medici Business.
Our company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded as a Utah limited liability company ("LLC") in 1997, reorganized as a C Corporation in the State of Utah in 1998, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2002. We launched our initial website in March 1999. As used herein, "Overstock", "Overstock.com", "the Company", "we", "our" and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
Our Retail Business
For the last three fiscal years, our Retail business has generated nearly all of our net revenues. In our Retail business, our goal is to provide goods to furnish and accessorize "Dream Homes for All", particularly for our target customers—consumers who seek smart value on quality, stylish merchandise at competitive prices. We offer millions of products of which over 99% were in-line products (products in active production). We believe that the furniture and home goods market, which is highly fragmented and has traditionally been served by brick and mortar stores, will continue transitioning to online sales, particularly as Millennial consumers (which we define as those born between 1981 - 1996), who are generally comfortable shopping online, start families and move into new homes. We regularly update our product assortment to meet the evolving preferences of our customers and current trends. Our products include, among others, furniture, home décor including area rugs, bedding and bath, home improvement, and kitchen and dining items. We compete primarily based on:
•Simple and easy customer experience with an emphasis on price, value, and quality with a wide assortment of products delivered in a personalized format with the convenience of our mobile app, and with the benefits of our award-winning customer care;
•Proprietary technologies which we believe help us provide our customers with an intuitive shopping experience;
•Logistics capabilities tailored to the furniture and home furnishings category and developed over our many years of e-commerce experience; 
•Long-term mutually beneficial relationships with our partners, which numbered approximately 3,000 as of December 31, 2020; and
•Our Club O Loyalty Program, which we believe increases customer engagement and retention.
For 2020, nearly all our Retail sales through our Website were from transactions in which we fulfilled orders through our network of approximately 3,000 third-party manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers ("partners") selling on our Website. Our use of the term "partner" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our retail partners. We provide our partners with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. Our supply chain allows us to ship directly to our customers from our suppliers or from our warehouses. Our warehouses primarily fulfill orders from direct sales of our partners owned inventory, including some customer returns of partner products. Our warehouses ship over 2,000 packages per day on average and up to approximately 3,200 packages per day during peak periods. 
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 our sales were almost entirely to customers located in the United States and no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue. 
Additional Offerings
We offer additional products or services that may complement our primary retail offerings but are not significant to our retail revenues, including: 
•Businesses advertising products or services on our Website;
•Our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using third party logistics providers; and
•Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, and obtain multi-channel fulfillment services through our distribution network.
Manufacturer, Distributor, and Supplier Relationships
To the extent possible we maintain manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships, and seek new manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Generally, our manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers regularly communicate to us the quantity of products that are held in reserve for us, but our arrangements with them generally do not guarantee the availability of those products for a set duration. Our manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships are based on historical experience and are generally non-exclusive and we retain the right to select and change our suppliers at our discretion. Generally, manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers do not control the terms under which products are sold through our Website.
Sales and Marketing
We use a variety of methods to target our retail consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail, and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, video on demand, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.
Customer Service
We are committed to providing superior customer service. We staff our customer service department with dedicated in-house and outsourced professionals who respond to phone, SMS, instant online chat, and e-mail inquiries on products, ordering, shipping status, returns, and other areas of customer inquiry.
Technology
We use our internally developed Website and a combination of proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies and solutions to support our Retail operations. We use the services of multiple telecommunications companies to obtain connectivity to the Internet. Currently, our primary computer infrastructure is in a data center in Utah. We also have other data centers which we use for backups, redundancy, development, testing, disaster recovery, and corporate systems infrastructure.
Competition
E-commerce is intensely competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. We believe that competition in this industry is based predominantly on:
•price;
•product quality and assortment;
•shopping convenience;
•website organization and load speed;
•order processing and fulfillment;
•order delivery time;
•customer service;
•website functionality on mobile devices;
•brand recognition; and
•brand reputation.
We compete with other online retailers, traditional retailers, and liquidation "brokers" which may specifically adopt our methods and target our customers. We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies that can be divided into several broad categories:
•online discount general retailers;
•online private sale sites;
•online specialty retailers;
•online liquidators;
•online retailers who have or are developing significant "brick and mortar" capabilities; and 
•traditional general merchandise and specialty retailers and liquidators, many of which have a significant online presence.
Many of our current and potential e-commerce competitors have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. Further, any of them may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger, more established and well-financed companies, including exclusive distribution arrangements with our vendors or service suppliers that could deny us access to key products or needed services, or acquisitions of our suppliers or service providers, having the same effect. Many of them do or could devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to their website and systems development than we do. Many have supply chain operations that decrease product shipping times to their customers, have options for in-store product pick-up, allow in-store returns, or offer other delivery and returns options that we do not have. New technologies, the continued enhancement of existing technologies, developments in related areas such as same-day product deliveries, and the development of proprietary delivery systems increase competitive pressures on us. 
Financial Information about Business Segments and Geographic Areas
As described further in Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"—Note 25—Business Segments, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined our segments based on how we manage our business, which, in our view, consists primarily of our Retail and Medici businesses. Our Retail business is a reportable segment. As described below, our Medici business is comprised of multiple components or operating segments, including our tZERO and Medici Ventures reportable segments. We use pre-tax net income (loss) as the measure to determine our reportable segments. As a result, tZERO and Medici Ventures are the only reportable segments of our Medici business as they are quantitatively significant. The remaining Medici business operating segments are not significant and are included in Other. See Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"—Note 25—Business Segments for information regarding our business segments and geographical areas.
Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets
We regard our domain names and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Included in our intellectual property is some of the financial technology we have developed as part of our Medici initiatives. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates, and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including the law pertaining to trade secrets.
Our Medici Business
In late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technologies. We pursue these initiatives through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures, and its majority-owned subsidiary tZERO. These initiatives remain in the start-up phase, and neither Medici Ventures nor tZERO has generated significant revenues from any blockchain-based technology or application of blockchain technology. As described below under "—Pelion Transaction Agreement", we announced significant changes in the oversight of the Medici Business in January 2021.
Medici Ventures
Medici Ventures' strategy is to create or foster a set of products and solutions that leverage blockchain technology to generate efficiencies and increase security and control in six areas: identity management, property rights and management, central banking and currencies, capital markets, supply chains and commerce, and voting systems. A blockchain is a cryptographically secured, distributed infrastructure, or network, which may be accessed and, in some cases, maintained by each member of the network. The majority of Medici Ventures' business is its approximately 80% interest in tZERO (as of December 31, 2020), which, as described below, is a financial technology company pursuing potential financial applications for blockchain technologies. Medici Ventures also owns strategic majority and minority equity interests in several blockchain-related companies, each of which focuses on at least one of the areas mentioned above. All the companies in which Medici Ventures holds strategic equity interests are startup businesses, businesses in the development stage, or businesses with a short operating history. As a result of the transaction described below in "—Pelion Transaction Agreement", Medici Ventures has discontinued providing the services of its software engineers, developers, or other technologists to other blockchain companies. Seats on the boards of these companies held by Medici Ventures personnel are expected to be filled by nominees of Pelion following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Pelion Transaction Agreement. 
See "Risk Factors—Additional Risks Relating to our Medici Business."
tZERO

tZERO is a leader in blockchain innovation and liquidity for digital assets. The financial technology company is aiming to democratize access to private capital markets by focusing on the development and adoption of digital securities (which we define below). tZERO offers institutional-grade solutions for issuers looking to digitize their capitalization table through blockchain technology, and trade on a regulated alternative trading system. tZERO democratizes access to private assets by providing a simple, automated, and efficient trading venue to broker-dealers, institutions, and investors. tZERO has developed a suite of technologies (the "tZERO Technology Stack") that enables issuers to issue, and relevant regulated market participants to support the issuance, trading, clearance and settlement of digital securities. tZERO also supports the adoption of digital securities by developing the tZERO Technology Stack for use by regulated venues on which those digital securities can trade, as well as investing in subsidiaries and joint venture entities that own and operate such trading venues. These investments include the alternative trading system (the "tZERO ATS") run by its wholly-owned subsidiary, tZERO ATS, LLC, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")-registered broker-dealer which provides a regulated venue for matching buy and sell orders to its broker-dealer subscribers, including for the trading of digital securities, and its joint venture with BOX Digital Markets LLC ("BOX Digital"), intended to develop a U.S. national securities exchange facility with regulatory approvals enabling it to support trading in a type of digital security called a security token. Another wholly-owned subsidiary of tZERO, tZERO Markets, LLC ("tZERO Markets"), is an SEC-registered broker-dealer which offers a website, and in the future intends to provide a mobile application, that allows retail customers to conduct self-directed trading of digital securities. In addition, tZERO also maintains certain other businesses.
Throughout this report we refer to "digital securities" to describe conventional uncertificated securities where the issuer arranges for a digital "courtesy carbon copy" of the transfer agent's share registry to be viewable on the blockchain to enhance the investor's trading experience through added transparency, but which have no controlling legal effect. Securities with such digital enhancements may also be referred to as "digitally-enhanced securities". Digital securities, however, are not issued, traded, cleared, settled or custodied using distributed ledger or blockchain technology. Instead, record ownership of digital securities is kept by an SEC-regulated transfer agent in its traditional books and records and they are traded on the relevant regulated trading venues on a book-entry basis. To enhance the investor experience, issuers arrange for a digital courtesy carbon copy of the transfer agent's share registry of holders of record to be viewable on the blockchain. The digital courtesy carbon copy of the transfer agents' books and records on the blockchain are pseudonymized (that is, such records do not identify the holders of record by name but each holder's assets are shown under a digital wallet address) and do not govern ownership of these securities. The transfer agent's conventional books and records remain as the only controlling record of ownership for corporate and securities law purposes. With respect to investors holding a digital security in a brokerage account, the controlling record of the underlying beneficial ownership is such investor's carrying broker-dealer's conventional books and 
records. The use of "digital" is intended solely to differentiate these securities from conventional securities which do not have the digital enhancements necessary to allow the transfer agents records to be viewable on the blockchain.
In certain other instances throughout this report we refer to "peer-to-peer digital assets" or "bearer digital assets", which may include virtual currencies or other pseudonymous bearer digital instruments (including instruments representing securities) which may trade peer-to-peer on a distributed ledger and/or rely on the distributed ledger to govern record ownership. In the future, subject to changes in the applicable regulatory landscape and the capabilities of market participants, tZERO may evolve its focus towards the advancement of digital securities, digital assets, and the integration of blockchain technology into them in other ways.
tZERO's businesses include the broker-dealer activities of its subsidiaries, tZERO ATS, LLC, SpeedRoute, LLC ("SpeedRoute"), and tZERO Markets, LLC. SpeedRoute provides connectivity to its registered broker-dealer clients to U.S. equity exchanges and off-exchange sources of liquidity. tZERO Markets, LLC offers a website, and in the future intends to offer a mobile application, that allows retail customers to conduct self-directed trading of digital securities. tZERO's remaining businesses include tZERO Crypto, Inc., a cryptocurrency wallet and exchange services business, and Verify Investor, LLC, an accredited investor verification company.
The businesses, products, and services that tZERO is pursuing or contemplating will require substantial additional funding, initially for technology development and regulatory compliance, as well as for working capital, marketing and sales, and other substantial costs of developing new products and businesses in emerging areas of technology. These costs have been and are expected to continue to be material, both to tZERO and to Overstock. See also "—Pelion Transaction Agreement" below.
tZERO's Intellectual Property 
tZERO has received certain patents that it views as critical to its success. In particular, in January 2019, it received a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") for an order system that can integrate with conventional asset trading platforms and translate orders for "digital transaction items" (including securities, tokens, shares, cash and other assets) from broker-dealers into orders on a regulated venue which utilizes blockchain technology. In May 2019, tZERO also received a patent for a base layer technology that uses digital signatures to record and verify time-series data such as trades, executions and settlements, allowing low-latency systems, including traditional matching engines or private blockchain ledgers, to be anchored into public blockchain ledgers which are able to verify the existence of previous trades and simultaneously produce an auditable and immutable record of those transactions. These patents to date have not had any material effect on tZERO's business. tZERO believes these patents provide valuable functionality to regulated market participants involved in the trading of digital securities and will assist in protecting tZERO's proprietary technologies against trading solutions developed by competitors.
tZERO's Customers
tZERO ATS, LLC and SpeedRoute, which are tZERO's primary sources of revenue, are reliant upon a small group of broker-dealer subscribers and clients, respectively, for a large part of their revenue. See "Risk Factors—Additional Risks Relating to our tZERO Initiatives—To date, SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC's revenues have come from a small number of major customers broker-dealer subscribers and clients, respectively, making SpeedRoute and tZERO ATS, LLC, and by extension tZERO, vulnerable to changes in the business and financial condition of, or demand for SpeedRoute's and tZERO ATS, LLC's services by, such subscriber or client."
tZERO's Competitors 
We believe other organizations are or may be working to develop applications for distributed ledger or blockchain technologies or other novel technologies in the financial industry or capital markets that may be competitive with tZERO and its blockchain-focused subsidiaries. Although it is difficult to obtain reliable information about blockchain activities by companies that may be our competitors, they may include numerous entities including some that are operating trading venues offshore or otherwise structured to avoid aspects of U.S. regulation.
SpeedRoute, tZERO ATS, LLC, and tZERO Markets compete with a large number of broker-dealers, many of which are substantially larger and have substantially greater financial resources than SpeedRoute, tZERO ATS, LLC, tZERO Markets, tZERO or Overstock.
See "Risk Factors—Additional Risks Relating to our tZERO Initiatives."
Pelion Transaction Agreement
On January 25, 2021, we and Medici Ventures entered into a transaction agreement (the "Transaction Agreement") with Pelion MV GP, L.L.C. ("Pelion"), and Pelion, Inc., as guarantor, pursuant to which the parties agreed, among other things, that Medici Ventures will change its entity type (the "Entity Change") to become a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership") and that Pelion will become the sole general partner of the Partnership, and we (along with any other stockholders of Medici Ventures at the time of Entity Change), will become the limited partners of the Partnership, pursuant to a limited partnership agreement to be entered into at the time of the Entity Change. In preparation for the Entity Change, we converted (i) our outstanding intercompany debt owed to us by Medici Ventures into shares of common stock of Medici Ventures and (ii) our intercompany debt from tZERO, into tZERO outstanding common stock, leaving Medici Ventures with 44% of tZERO outstanding common stock and Overstock with 43%. Pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement, we and any other limited partners will agree to make a capital commitment of $44.6 million to the partnership in proportion to our equity interest in the Partnership, upon 10 business days' prior written notice, which contributions may be in installments. Following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, Pelion will have sole authority and responsibility regarding investing decisions, appointing board members of the portfolio companies, and exercising all shareholder rights for assets Medici Ventures currently holds. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement is subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We expect the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement to be completed within approximately three to six months from the date of the Transaction Agreement. See Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"—Note 27—Subsequent Events for additional information.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
From time to time, we receive claims and become subject to regulatory investigations or other governmental actions, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, and other commercial litigation related to the conduct of our business. We also prosecute lawsuits to enforce our legal rights. Regulatory investigations and other governmental actions as well as any litigation may be costly and time consuming and can divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Regulatory investigations and other governmental actions as well as any such litigation may result in significant damages, associated costs, or equitable remedies relating to the operation of our business. Any such matters may materially harm our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
These matters and other types of claims could result in legal expenses, fines, adverse judgments or settlements and increase the cost of doing business. They could also require us to change our business practices in expensive and significant ways. In addition, litigation could result in interpretations of the law that may limit our current or future business, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise increase our costs.
Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business.
For further information, see (see Item 1A—"Risk Factors") and the information set forth under Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"—Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies, Legal proceedings and contingencies, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations, some of which apply or may apply to us as a result of our Retail business, some of which apply or may apply to us as a result of our Medici or tZERO businesses, and others of which apply to us for other reasons, such as our status as a publicly held company or the places in which we sell certain types or amounts of products. Our Retail business is subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, and other services we offer. Existing and future laws and regulations may result in increasing expense and may impede our growth. Applicable and potentially applicable regulations and laws include regulations and laws regarding taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, import and export matters, information 
reporting requirements, access to our services and facilities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics and quality of products and services, product labeling and unfair and deceptive trade practices.
Our efforts to expand our Retail business outside of the U.S. exposes us to foreign and additional U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to taxation, business licensing or certification requirements, advertising practices, online services, the use of cryptocurrency, the importation of specified or proscribed items, importation quotas, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, consumer and data protection, privacy, encryption, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties.
Our Medici and tZERO businesses are subject to general business regulations and laws, including some of those described above, but are also affected by a number of other laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to money transmitters and money services businesses, including the requirements of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("FinCEN") and state requirements applicable to money transmission, cryptocurrencies, provisions of various securities laws and other laws and regulations governing broker-dealers, alternative trading systems and national securities exchanges, anti-money laundering requirements, know-your-customer requirements, record-keeping, reporting and capital and bonding requirements, and a variety of other matters. Blockchain and distributed ledger platforms are recent technological innovations, and the regulation of peer-to-peer digital assets and conventional securities, insofar as blockchain technologies are applied to conventional securities, is developing. In the U.S., the businesses that we are working to develop are or may be subject to a wide variety of complex statutes and rules, most of which were implemented prior to the development of these technologies, and it is sometimes unclear whether or how various statutes or regulations apply. 
In addition, tZERO Markets is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") and is subject to regulation, examination, investigation and disciplinary action by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations with which it is registered or licensed or of which it becomes a member. As a result of the services in which tZERO Markets provides, including servicing retail customers, a number of these legal and regulatory requirements are new to tZERO's broker-dealer subsidiaries.
Furthermore, tZERO ATS, LLC operates the tZERO ATS and is, therefore, subject to Regulation ATS as well as other regulations, and partners with broker-dealers that are also subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA and whose regulatory compliance may impact tZERO ATS, LLC. Regulation ATS establishes the regulatory framework for alternative trading systems that match buy and sell orders but are exempt from registering as a national exchange under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Regulation ATS subjects tZERO ATS, LLC to various rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, quarterly reporting obligations on Form ATS. The tZERO ATS facilitates the trading of three digital securities, our Series A-1 preferred stock, TZROP (defined below), and Aspen Digital, Inc.'s depository receipts for its common stock ("ASPD") and, in the future, is expected to support digital securities from other issuers. Secondary resales of these digital securities must be conducted in compliance with federal and state securities laws which may additionally impact tZERO ATS, LLC.
The joint venture that tZERO and BOX Digital announced in June 2018 is seeking regulatory approvals that would enable the parties to operate the Boston Security Token Exchange ("BSTX"), a national securities exchange facility to support trading in a type of digital security called a security token. BSTX will require approval from the SEC prior to beginning operations. The SEC originally published proposed rule changes relating to BSTX on October 11, 2019, soliciting public comments thereon. Following subsequent amendments and resubmissions of the proposed rule changes relating to BSTX, the SEC disapproved of the proposal on December 18, 2020. BSTX is reviewing the order by the SEC to determine whether to refile the proposed rule changes. Were it to seek approval and be approved for operation by the SEC in the future, as a national securities exchange facility, BSTX would be subject to provisions of the Exchange Act and other rules and regulations applicable to national securities exchanges that are different than those applicable to tZERO's current operations, including, but not limited to, periodic and special examinations by the SEC.
See Item 1A—"Risk Factors—Additional Risks Relating to our Medici Business" and "Additional Risks Relating to our tZERO Initiatives." 
Human Capital Management
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,750 full-time employees. We seasonally increase our workforce during our fourth quarter to handle increased workload in both our warehouse and customer service operations. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be 
good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is high, particularly for software engineers and other technical staff. Overstock places great value on its human capital management and knows its people are critical to driving the business to success. We focus on our human capital management in many ways including:
Diversity & Inclusion
We embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce, our ways of thinking, and our decision-making. We know that fostering an inclusive culture delivers better business outcomes. Our commitments to improving diversity include 1) increasing the diversity of our team at all levels, 2) continuing real and meaningful gender and race dialogue within our company, 3) amplifying the voices of our underrepresented groups of employees, 4) fostering inclusion and safety within our walls, 5) expanding our company volunteer time off program to include efforts to combat gender and racial injustice, 6) continuing to condemn all forms of gender and racial discrimination and harassment, 7) encouraging our employees to vote by expanding our paid time off program, and 8) tracking and monitoring our progress. Among the many ways we demonstrate these commitments are through our hiring and development practices, flexible and working-parent-friendly programs, anti-discrimination policies, and efforts of our employee resource groups. 
Through our commitments, actions, words, investments, and values, we promote a work environment that enables employees to feel safe to express their ideas and perspectives and feel they belong within our team. 
Workforce Compensation & Pay Equity
The total rewards philosophy of Overstock and its subsidiaries is to create and maintain competitive programs that attract, motivate, develop, and retain employees based on the prevailing industry and geographic labor markets in those locations where the company does business. Competitive compensation programs consist of cash and non-cash compensation based on relevant pay factors designed to balance market competitiveness and cost containment to retain the human capital that enables the company to achieve business performance goals and objectives. Total rewards are designed to link the market competitiveness of each employee's compensation with overall Company performance, aligning employees' financial interests with the interests of the company.
Elements of our compensation package for all non-executive employees consists of base salary or wages, discretionary and non-discretionary short-term incentives to reward the achievement of behavioral goals and business objectives, and for eligible key contributors, long-term incentives to emphasize a more strategic alignment to support business performance. 
Changes in the value of each employee's job are monitored annually and adjustments in base pay and short-term incentives are awarded based on a combination of employee performance to pre-determined goals and the Company's overall performance to broader financial and operational goals and objectives. We determine external market competitiveness by gathering salary information from professionally managed third party salary surveys and by determining pay for individual employees based on their skill level, experience, education, and any other relevant compensatory factors. We use salary market data to create pay structures with pay bands. We assign every job to a pay band by comparing market data to pay band midpoints. We balance internal pay equity with external pay equity to ensure compensation is fairly and equitably dispersed.
Management is committed to the proposition that the total rewards of every employee in pay and benefits are equitably distributed regardless of their race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, color, veteran status, age, or disability. Furthermore, to ensure the commitment to pay equity is aggressively pursued, we define appropriate metrics from which progress can be tracked. The Human Resources Department prepares periodic reports for senior leadership and the Board of Directors to report progress toward equitable pay, promotions, and opportunities.
We offer all employees the ability to save for retirement by matching dollar for dollar up to six percent of their savings into a qualified savings plan up to certain pre-determined limits set by the IRS. For highly compensated employees who meet the salary threshold set by the IRS and who choose to continue pre-tax savings above the qualified savings plan limits, eligible employees can participate in a non-qualified tax deferred savings plan to save for future needs.
Our intention is to offer every employee fair and equitable cash compensation and competitive non-cash benefits to help employees manage their health and wellness and the health and wellness of their families.
Talent Acquisition & Retention
We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with universities, professional associations, and industry groups to proactively attract talent. We look for ways to improve our recruiting process regularly and ensure each applicant feels welcome and comfortable through the recruiting process. Our panel interviews are set up with a diverse group of interviewers to ensure for the best candidate experience. 
We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment, shared sense of purpose, desire to do the right thing and innovative work to attract talent to our company. We empower employees to find new and better ways of doing things and the scale of our business means that careers can develop in exciting and unexpected directions. To ensure the long-term continuity of our business, we actively manage the development of existing talent to fill the roles that are most critical to the on-going success of our Company.
In 2020, we hired 201 new employees, excluding our customer service department, and 682 new customer service employees. We have an average tenure of five years, with an average tenure of three years in customer service. 
Employee Engagement & Wellness
Creating a culture where all employees feel supported and valued is a key part of our corporate mission. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unique challenges, and we are striving to ensure the health, safety, and general well-being of our employees as we work through these pandemic-related challenges. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees' health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration. We offer comprehensive benefit options to our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples are medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal insurance, auto/home insurance, identity theft insurance and pet insurance, and a generous 401(k) matching program. In addition to these more traditional benefits offerings we also have programs that encourage better work/life balance. These benefits include an onsite medical clinic, fitness center, and child daycare at our largest facility, employee assistance program (EAP) support, and a 9/80 flexible work schedule. We offer paid parental leave for all new parents who have been with the Company for at least a year to ensure they are able to adjust to a new work/life balance. We also offer a caregiver benefit to parents who need to travel for work, which allows employees who have a child under the age of two to travel with the employee. We will also be exploring more remote working options in the coming months as we begin to return to the office in 2021.
Development & Training
We recognize how important it is for our employees to develop and progress in their careers. We provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including online development resources from a competency model development library to hundreds of online courses in our learning management system. We emphasize individual development planning as part of our annual goal setting process, and offer mentoring programs, along with change management and project management upskilling opportunities. We have leadership development resources for all leaders across the organization and continue to build tools for leaders to develop their teams on the job and in roles to create new opportunities to learn and grow. We also encourage certification, higher education, and continuing professional education by subsidizing these opportunities for our employees. 
We have an annual required training for all employees on the topic of Diversity and Inclusion. This program is designed to strengthen our organization by promoting the inclusion of various viewpoints from the natural talents and abilities of our people regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or other differences.
Company Culture
We attribute the high levels of employee engagement and retention to our corporate culture. The work environment is often described as results-driven, inclusive, generative, and collaborative. Our corporate vision, mission, values, leadership principles, and employee qualities help define who we are, where we are going, and the behavior we expect of the Company and our employees in order to be successful in the organization. 
In order to fulfill our vision of "Dream Homes for All" and the long-term financial goals of the Company, we focus on our mission of customer focus, our leading technology capabilities, and creating enterprise value. Our values articulate our commitment to an inclusive, outcome-driven, and positive work environment, and embody our generative culture and spirit. Our five leadership principles guide the interactions of our leaders with colleagues, creating a psychologically safe environment for productive and collaborative exchanges for improved outcomes. We clearly define, look for, measure, and develop eight qualities in our employees so that we all become empowered to be effective and valuable contributors in the organization. This culture allows us to attract, develop, engage, and retain highly qualified employees for each role in the organization. Our goal is to have every employee feel they are a valued member of a winning team, doing meaningful work, in an environment of trust. The Company regularly reinforces this culture throughout the entire employee experience.
Oversight & Governance
Our focus on human capital management has been a hallmark of the Company for years, understanding that people truly are a company's most valuable asset, and that culture is an organization's ultimate competitive advantage. Our 401(k) committee meets quarterly to review the plan and determine if any changes need to be made to the portfolio, in order to best serve our employees. Our board of directors dedicates ample time in quarterly meetings with management to discuss trends in hiring, engagement, and attrition. Our Compensation Committee is actively involved in determining competitive compensation strategies to help us continually improve in attracting, developing, and retaining top talent for our Company.
